@@5208741 NARRATOR : It was nearly 100 years ago . I was but a lone trapper then and would Spend my winters on Manitou Island , where Small game were plentiful . I 'd heard the legend of the Wendigo , But a man 's ignorance of things unseen is never questioned . Legend became life when I came face to face With the monstrous snow beast . It was a fierce battle that rocked the world . But through some grace of God , I was victorious , And my life would never again be the same . The moment I defeated the beast , I Realized I must protect the world From this evil monstrosity 's resurrection . Knowing the legend , I marked this spot , this sacred ground With the skulls of all the previous victims Of the Wendigo , creating a spiritual shield To protect the world . However , if the circle was ever broken , The Wendigo would be reborn once again , more powerful than ever . And now it is here , in this circle , that I 've remained .  I 'll drink to that . Here 's to the three-breasted women of good old Tibitan . And now , my good old friend , let 's Make a toast to ourselves . Another round , please . Thank you . This one 's mine . To my good friend , Larry . Who 's dad 's name was Barry . It 's so damn scary . His mom was so hairy . But I got to thank him for bringing me out early . Shooting them signs .

There is n't any private property on this island While we 're here . Ready ? Aim . Fire .  Woo , oo , oo . Oh , look , a fence . I guess we 're gon na have to turn back . What ? Something illegal 's going on here . Holy cow ! It 's murder , mass murder . Look at all them skulls . Where you going ? I 'm going inside . Man , let 's just get the hell outta here .  You leave my land . I 'm not about to let some old bum tell me where I ca n't hunt . Respect is an attribute , my friend , one you should learn . Respect ? I think you need to learn to respect The man with the high powered weapon in his hand . Hey , man , let 's just leave him alone . Leave me alone . I shall ask you once again to leave my land . You 've never seen one of these babies in action , old man . You think you might want a demonstration ? You have no idea what you may be the cause of . Let 's just get out of here , OK ?

No offense . We did n't even know Tony was bringing anybody , right ? No . No . No offense meant . My name 's Pete . Leo Phillips . You can call me Leo . Jerry . Lee . It TELVISION ANNOUNCER : This is Brick Branding in downtown Tecumseh . And at the top of our news , there 's a winter storm , Which has still not let up . All throughout the state , the rampages of the storm are being Felt . Over 100 schools have been forced to close down But the hardest hit is the Upper Peninsula . Not like the one's in ' 66 . Well . What have we got here ? I need to get to the island . First in the morning . No . I need to get to the island tonight . Lady , if we go out in that storm tonight ... Is there anyone else who can take me ? Lady , I 'm the only pilot here . If it 's that important , you can walk across the ice . OK . Well , I 've done more stupid things for a lot less money . Let 's go . Now , this is when the fight starts . I 'm driving out of my neighborhood When this black cat darts across the street , I mean right in front of us . No way on God 's green earth could we have missed it . Boom . I mean , you could hear it hit the bottom of the car . And by now , I 'm wondering if I was Ever meant to go on this trip . So Tony pulls the car over and we get out . Oh , come on , man , they do not want to hear the rest of this . No , we want to hear . Anyway , but anyway , we 're out of the car And we 're looking for this cat everywhere , and ca n't find it . All of a sudden , I hear this , boom , boom , boom . And I look around and there 's Tony kicking at the tire . And this cat 's laying there , all mangled and dead . Is this a joke ? No , it 's no joke . I mean , look we got out , and I did n't Even want to touch the things . Old Daniel Boone here , he has to put it in the first year . That 's where we should have left it . But Mr . Humanitarian here , he ca n't leave well enough alone . Well , you ca n't just leave somebody 's dead cat , I mean , mangled , lying on their front lawn . I mean , that 's disgusting . No , no , Your dinner was disgusting . So I picked up this cat and we 're Going to take it to the house . The weird thing was when we get to the porch , The front door flies open and this half Naked woman comes running out . I mean , she grabs this bloody pile out of my hands And she starts hugging . And I 'm going , oh , great , what are we supposed to do now ? I mean , this cat 's more important to her Than her husband . You know , but I said , look , I explained to her , lady , We did n't mean any harm by running over your cat . And besides , I thought I 'd offer her a couple of bucks for it . I did n't even think she 'd take it . But she says OK . So what do you think a cat 's worth ? $5 , $10 ? She told us it 's worth $2,000 . - Right . - What ? That 's what I said . No way . I do n't have $2,000 . For a cat ? So listen , I offer her $100 . Yeah , then I offer her $100 on top of that . $200 . And we 're driving away and we 're driving And this cop car comes barrelling Down the street , light flashing , the siren 's wailing . And they pull into her driveway . And I say , turn around , let 's go see what 's going on . So we turn around and when get back , The cops are with this lady , handcuffing her and putting her In their car . So I get out of the car and the cops walk right over to me And he goes , this yours ? And he hands me the $200 . I go , yes , officer . I go , what 's going on ? What did she do ? And he looks me right in the face . I mean dead in the face , like I did something wrong . And he goes , listen , son , everyone in this state Knows it 's illegal to sell pussy .  On you . That 's real funny . That 's really bad . Do you know the island very well ? Lady , I grew up here . I know everything about this place . Is there anything strange , like maybe some strange landmark In a weird shape or anything ? The only time anyone ever pays any attention to this island Is during deer season , which happens to start tomorrow . Few drunk hunters , fooling and shooting themselves . Ah , nothing ever happens out of the ordinary here . You ca n't think of anything or even anyone strange ? There is an old guy . He do n't bother nobody . And nobody do n't bother him . Sandy . You are the new guardian . And my powers have been passed on to you . As a guardian , it was my death that caused The release of the Wendigo . And it is your strength that will defeat it . During this time , the Wendigo 's strength will grow . And you will become weak . If the circle is not completed , you and many others will die . What was that ? Jesus ! Something 's jumping on the tail . The first sentinel . What ? What the hell is jumping on my plane ? You 've got to get down ! I ca n't even see . How in the hell can I land ? It 's on the plane . It 's tearing up the plane . You 've got to land . I told you I ca n't see two feet in front of me . How in the hell can I land ? It 's still out there . You 've got to get this plane down .      Hey , get up ! That thing out there . It 's coming ! What the hell are you doing , man ? That damn Wendigo . It 's out there ! Wait , wait . What the hell 's going on in here ? This guy just broke in and he 's messing up all your furniture . You guys got to listen . I know I sound like an old ' 50s B movie , But there 's a gigantic blue monster out there That 's called the Wendigo . And it 's already killed my buddy . Yeah , right . I got the munchies . Anybody else hungry ? I am . Me too . What do you got ? What did you call that thing ? The Wendigo . Me and my buddy , Dave , accidentally shot this old man And everything went nuts . The old guy melted down into a skeleton . Then it came alive . It grabbed Dave , smashed me in the face . I got up . I got hit . The Wendigo grabbed Dave and ripped His head clean off and put it on a pole Next to all these skeletons . The guy is nuts . I want some of my bodacious chili . Well , we ca n't do anything until morning . But I do n't understand all this business about the Wendigo . Yeah , it 's an old Algonquin Indian legend . In the middle of winter , when the winter storms have killed All the game , and there was no food anywhere , You know , the Indians would come in the middle of the night . And they 'd get one of their own people , and kill him . Then they 'd eat him . I 'm hungry . It 's just their word for cannibalism . There 's no such thing as a Wendigo . I mean , the Indians would say , in the middle of the night , The Wendigo ate Geronimo . It was just another excuse for their hunger . Tell that to Dave . No , you guys do n't understand . We 've got to round up everyone that 's left on this island And get out of here ! Hot chili . Listen , man , why do n't you get off of this ? Do you need a place to stay until you Come off your drunk , well fine , you can stay with us . As far as that monster stuff , nobody here Believes it , especially me . I would n't say that . Why ? Is it gon na get me ? Ah !  I told you it was real . I told you !  Look out . Put him out ! Put him out !  Help me ! Put him over there , on the cot . Be careful with him . Oh my god , what are we going to do ? I do n't know . We do n't have many choices . The hell we do n't ! We got ta get out of here ! I guess we 're stuck here until then .  I 'm going to get rid of this stuff . Not that it matters . That thing is everywhere anyways . Hey , Leo , Leo . Where you going ? Hey ! Come back here . You ca n't go out there . We ca n't let him go out in those woods . Let him go . What ? I said , let him go . Peter 's right . Leo is a hothead , but , I mean , after all , The guy did just lose a hand . Storm out there will cool him off . He 'll be in soon enough . OK , but it 's all your shoulders this time now . I 'm not going to take the rap for this one too . Listen , we do n't have time for Leo 's crying . If he wants to try and get out of here tonight , let him . The other two will stay here . When you find Duke , get back here , and we 'll take Jerry out . When I find Duke ? What do you mean when I find Duke ? I 'm not going to go out there . Hey , do n't worry . I 'll go along with you . Oh , great . That makes me feel real good . Two stooges against King Kong . I 'm no stooge , pal , I 'll have you know . I had an encounter with a Big Foot once . Come on . No , really . It was in a restroom in the Smoky Mountains . I think you 're talking about big ass , not foot . Actually , his whole body is quite large . And the phrase referring to his foot Actually denotes a small piece of his anatomy Which selectively refers to the ... Wait a minute , Tony , I thought you Did n't believe me in any of that hokey pokey legend stuff . I was skeptical myself , until I actually Encountered the Big Foot . Yeah . I 'll never forget the relief of finally getting To use a flush toilet and the sheer terror of coming face To face with the Sasquatch . Oh , sure . Big ass got ta poop too ? Hey , fellas , I do n't think Jerry 's doing too well here . He 's breathing 's real weird like there is n't any sometimes .  What was that ?  Be careful ! God . Help me , Please . Are you OK ? What happened ? What did you see ? Was it big ? What the hell 's going on ? What happened to Jerry over here ? Hold it , hold it ! Are you all right ? We were sleeping my boyfriend woke up . He thought he heard something rummaging outside . He went out to check . It 's all right . Do n't worry about it . Except the wind . The wind seemed to whisper . See , I told you , it whispers . It said , Wendigo , Wendigo . Great . Lay down over here and try and get some rest . No . Too hot . Hot . It 's too hot . Too hot . Hot . Hot Too hot .  Holy Toledo . Open the door ! What the Sam Hill 's going on here ? Open the door !  Come and get me , boys . Get it out of here . Who 's first for my tasty treats ? Grab her .  Let 's get it . Get it off me . Please get it off me . Want to dance ? I do n't know . It 's been awhile . Grab her . Throw the witch into the wall . One , two , three . Ah ! You 're all gon na die , whether you perish in this cabin Or out in the freezing cold . Shut up , bitch . Not even the chosen one can save you .   Leo , I do n't know how you dealt with being Out alone last night because I got a bad feeling about this . Yeah , unless it 's got US grade A prime ribs stamped On the side , and done medium well , You 've got a bad feeling about it . Look , I just do n't like being out here , that 's all . I mean we do n't know where that thing is . Yeah , well , it 's my guess that it 's just as safe out here As it is in that cabin . That 's right . You 're right . That 's right . It 's everywhere . And it 's everything . That 's right . He 's right . You 're right . What 's the matter with you , man ? Me ? Nothing . We just ca n't let that thing get the edge on us . No fooling . Jesus Christ . Oh , no . Oh , no , we 're never going to get out of here now , never , never . Hey , look over there . Duke 's still alive . These tracks are fresh . Come on . Let 's go get Duke . Wait .

We have received word that contact has been lost With Duke 's charter flight 401 . The plane was piloted by Duke Davis , owner and operator Of the charter service . Some of you may remember Duke from the winter of 1966 , When he single-handedly saved a group of hunters From Manitou Island during the severe blizzards Of that same year . We will now switch over live to Harve Lindquist , who is reporting to us from the Leelanau air tower . Harve . Yes , thank you , Jerry . This is Harve Lindquist live at the Leelanau air tower . And with us is Mr . Matt Hell ... oh , excuse me . Mr . Hell is the air traffic controller here at the tower . And I understand , Mr . Hell , that you were In contact with Duke Davis . Nice job . Nice job . Hey , easy on the touch down , there , guy . Easy . Sorry about that . That 's quite all right . You were saying . As I was saying , we 've had no contact with flight 401 today whatsoever . But you will indeed , continue to try and make contact ? Sure , all day . In fact we 've been in touch with people in Bedford Falls who Are indeed , putting together a search team to see If they can indeed find Duke . See if he 's gone down . And what about passengers ? No , unfortunately Duke was n't very good with passenger Flight records and things . I see . Well that seems to be the story here at Leelanau air tower . So for BDFD TV 3 , Action News , this is Have Lindquist . Back to you , Jerry . Thank you , Harve . Terrible situation . What ? What happened ? I was just watching him and he just stopped breathing . I mean , what are we going to do with him , Pete ? I do n't know . I wish those guys were back with some answers . We are n't going to bury him , are we ? I mean , I ca n't bury my best friend . He was my friend too . We ca n't just leave him here . He 'll start to smell . Maybe we could put him in a box and set it outside . Cold air will freeze him until we get back to town . Hey , no way , man . There 's no way I 'm putting my best friend in some pine box . Well , what do you want to do ? Let him sit here and lose all his body Fluids all over the floor and stink up the entire cabin ? Making us all sick until we 're outta here ? Well I do n't . We got to get it out of here . It gives me the creeps .  I ca n't do this . I know I got ta but I just ca n't . Nick , it 's OK . Nick . I know you guys were close . Listen , I 'll finish up . Why do n't you go outside and get some fresh air .   You let a dead man die ? What do you mean , the plane 's crashed ? It 's simple . The plane crashed . Well , where 's Tony and Gary ? Tony went to look for the plane 's radio . When he did n't come back , Gary went to look for Tony . We got ta get out of here . What are you going to do ? Walk across the ice ? Somebody 's going to have to . Are you crazy , man ? That 's at least a couple of miles . Peter . You all right , man ? Who is this ? Look out . God , there 's another one ! By your feet . There 's another one !  Get up !  Get it ! Get it now ! Get it ! Shoot it , man ! Get him ! Get him !  Holy shit ! Come on , guys . We got ta figure out what 's going on . What do you mean , Pete ? It was her those things are after . She 's probably the one with the answers . Well , we can play 20 questions later . Right now we got important stuff to do . You 're not going across the ice ? Well how do you propose we get off the island ? Wait until the spring thaw , and swim ? Send her across the ice . And let her take those damn little monster with her . She 's the one that brought them . Listen , we got ... He 's right . They are after me . And I 've got to stop the Wendigo before it can stop me . Oh , not the Hoodigo again . Somewhere on the island is the gate That connects the two worlds . The gate has been opened and I 've Got to find it and close it . She 's serious . Dead serious . I need your help . You guys know the island better than I do . Well , maybe you two guys can help her . But right now I got ta get going before it gets too dark . No . Please do n't . It 's no use . Help me get this thing . Help me find the circle . I 'm sorry . But I ca n't count on what you 're saying . It just does n't make sense . Nothing makes sense . I 've got ta go with the only logical means That I can think of getting off this island And that 's getting across that lake . And getting some help . He 's right . He 's wrong . No , it 's not . Sorry . I ca n't believe it . Tony 's dead . And better yet , somebody on this island killed him . Choked him to death . If I catch that deranged lunatic that Did this , as if it 's not bad enough around here , all ready . Hey ! Hey , you . Hello , friend . Look , pal , do n't friend me . What do you know about that plane crash over there ? And what do you know about that guy next to the plane With a major ring around his collar ? I do n't know about no plane crash And I do n't know about the guy with the dirty shirt . Wise guy , hey ? I bet you 're the one that axed him . I ought to finish you right here . Wait a minute . Axed him ? I do n't what you 're talking about . I get it . Playing innocent , huh ? Let me see your hands . You 're coming with me . Come on , pal . You look too suspicious . Look here , pal , I 'm getting a little bit suspicious of you Too , and I 'm tired of this , all right ? Me ? No look , I have n't done anything . I mean , sure I offed the old guy . But it was an accident , an accident . Ai n't you ever done anything by mistake ? Anyways , how am I supposed to know the old coot 's A keeper for some giant dog from hell ? How am I supposed to know ? You know what I mean ? Sure , monsters in the chili , people Catching on fire , some God damn giant monster in the woods . Sure , blame me . That 's it . Blame me . See , I 'm a scapegoat . I 'm nothing but a scapegoat . And now ...  Snap out of it , man . You ought to see a doctor . I am a doctor . Listen to me . You better take my advice and get out of here .

Love you too , daughter . I 'm not your daughter ! We will defeat you . We will defeat you .  I 'm melting ! I 'm melting . I 'm melting .  Listen , listen . The thing does n't howl , does it ? I do n't know . The Hoodigo Wendigo gets nothing out from me . Come on , Nick . Nick , come on . Nick , come on . Come on . Tony was dead . Somebody had crushed his neck . Where you going ? I 've got ta find the circle . What ? The only way to stop the Wendigo Is to close the sacred circle . I know what it is and where it is too . So you mean you 're the one those things are after . You got ta take me there . And we got ta go now . It 's all making sense . You 're the one .  Where 's the circle ? On the other side of the island .  It 's a couple miles . It 's a circle . Let 's go .  Gary , Wake up . What is it ? What kind of circle ? It 's a circle of skulls . But I broke it .    Sandy ! What are you doing ? Falling . Gary , help me !  Help me ! Help !  Put me down ! I ca n't get warm . You 've lost control of your body temperature . It only makes it harder to bring up . You 're suffering from hypothermia . I 'm cold . Relax No . No . Slow your breathing . Shh . Slow your breathing . No . Warm up . Please . Warm up .   No ! Sandy . It broke my arms .  My arms of ice . Now look . Look into my eyes .  Eyes of the Wendigo .       You OK ? We 've got to leave . Every minute we wait , the Wendigo grows . We 've got to hurry . We might be too late already . What the hell is going on out there ? Those are my friends . They 're not anymore . They 're just as much the Wendigo as the Wendigo itself . It controls their bodies . They crave human flesh . They 're cannibals .  Gary ! Burn ! Let 's go . You got ta help me . I tried to get away . It did n't help . No , not away . And I 'm afraid we have to do it before morning . Before morning ? It 's almost morning now . I can feel the Wendigo 's power growing . By morning , he 'll be free of the circle , free to move and grow . Well , what 's that supposed to mean ? Armageddon . Wendigo will start small . Then death will rise . Then demons will emerge from the bowels of the earth . Do n't shoot us , Peter . We ca n't help what happened . We ca n't help what we crave . We 're victims . Just like you . Do n't shoot me . Do n't shoot . We 're your friends . We 're your God damn friends . We 're your friends .  Let 's go .    What is it ? It happened . The gate has been opened . The Wendigo is at full strength . I seem to be losing mine . That 's it . That 's the circle . Where ? In there .   We ca n't go in there . What about that thing ?  He ca n't touch me . No ! Sandy ! Do n't go in there ! Come back ! Do n't !   Hey , you ugly son of a bitch ! Over here ! Whoa !   She defeated you . No . No .  OTHER WORLDLY VOICE : No , She has defeated you . The gate to your world is closing . Go with it . The battle is over . Then you will die . Sandy . You must join me . I can not stop it . Stand up . Sandy . You have the power . Join me . We must stop the Wendigo .   Do n't be afraid . Never be afraid . You have defeated the evil and you are free to go for now . But remember , the Wendigo 's spirit only rests . And there may come a day when you area called upon again .  @

They had four of those cans . I do n't know who got the other three , - I do n't know who could afford ' em . - It 's good pie . If it pleases you , we might have a postprandial recital . Okay , what ? - A bit of music . - I like music . ? On the distant prairie , where the heather wild , In its quiet beauty liv 'd and smiled , Stands a little cottage , and a creeping vine , Loves around its porch to twine . In that peaceful dwelling was a lovely child , With her blue eyes beaming soft and mild . And the wavy ringlets of her flaxen hair , Floating in the summer air . Everyone who knew her felt the gentle power . Of Rosalie , " The Prairie Flower . " That sure was pretty singing ' , Miss Cuddy . - I got some cheese . - Cheese ? Yes , Ma'am , you know I 've got a few of your sheep now . I know . Well , I made some cheese outta their milk . I wonder if you 'd like to have some . I 've got some here in my pocket . The cheese would be a fine finish to our fried chicken dinner and peach pie this evening . Well then , here it is . This is fine cheese , Bob . So why not marry ? Do what ? Why not throw in together , land , animals , implement , lives , the whole ball of wax ? We could use my capital and know-how to improve your claim and mine . And if the union produces children , so much the better . Looked at from any angle , it works . Please , Mr . Giffen , I wo n't take " No . " for an answer . Miss Cuddy ... I appreciate the offer and the supper , and the concert and all ... but I can not marry you . Will not . Wo n't . I ai n't perfect , but you are too bossy . And too plum-damned plain .

To what do I owe this pleasure , Reverend ? Springtime , Miss Cuddy . Are Clydene and the kids getting along all right ? Meaner than ever and growing by the minute . Put your mule up and come on inside the house . There 's been some trouble amongst the women here abouts . I 've heard about it . It 's bad . Guess what I 'm ordering . - I couldn't . - A Melodeon . - You are not ! - Yep , I do n't trust shipping a piano ... so , soon as I get into Loup I 'm gon na order a Mason Hamlin Melodeon . You 'll have the only Melodeon in the Territory . Back home I used to play the piano by the hour . I ca n't live without real music much longer . - I could help you with them dishes . - I do n't want any help with the dishes . So ... He helps me with my corn . We planted some potatoes together and we keep the fences up . How you getting along ? When my bulls have finished their work here , I let him turn it turn up on his heifers . Well ... Seems like you are getting along together all right . These are by dTStTP   ' When I get to Africa we 'll get it on because we do n't get along ! ' I 'm gon na eat him up ! Too much speed for him ! Too fast ! Too fast ! I 'm gon na retire the heavyweight champion of the world ! I 'm gon na retire the heavyweight champion ! September 25th the world 'll be stunned !  Tell ' em , Ali ! ' It wo n't be an easy fight but my plan of attack on a fighter like Alex Miteff would be two fast left jabs , a rapid right cross and a left hook .  ' But in the Belgian Congo , ' freedom was followed by rioting and an army mutiny . ' For months , the political pattern kept changing ' until pro-Red Premier Lumumba was seized ' by the forces of strongman Colonel Mobutu . '  After watching Mike DeJohn and Eddie Machen , I would rate myself number two . I 'm out to break Floyd Patterson 's record and this being my 20th birthday , today , January 17th , that leaves me exactly one year to reach my goal . I knocked out Don Warner and I just annihilated George Logan in four rounds .  ' Close your mouth and keep it closed . ' - That 's impossible . - Keep it closed . I 'm the greatest and I 'm knocking out all bums . And if you get too smart I 'll knock you out .  ' You 'd take him on before the fight ? ' Beat him like I 'm his daddy . I saw Sonny Liston a few days ago . Ai n't he ugly ? I 'm young , I 'm handsome , I 'm fast , I 'm pretty and ca n't possibly be beat .  Cassius Clay goes into the record book with Corbett , Tunney and Braddock , bringing off another great upset in heavyweight history . He was gon na kill me ! But he hit harder than George . His reach is longer , he 's a better boxer and I 'm better now than when you saw that kid running from Sonny Liston . I 'm experienced now , professional . Jaw 's been broke , been knocked down a couple of times , I 'm bad ! Been chopping trees , I done something new . - I wrestled with an alligator . -  That 's right , I have wrestled with an alligator ! I tussled with a whale . I handcuffed lightning , thrown thunder in jail ! That 's bad ! Only last week I murdered a rock ! Injured a stone ! Hospitalised a brick ! - I 'm so mean I make medicine sick ! - Bad dude ! Bad , fast ! Fast ! Fast ! Last night , cut the light off in my bedroom , hit the switch and was in the bed before the room was dark ! - Incredible . - Fast ! All of you ! I know you got him picked but the man 's in trouble ! I 'm gon na show you how great I am ! I think Ali was scared . I think he was scared even then . He knew he was gon na be very scared as he got closer to the fight . You know the way George fights . George comes out ... " I made him the mummy ! "  ' With his ego he could tell himself he would dominate Foreman , ' make a fool of him , that Foreman would never lay a glove on him . ' But in fact , in his sleep or wherever his private moment came he knew that he had not done as well against two fighters particularly , Joe Frazier and Ken Norton , whom Foreman had demolished .  Down goes Frazier ! Down goes Frazier ! The heavyweight champion is taking the mandatory eight count and Foreman is as poised as can be ! ' Foreman won by knocking Joe Frazier out ' and knocked him down something like seven times . ' Then he destroyed Ken Norton in two rounds . ' The word " murderous " does not quite apply , Foreman was awesome . ' This chump has got everybody scared . Scared of what ? There 's nothing to be scared of . Scared of what ? How many fellas in here picks George ? Be truthful , be men . Tell the truth . - John , raise your hand . -  Got George ? You got George . Tell the truth . You ! You , fella . Yeah . No pick ? I just wan na know . You got George ... The time may have come to say goodbye to Muhammad Ali , because very honestly I do n't think he can beat George Foreman . Howard Cosell , you told everybody I do n't have a chance . Told ' em I do n't have nothing but a prayer . Maybe he can pull off a miracle , but against George Foreman ? So young , so strong , so fearless ? Against George Foreman , who does away with his opponents one after another in less than three rounds ? It 's hard for me to conjure with that . You always say " Muhammad , you 're not the same man you were 10 years ago . " I asked your wife and she told me you 're not the same man you was two years ago ! After this fight I suspect Ali will retire . And through all of the years my own memories of him will be as a fighter , and as the strange and curious and gregarious and engaging and sometimes cruel , and sometimes family man that he is . I 'm gon na let everybody know that that thing on your head is a phoney and it comes from the tail of a pony . A stolen bicycle . So when he came out someone had stolen it and he went inside and he was crying and he told the policeman there , his name was Joe Martin , that someone stole his bike . And Joe Martin , he also taught the little boys how to box in the evening so he asked would he be interested in learning how to box and he told him yes , because if he ever found out who stole his bike he wanted to know how to fight so he could beat them up .  An overhand right sends Sonny to the canvas ! Referee Jersey Joe Walcott is trying to get Ali to a neutral corner . Ali yelling at Liston to get up ... - Anchor punch . - Which fight ? I call it the anchor punch . - The one Stepin Fetchit helped with ? - Yeah , man . When people win a ski race they say one and 16100ths , one and 32100ths of a second , so you break a second into 100 pieces so , you know ... that 's quick , they got a machine that goes , like , fr-r-t , real quick , fr-r-t , and it counts real quick , real quick . And by the time that thing hit four that 's how quick , from the time the punch started to where it landed was 4100ths of a second , an eye blink , like a camera flash . That 's 4100ths of a second . When I hit Sonny Liston all those people blinked , so they did n't see it . -  - I swear !  If you watch the film close , keep your eyes real close ... -  - Keep looking . I 'm getting ready to hit him . You got to hold your eyes and wait or you wo n't see it , man ! Ali was a beautiful ... And was whuppin ' ass too .  ' Deposed champion Cassius Clay , at court in Houston , ' is found guilty of violating Selective Service laws ' by refusing to be inducted . ' He is sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000 . '  ' The way he fused politics and sports . ' Very few Black athletes had ever talked the way Muhammad Ali talked ' without fear of something happening to their careers . '  ' .. as a Moslem minister made him exempt ... '  ' He was already very unpopular with mainstream Americans ' because he had joined the Nation of Islam , ' which was perceived as a radical Black separatist group . ' On top of that , when he was called for induction he refused to take the step forward . He absolutely infuriated America . Muhammad Ali said , " No Viet Cong ever called me nigger . This is God 's act and you 're part of it . This is no Hollywood set , this is real . Hollywood set up these scenes , have somebody in the movies playing his life . We do n't pick up a script . We get up in the morning , sometimes we feel good , sometimes bad , but we go through it with feeling . ' Muhammad Ali 's a prophet , he gon na be a fisherman for Elijah Muhammad . ' This is only a stop , look and listen sign he 's doing , fighting . ' We been fightin ' ever since we met . We beat Uncle Sam , come out of the garage and beat number two . First man ever did it . Rest of ' em they put out of the country . ' This is God 's act , we just actors in it . ' If Jesus was here everybody 'd want his autograph ' and they 'd be filming him . How you gon na beat God 's son ? Anybody who loves poor people and little people got ta be a prophet . He was champion of the world , had a table full of food . Had a house for his mother , one for him and he told ' em to shove it . If he could n't love his god , what do you think he is ... mister ?    ' Ali trained for the Foreman fight at Deer Lake , Pennsylvania . ' He trained very hard for that fight , ' and had very good sparring partners . ' Larry Holmes was one of them . ' I was struck with how well he actually handled Ali ' in their sparring sessions . ' He dominated Ali . That was n't uncommon . ' Ali would often not show his best stuff with sparring partners , ' but would work on his weaknesses . '  ' This is in Africa because they came up with $10 million . ' $5 million for George Foreman , $5 million for me . England was trying to get it . A promoter said America was trying , but none could surpass the $5 million mark . The dream is becoming a reality .  ' Don King went to George Foreman ' and got him to sign an agreement ' saying that if King could deliver $5 million , Foreman would fight Ali . ' Then King went to Ali and made the same deal , ' so Don King now had both fighters , ' their signatures on a piece of paper . ' What he did n't have was $10 million . ' .. a festival to complement this great sporting event , the greatest sporting event in history . - Of all time ! - All time , as the champ says . The president of Zaire was willing to put $10 million of his country 's own very scarce , hard-earned currency on the line , not for any short-term economic reason but because he felt that the fight would be good in terms of promoting Zaire and also in terms of promoting himself , and as Ali said at the time , countries go to war to get their names on the map and wars cost a lot more than $10 million .  Some of the most dynamic performers from Afro-America will appear at the stadium in Kinshasa on the 20th , 21st and 22nd , with this theatrical release . It will be James Brown , soul brother number one ... - Is he playing ? - Yes , James Brown will be there . We will have BB King , The Spinners ... Plus I got ta whup George ! ' Got to whup George ! ' We 're gon na rumble in the jungle ! Come on , come on . Speak up , boy . Go ahead . -  - Good boy . Get down . - Quiet . - George ? Is this fight against Ali the toughest of your career ?  Could be , could be . I doubt it . This is Muhammad Ali , September 10th at New York City airport , en route to Zaire to reclaim the heavyweight title of the world . Champ , what would you like to say to the children of the world ? I 'd like to say , mainly where they understand English in America , to ... live a clean life , stay off the dope . It 's tearing the country up . Also , if they wan na be like me , I 'm going to whup George Foreman , and when they see this I will have beaten him . Eat natural foods because we must whup Mr Tooth Decay . I got one right there and one there . Ali told us he 's going to use part of his money to build a hospital . Do you intend to use part of your money for something , a project ? He may think he may have to be in the hospital . I want the man ! When I get to Africa we gon na get it on because we do n't get along ! I do n't like him , he talks too much . - Beg your pardon ? - You would continue boxing - even if you lose ? - I beg your pardon ? -  - You do n't think about losing ? No . But thank you . Nice talking to you .  Flying over the Sahara desert . An African airline with all African stewardesses , all African pilots . Ai n't this something , flying in an airplane with Black pilots ? All Black crew ? This is strange to the American Negro . We never dreamed of this ! Every time we watch TV they show us Tarzan and the natives and jungles , they never told us that Africans were more intelligent than we are . They speak English , French and African . We ca n't even speak English good .  Ai n't this beautiful ? I 'm free !  Fantastic ! I 'm free . # Now , I want everybody # To repeat after me # If you do n't know who you are and where your place in life is # Just say to yourself , I am ! # Somebody ! # I am ! # Somebody ! # I may be poor # But I am somebody #  ' It was a great joy ' to see that the championship was going to happen in Africa . ' People were so happy . ' When we saw that America was at war with a Third World country , Vietnam , ' and that one of the children of the United States said ' " Me ? You want me to go and fight against the Viet Cong ? " ' " Why should I fight against them ? They have n't hurt me . " ' And for us , it was extraordinary to see that in the America of that time ' someone could take such a position . ' He may have lost his title , he may have lost millions of dollars ' but he gained the esteem of millions of Africans . '  Ali ! Ali ! Ali ! What is your population ?  - 22 million . - 22 million ? - 22 million . - How many George Foreman fans here ?  -  - We do n't know , we do n't know . ' We thought he was white , then we realised he was black , like Ali . ' But still , for us , Foreman represented America . ' He arrived with a dog , a German shepherd , ' which immediately offended Africans ' since the Belgians had used them as police dogs . '  Ali said you 're the out-of-towner here . Africa is the cradle of civilisation , everybody 's home is Africa .  OK , fine . So , they 're leaving tomorrow ... Typhoid . How do you spell typhoid ? Is that all that we 're giving ?  Who do you want to be your beneficiary in case of anything ?  ' You need a ticket to get on the plane . ' Let me see some hands of the 51 who do n't have airline tickets . Hi ! Zai-ere , or Zare , or whatever , you know ? Yeah , when are gon na get to Zee-air ? - Who ? - Mobutu land . We 're gon na fly in zee-air till we get to Zaire . That 's right ! # Tell someone to meet me # I got it , look here ! # The plane is not coming in at six , it 's now coming in between 10 and 11 , so you do n't have to have those trucks up to the airport that early . -  Where 's James Brown ... ? - James Brown is on his way . BB King ... They ai n't nowhere around ! Six , fifth and fourth are done . Elevators are working . There 's no air conditioning at all ? 80% 's out . The circuits are in but it does n't work ... It 's individual air conditioning controls ... What apartments have air conditioning ? How many beds can we move people into tonight ? - Four . Four rooms . - Just eight people ? Yeah . # Everything gon na be all right # Cos home 's where the heart 's at , yeah # And it 's a natural fact # What you sayin ' tell me , wo n't you ? # Yeah , hey hey # Got ta make a start today # Got ta do it in my way # Gon na see Momma again # Gon na see my old , old friend # Africa ! # Africa ! # Africa ! # Ohh , Africa ! # Hello , bubba ! How you doin ' ? Ready to dance ? I got ants in my pants , I got ta dance . ' The fight was held in Zaire , the former Belgian Congo . ' Kinshasa was the capital on the banks of the Congo , ' this was just before the rainy season . The Congo had such a wonderful name , Conradian and all that . To call it Zaire did n't have quite the majesty , but there it was , the Congo .  ' Mobutu was everywhere . ' He was the equivalent of Stalin . ' ' You saw his picture everywhere . ' Part of the vanity of dictators , with the exception of Mussolini , who was half ugly and half attractive , most dictators are unbelievably ugly or plain - Franco , Hitler ... ' Mobutu looked the archetype , the epitome of a closet sadist . ' Sort of guy , if you meet him in a bar , you think , " Oh , my God ! ' Before the fight came , the criminal rate in Zaire began to go up . ' A few white foreigners had been killed , driving their cars . And Mobutu decided that this would be a disaster in terms of publicity , so on a given day he had a thousand of the leading criminals in Kinshasa rounded up and put in this stadium , down in the detention pens . ' And then the legend has it , and I suspect the legend may even be true , ' that he had 100 taken at random and killed them . ' And the reason was a particularly simple one ' from Mobutu 's point of view . ' Career criminals have connections who protect them when they 're in trouble , and by making this kill of 100 out of 1,000 arbitrarily , Mobutu was saying " Your connections are worth nothing . I am Jehovah . ' " I will blast you out of existence if you fool around with me . '  ' To me , the drum was the communicator since the beginning of time , ' I 'm sure it was the first message ever sent . ' The beat today and the beats centuries ago ' are the only thing that 's kept us together . ' We had this thing , when we hurt , we sung for trial and tribulation , and for relief , we sung songs to God and this music that you hear today is the same songs that have been made popular around the world without any volition . Oh ! ' So anybody who knows anything ' about the rhythm and the blues as they 're so-called , ' should know about Africa ... Your woman does n't leave you and slip away like our women , because you had money to keep your woman . Your songs are like , " And the train comes around that mountain , " In the Folsom Prison , in the Folsom Prison " . You know , " Y'all come , y'all come . " Chinese got diddly music , " Pleen ting tang tong ting . " I do n't want that and he understands . Everybody 's got their culture . So we 're not saying we hate you or we 're never talking to you again and doing business , we do n't do that . We 're saying that we want to be independent . ' That was where we saw Foreman , who seemed incredible . ' I 'd seen him fight before , I saw him destroy Frazier and the thing I always remembered was that the beaten fighter , even a man as powerful and big as Frazier , and he was very much favoured to win that , suddenly becomes the size of a pygmy . They just diminish in size , and Foreman suddenly became this gigantic figure . ' And he had a trainer , Dick Sadler , tiny by comparison , ' and Sadler would hang on to this heavy bag while Foreman would hit it . ' Sadler would have been picked off his feet . '  ' Foreman hitting the bag ' is one of the more prodigious sights I 've had in my life . ' Of all the people I 've seen hit heavy bags , including Sonny Liston , ' no one hit it the way Foreman did . ' What would be interesting is Ali , who would train after Foreman , ' would pass this large hall where the training took place ' and he never looked at Foreman hitting the heavy bag . ' He just walked right by as if Foreman did n't exist . ' If you were gon na fight the man ' you did n't want to see him hitting that heavy bag . ' I 'm a speed demon ! I 'm a brain fighter ! I 'm scientific ! I 'm artistic ! I plan my strategy ! He 's the bull , I 'm the matador ! He 's scared to death . He 's scared to death ! He wish he could get out of the whole thing ! He wish he could get out of the whole thing ! The man is frightened ! He 's meetin ' his master , his teacher , his idol ! - Time !  ' Ali announced he was gon na dance . ' He spoke about it all the time . ' Every interview in that period he 'd say ' " How is Foreman going to get near to me ? I 'm going to dance ! ' " I 'm going to dance and dance ! He 'll look foolish trying to find me . ' " And as he gropes his way forward " in this storm of blindness at the speed of my dancing " I will strike him with my jab ! " Poo ! Poo ! Poo ! " he would go and so forth . We heard this over and over and Foreman heard it too . ' Foreman was working now on what 's called cutting off the ring . ' This essentially just means ' cornering your opponent against the ropes or in a corner . ' It 's an art , a balletic art , you have to have very good footwork . ' He worked with very fast fighters , ' smaller than himself , who certainly could dance ' and he worked on cornering them . ' And the combination of watching the heavy bag ' and watching Foreman cut off the ring ' made most fight writers , myself included , ' pessimistic about Ali 's chances . ' The guy threw up his elbows to protect himself from Foreman and Foreman walked into his elbow . That 's how he got cut in the eye ? What else can happen ? I saw the man 's cut and this man can not fight . This man can not fight for a world championship ... - You 're not a doctor . - I do n't give a damn . I know what ... The Zaireans kicked us out and they did not want us around , and they want the fight to go on , that 's all there is to it . He wo n't fight with that eye , he 's not dumb . Excuse me , gentlemen . I respectfully ask are the fighters remaining here because they want to or has the government requested they remain ? Mr Sadler told me to convey to the press that it is just an accident . They will be contacting the promoters of the fight and it is possible that we may have to delay the fight and he will let the press know as soon as possible . Did they have to stitch Foreman ? They had to stitch him . Holy shit , man . So how long is the delay ? It 'll take a day to get any intelligence , this just happened . Then we can make a decision .  How does George feel ? Like anybody , he 's only human . I 'm not that intelligent , I do n't have that knowledge , that ability to speak another man 's mind . He never discussed it to me , and a person 's mind change from time to time . - The decision is yours ... - It is mine to make and I have n't made any ... I do n't have any decisions to make .  Let 's get this show on the road . This meeting is called to order . Here , here . The delay wo n't have any effect on the fight at all . There has n't been ... there will not be a delay . The fight will be rescheduled but when it happens it 'll be actually intended for that time . Fate intended it for another time . There is no delay .  ' Muhammad went through a bad couple of hours ' and wanted to move the whole fight back to the United States , ' then he said " Bring Joe Frazier over and I 'll fight him again ' " and instead of each of us getting $5 million , ' " I 'll take $3 million and Joe can take $1 million . " ' Then he realised nothing could be done about it ' except stay in Zaire an extra six weeks and make the best of it . ' Now I got ta wait . He 'll get his whupping but I just have to wait . Boy , I was ready ! I was gon na upset the world again ! The whole world was gon na crawl and bow the next morning ! I was gon na defeat that big indestructible George Foreman , gon na rip him up ! I 'm gon na get him for a sparring partner . My dream 's all messed up for six more weeks . -  He 's in my country . You wan na see some of my country ? Ali , boma ye !  Ali , boma ye ! Ali , boma ye ! Can you picture 100,000 ? Can you picture 100,000 ? How you say it ? Ali , boma ye , Ali , boma ye ! Ali , boma ye ! When I hear them brothers howling like that , whoo ! I get my soul and spirit , 100,000 African brothers hollering " Ali , boma ye ! " And I 'm gon na ... Ooh ! I 'm tired , ca n't take it no more , let me get out of here . I wan na ... I 'm going to my room , I 'll talk to you later . I said I 'm gone ! # What you give me # When I miss you , baby ! # Oh , man ! # Baby , you understand ? # I 'll be good ! # In a cold sweat # Ow ! ' I heard a speech by Jesse Jackson , saying we must recognise that we 're only useful as long as we 're necessary . So they do n't realise that your strength comes from your community .  And you have to deal from your strength . In dealing from your strength you got somebody so if somebody wants to hurt James Brown , somebody gon na raise a voice and say " why ? " You got soldiers , somebody that 's concerned . But as an individual , no matter how big you get , you still a nigger . You do n't care how much money you get . You are still a nigger . When you become unnecessary . # Listen # Extend your love # Can I get a drum ? # Can I get a little taste ? # Do unto others as you would have them to do unto you . And I do n't have to use the word " FM " backwards .  We left Africa in shackles , fetters and chains . We 're coming back in an aura of splendour and glory . The champions are here , champions of the sports world and the music world , so put ' em together and we got one champion that 's so intermingled that we 're fused into one entity . The brother said something there ! Yeah ! Don King put this together . It was not a colour put it together , you understand ? I 'd like to call him the Messiah .  ' This fight came into existence ' because of Don King 's desire to break out of the pack . ' Oh , I 'm so happy to see you , my brothers . This is the Minister of Finance of Zaire . Yes , I have met the Minister of Finance . How are you ? I appreciate your talent and expertise . This is what it 's all about . I welcome you with love . We must deal with it as such , but with love , not with hostility . You know , just but with love . Bravo , Mr King ! My brother !  ' King had this huge air of welcome . ' Rarely has anyone ever been welcomed the way King could do it . ' ' A joy came off him . ' I knew his reputation , how he 'd been in jail , how he was thoroughly untrustworthy but nonetheless he made you feel good . Do n't leave ! I need your strength ! He was startling looking . Writers found different ways to describe this uprush of hair .  ' The fight was postponed . ' Don King turned up and it seemed maybe the fight would n't happen . ' Nothing as big as this ever runs smoothly , anything worthwhile is worth fighting for . If you think about what Shakespeare said , " the sweet uses of adversity , " ugly and venomous like a toad yet wears a precious jewel in his head . " " Ugly and venomous like a toad yet wears a precious jewel . " How many fight promoters have tried even one line of Shakespeare ? I can relate to the denial they are confronted with , the rat-infested hovels , sub-standard tenements , overcrowded tenements . I 've been a part of it . I know about roaches and rats . When he started talkin ' to me I can understand him and he can understand me . So , when I do this here he can understand . What would happen if you took a small part of the vast sums of money being made from the fight and put it into something that was ... that would help a number of people rather than a few ? This is my dream and desire , and I feel that I would need ... white counterparts to do this here . I would say let me engender a large amount of money , if it 's possible , and then do n't just let the money sit there and wither away and die but put it into the sun so it could germinate , blossom and grow .  ' He 's a remarkable man . ' Don King is one of the brightest people I 've ever met , ' he 's one of the most charismatic people I 've ever met , ' he 's one of the hardest working people I 've ever met . And nobody does anything for nothing . You understand that ? Fight or no fight , what business are we in ? - Music ! - I was starting to wonder . I felt like we 've been in the fight business . # My body # My body # Shake your body # Shake your body # Shake your body # We 're gon na have a funky good time # We 're gon na have a funky good time # We 're gon na have a funky good time # We 're gon na have a funky good time # We 're gon na have a funky good time # We 're gon na have a funky good time # Pick ' em up ! # We 're gon na take you high , yeah ! # I 'm gon na play me some soul music , man . The Spinners ... to James Brown . - # Make me high - # Get me high - # Make me high - # Get me high - # A natural high - # Groovy high ... #  Ali !

Sucker , you ai n't nothin ' ! You 're too ugly ! You do n't represent us coloured folks . These Africans make all of us ugly . Sucker , look at you ! Ali , boma ye ! Ali , boma ye ! That mean kill him !  When I walk down the street kids follow me screaming " George Foreman , bumba yu " er , " boma ye " , yeah . And that has n't ... I do n't think that 's so nice . I 'd like , if they have anything to say about me they could say " George Foreman loves Africa " or " George Foreman loves being here " not " George Foreman , kill him , " I do n't like that .  Boma ye !  Boma ye !  George Foreman .  Boma ye ! Boma ye !  - There he is ! - Boma ye ! Sucker , you was n't nothing ! Even they understand English .  ' We were all for Muhammad Ali . ' Foreman ? We did n't know him . ' Muhammad Ali could have been even lighter-skinned ' but for us he was defending the good cause , ' for Africans and the whole world . ' Watch this , seven punches . I 'm gon na fight for the prestige , not for me but to uplift my little brothers who are sleeping on concrete floors today in America . Black people living on welfare , who ca n't eat , Black people who do n't know no knowledge of themselves or no future . I wan na win my title and walk down the alleys with the wine-heads , walk with the dope addicts , the prostitutes . " They never knew you was over here . " God is blessing me and it was an accident to help get to all these people and show them films I have n't seen ! I 'm well and I have n't seem them ! Now I can get all these films , you governments can let me take pictures and I can take all this back to America ! But - it 's good to be a winner , all I 've got to do is whup Foreman . I realise how unfortunate and uncomfortable it is for you guys to have travelled so far and expecting so much and getting so little .  ' George Foreman was a phenomenon . ' He was almost like a physical guru . ' He almost never spoke but it was always arresting . ' You never quite knew what he meant , it might be deep or non-responsive . ' He was Negritude . He was this huge Black force . Now when I go in the ring , you see what kind of mind I got now ? Oh ! Oh ! I just got to pound him . I 'm not gon na even realise ... I might look at his face and say , " How 'd I do that ? " Allah , God , I 'm his tool . God got in me on purpose for my people . God has made this man look like a little kid . His so-called right hand ai n't nothing now , I do n't even feel ' em ! I walk right in and take my shots because I have God in my mind . I 'm thinking of my people being free and I can help with just one fight . He looks little in comparison to what I 'm getting from it ! But if I think about just me ... George Foreman knocked out Joe Frazier like he was God . He knocked out Ken Norton . But my God controls the universe .  ' I was interested in people called " f ? ticheurs " . ' They are witches , soothsayers , ' and in Western Africa almost everybody has one . ' They go to a witch doctor the way we would go to a dentist . ' Muhammad Ali had been to Mobutu 's f ? ticheur . And ... He had said that ... The f ? ticheur had said that a woman with trembling hands would somehow get to Foreman . A succubus . ' And that impressed me enormously . '   ' The heavyweight championship produces an excitement ' that 's unlike almost any other spectacle . ' It 's almost physically unendurable ' to wait for that bell to ring for the first round . ' Ali 's dressing room was like a morgue . ' It was like The Last Supper . And at a certain point Ali said , " Why is everyone ... " so unhappy ? " What is the matter with all of you ? " The sense was that we were watching a man who was going out to be ... going out to the gallows . They all believed he was gon na get defeated and they were terrified . They thought that with his pride he would take one of the world 's worst beatings ever and he would n't give up . And he was gon na be destroyed . Killed or maimed , they knew not what . But they were deeply frightened , as if they were taking whatever fear Ali might have had and absorbing it . After a while he looked at Bundini and said , " We 're gon na dance tonight . " They said , " You 're gon na dance ! " They said , " Dance ! " He said , " Yes ! And that man 's gon na be bewildered ! " I 'm gon na dance and dance ! " And they said , " You 're gon na dance ! " I swear they were all crying . And he built them up to a degree so that for him they became half-happy .  Here comes the Ali people out of the dressing room and all of the questions will be answered . The awesome power of George Foreman against the varied boxing skills of Muhammad Ali . It 's age against youth . The experience of Muhammad Ali against the youth and brute force and blinding speed . You can hear the band strike up in the background as Ali moves to the ring . This is what Muhammad Ali lives for , this is the man 's life . This may be an historic event , Muhammad Ali coming into the boxing ring for the last time . Here comes the heavyweight champion of the world , George Foreman , jogging out ! George Foreman decked out in his red robes , coming in with his people .  ' No one in the press ever saw Mobutu ' and he did n't come to the fight . ' He watched the fight on closed circuit . ' It was the only one in Zaire . ' He was terribly afraid of assassination . ' This stadium was a true arena for gladiators . ' The floor you could not see beneath the floor was covered with blood . ' That blood had been washed away but the effect was still there . '  There was talk about the possibility of rain , I do n't think the weather could be any more beautiful than it is . Ali is getting the people to chant ! " Ali , boma ye , " that means " Ali , kill him . Really staring at each other . Foreman looking serious , Ali definitely talking . Look at the stare on Foreman . Look at Ali give him the word . The stage is set , we 're just about ready to begin round one . The championship is at stake and $5 million will be paid to both fighters . Ali ready , Foreman ready , we 're waiting for the bell . Here we go , Ali quickly across the ring . Round one , Ali bouncing around , shifting left to right . George moves slow , Ali gets the first punch in , a light right-hand taken on the forehead by the champion . Foreman moving slow , stalking . Ali looks like he 's ready to go here . He 's not staying away , he 's going after his man . Foreman cautious in the first round , looking to drop that left hook . Foreman 's locked his man to the far corner . Foreman dances ... Ali with a right-hand lead ! Has Foreman slightly confused with that right-hand lead , which I have n't seen too many times before . A right-hand lead , where you throw your right without countering , you throw it first , like a jab . That has to travel that extra distance across the shoulders . ' Professionals rarely use this because it 's so dangerous to throw ' since you are open to a left hook . ' Since fighters work in milliseconds ' they can see a right coming much faster than a jab . ' Nobody had thrown a right-hand lead at Foreman in two years , and none of his sparring partners , for $50 a day , was going to start throwing right-hand leads at him because it 's a great insult to a top professional . ' It suggests he 's slow enough that you can hit him with it . ' ' Instead Ali figured out Foreman 's not expecting a right-hand lead . ' He may have debated whether to up until the last moment . But he did n't knock Foreman down or knock him out . Instead , Foreman went crazy .  That punch did no damage . That one did ! Two wild right hands taken on the head of Ali ! A real strong right hand just underneath the heart . Ali is taking some punishment now ! Eight seconds left in the round . Bell rang . Ali went back to the corner ... Finally the nightmare he 'd been awaiting in the ring had finally come to visit him . ' He was in the ring with a man he could not dominate , ' who was stronger than him , who was not afraid of him , ' who 'd try to knock him out , and who punched harder than Ali , ' and this man was determined and unstoppable . ' Ali had a look on his face that I 'll never forget . ' Ali looked as if he looked into himself and said , " All right , this is the moment . " This is what you 've been waiting for . " This is ... that hour . " Do you have the guts ? " And he kind of nodded , like , " Really got to get it together , boy . " You are gon na get it together ... you WILL get it together . " He nodded some more , as if he were looking into the eyes of his maker , and then turned to the crowd and went " Ali , boma ye ! " and 100,000 people all yelled back " Ali , boma ye ! " And this huge reverberation of the crowd came back into the ring . ' Ali picked it up as if " these are my people , ' " this is what I 'm here for . ' " The time has come , I 'm gon na find a way to master this man .  ' Foreman , like everyone , had assumed that Ali would dance , ' and so Ali now went to the ropes and went into the Rope-a-Dope . ' And a lot of people thought that moment the fight was over . ' Especially on TV , it looked like Foreman was killing a very weak Ali . ' You do n't go to the ropes . And there he was , leaning way back . ' I wrote about it , like a man leaning out of his window ' trying to see if there 's something on his roof . ' And , you know , taking it . Here were these great broadsides and it looked like he was being set up for the kill . It happened so quickly and so abruptly , that I said , I shouted to Norman , " The fix is in . " ' He 's supposed to go down in the first or second . ' Ropes is halfway house to the floor .  ' They became so basic that they were like two kids fighting . ' ' For that round and the next round and the next round ' Ali lay against the ropes , and he kept talking to Foreman . ' It was extraordinary . ' You had to be close to see it . ' ' And Foreman was throwing these prodigious punches ' and Ali swung like a man in the rigging . ' He 'd go all the way back , he 'd slide out like that . Occasionally , he 'd get hit and he 'd say " George , you disappoint me . " You do n't hit as hard as I thought you would , George , " you 're not breaking popcorn ! " ' And Foreman 's insane with rage , ' wanging at him and wanging at him , ' powerful , powerful , powerful . ' And middle of the fifth round Foreman had punched himself out . ' It had taken three rounds . First good combination by Ali lands on the head of Foreman . Foreman with that right hook . Ali scores a hook ! Quick jab with the right backs up Foreman ! Backs him up in his tracks ! Foreman tries the hook ! Ali goes to the right ! Foreman gets knocked to the left ! Foreman hit again ! Foreman has been hit three or four times ! Ali came off the ropes and hit him a right and you can see the sweat pour off like a fountain off Foreman 's face and you suddenly realised there was design in this madness . So I turned to Norman , he was somewhat puzzled , but I said , " The succubus has got him ! " , referring to this woman with the trembling hands that the witch doctors had said would touch Foreman and destroy him .  .. Ali 's tactics , to let the man punch himself out . 30 seconds left in round eight . Very even fight . Ali a sneaky right hand . Two ... three ... Four ... five ... Foreman gets up to the knee at eight ! That 's it ! The fight is stopped ! Muhammad Ali with a dramatic eighth round knockout ! He knocks out ... George Foreman ! He 's done it ! Muhammad Ali has done it ! Muhammad Ali has ... Muhammad Ali . Muhammad Ali ...  ' Muhammad Ali , he was like a sleeping elephant . ' You can do whatever you want around a sleeping elephant , ' but when he wakes up ... he tramples everything . '  Muhammad Ali , boma ye . Boma ye . Muhammad Ali , boma ye George Foreman . He did it . ' He 's champion again , we could n't believe it . ' One has mixed emotions when you see the end of a fight . ' I always feel sympathy for the man losing it , ' particularly when you see a titanic , formidable figure ' suddenly on the ground . '  ' Now , when we see George on TV , ' and know that after that knockout ' he went through two years of the deepest depression , ' he almost did n't come out of it . ' To see the man who 's come out of it , ' the way he reconstructed his personality , ' it 's hard to find anyone in America more affable than George Foreman . ' Foreman has become a fabulous person in American life . ' Just as the fight finished , the monsoons , the African rains , came , and they came so hard that the waters were about three feet deep in the dressing rooms where we 'd just been an hour ago , I 'd never seen such a downpour .  ' He stayed up all night from what I heard , ' and in the morning he spoke to African groups who 'd come to see him , ' and they more than revered him , he was a god . ' And he spoke to them very simply and beautifully , ' and he said , " Afro-Americans , in America , ' " we 're not as good as you are . ' " Some of us are richer than you are , ' " but you have a dignity in your poverty that we do n't have . ' " We are spoiled in America , ' " we have lost what you still have in Africa and you must keep that . " ' And I thought , on top of everything else he 's a political leader ' and he 's gon na be a great political leader . Prostitution , dope , gang fights . Knowledge of self . Black people have no knowledge of themselves . We have been made just like white people mentally . White people have made us so much like them it 's hard to teach them about themselves , it 's hard to teach them to unite and marry and be with their own . Black people are now like white people , we have to re-brainwash ' em now , teach them about themselves and their history and language , to do something for themselves and quit begging white people for things they should do themselves . I never heard Ali say he would never fight again . If he had said it , and usually he told the truth , I would n't have believed it . He was born to fight , born for the ring and loved it , he truly loved fighting . And ... as happens with people who love a thing too much , it destroys them .  ' He came back , he had 22 fights . ' Some were most honourable , some very difficult . ' Some were comedies and farces . ' He hurt himself in those 22 fights after the fight in Africa . '  ' There is a tendency to look at Muhammad and say ' he 's wounded , he 's ill . ' There are no intellectual deficits , it 's a motor skills problem ' and he does n't try to hide his condition . ' He goes out and lets the whole world see it . ' He does n't feel sorry for himself ' and there 's really no reason for anybody else to feel sorry for him . ' He loves being Muhammad Ali , ' he truly believes that he 's doing God 's work ' and he 's as happy with each day as anybody I know . '  ' Today 's young generation , they do n't know anything . And it 's scary . ' They 're missing a lot if they do n't know the legacy of Muhammad Ali , ' because no matter what era you live in , ' you see very few true heroes . '  Ali , boma ye ! Ali , boma ye ! Ali , boma ye ! Ali , boma ye ! Back up , sucker , back up . Come get me , sucker , I 'm dancin ' ! I 'm dancin ' ! Follow me , chump ! I 'm not there , I 'm here ! Sucker , you ai n't got nothing !.. # Years after the fight in Zaire , perhaps ten years after , I 'd run into Ali on occasion after that , but I remember this meeting . Esquire was giving a party for various people who had distinguished themselves in Esquire that year . Ali , for whatever he 'd done , I was there probably because I had a good story in Esquire that year , maybe 25 of us , honoured guests , I was there with my wife and we saw Ali and we were talking with him and he could n't have been nicer . I remember I was 62 then , cos he said , " How old are you now ? " I said " 62 , " he said " Oh , " same as when we were jogging that night , " Oh , I hope I 'm as young as you are when I 'm 62 , " he went on like that . I got so pleased and so vain that , you know , I 'm like a dog . I went away and once I was gone he turned to my wife , who 's much younger than I am , and he looked at her hard and said , " You still with that old man ? " And for me that 's always been ... That 's Ali . You love him even when you turn your back on him . I heard him once talking to the Harvard senior class commencement . He gave this extraordinary speech , you know he was dyslexic , and he would look at a paper and say , " What does this word mean ? " I 'd say , " Appendicitis . " He 'd say , " How d' you get a word like appendicitis ? It 's so long . " Here he was delivering a lecture , senior class day with these 1,000 , 2,000 Harvard graduates , and ... he had these little cards in front of him . Then someone shouted out , " Give us a poem ! " And everybody quieted down . Now , the shortest poem according to Bartlett 's Quotations is called " On the Antiquity of Microbes " and the poem is " Adam had ' em . " Pretty short . But Muhammad Ali 's poem was " Me , we . " Two words . I wrote Bartlett 's Quotations and I said , " Look , that 's shorter . " It stands for something more than the poem itself . " Me , we . " What a fighter he was . And what a man . # Refugee cat ... Ali , boma ye # Yes , yes ... Rumble in the jungle # Come on ! # It be the God stricken , God nutrition , lightly stricken # Blow that make you feel like you was poison bitten # Ha ! The first change was in the eyes . The iris separated from the pupil and it followed movement like a motion detector . I 'd watch them hours on end and when they 'd see me , they 'd stare back , unblinking , unemotional . Sometimes I swear they were laughing at me . We did n't mean for things to go as far as they did , but in a world that 's mostly covered with water we needed a new kind of defense . Just another fish in the sea . But we made a horrible mistake . We meant to take the next step in evolution , but we created a monster .   -  - How do you make that sound ? It 's a family secret . But I can tell you it 's one of the reasons Mom 's had so many rich husbands . -  - Change your mind yet ? It 's not too late . We can forget about the whole thing . - Yeah , sure .  Let 's go .  Thank heavens for Home Depot .  - What about the power ? - It 's usually off . -  -    More government BS . Very professional . Crime runs in the family . Daddy 's a lawyer .   You know the drill : Swim out to the buoy and back . Could n't be any easier . The sign said the water 's polluted . Am I gon na get sick or something ? We all had to do it . Do we look sick ? Do you want to be a Delta Delta Chi or do n't you ? Ready ? I guess so . That 's the Delta Delta spirit !   You 're such a liar . We did n't have to do this . There 's something out here in the water ! Nice try ! I 'm not kidding ! I felt -- What 's she doing ? Screw it , let 's get out of here .  Oh God . This is the Military Police . You are trespassing on federal property . - Stay where you are . - If I get caught my dad 's gon na have a shit fit . - What are we supposed to do ? - Take the back way out . We ca n't just leave . What about my dad 's car ? Good evening . -  - Mel ! Mel ! Mel ? - Mel ? -  Oh God ! Help !  Mel ?  Grab my hand !  Grab it ! Grab it ! I 've got you !  Way to go , Doc ! You just tied the world record of 12 ringers in a row , held by none other than ... your-rr husban-nnd ! Yeah , your record 's about to go down in flames . He sounded serious .  As always , your timing is sublime . Correct me if I 'm wrong , did n't they invent something called an elevator about 100 years ago ? 1853 , to be exact . Why would you know that ? - It 's what you love about me . - Loved . And it still does n't explain why we ca n't use it . He thinks if we 're out of breath we wo n't argue with him so much . Is that it ? Where do you get that information ?  Morning , Dr . Collins , Dr . Collins . You wanted to see us ? I did n't have breakfast . - You know what this is ? - Our project . No . Not anymore . Over . - Over ? - You 're kidding . No no , let me rephrase that . I have three and a half hysterical girls in there . The divers are still trying to locate the rest of the fourth one . That does n't make any sense . Even if the sharks could breach the steel net -- Which they did . There is no way into this compound past the 6,000 volts going through the perimeter fence . Is there ? There have been budget shortfalls . We had to make up the difference somewhere . My God , you turned off the electric fence ? - Intermittently . - You did n't , Larry . How many times have I told you , Dr . Collins , my name is Lawrence ? I would n't have to make any cutbacks if you two had brought me some results that I could take to the oversight committee . What have you done for me lately ? Okay , we have managed to increase their speed . Ah-na-na ! I just want to know one thing : Are the subjects responding to commands ? May I ? All right , Doc . I 'm on it . Okay , there 's Avery now . It 's show time . He 's scared . I guess that 's a good thing .  Okay , here they come . My God ! Carcharodon carcharias can smell blood in dilutions of one part to 500 million parts of water . Killer schnozzes . They 're bigger than last time . Groucho , Harpo , Chico , Gummo , Zeppo . " The Sharks Brothers . " And here 's the baddest boy in class ... Red Dog . Okay , watch this . Avery ? -  - Marla : Now . You got it , Doc . That was you ? The monitoring implants in each shark are also transceivers . Does it work the other way around ? I mean , can the shark be signaled to attack ? Well , they are predators . I guess they could be trained -- The purpose of the Blue Demon Project was to create an undetectable defense system , not another weapon . Of course . I 'm just thinking out loud . Comfortable ? So it does n't work on all of them ? It 's 50-50 with Red Dog . We do n't know why . Let me get this straight . You 've spent four years and millions of dollars on this project and all I have to show for it are a couple of big sharks with pretty eyes ? 90 days ! I have a show-and-tell with the big brass . It 's a funding review , so that we can all keep our jobs ! I want concrete results , something that will hold water besides their lungs . It 's new science , it 's unstable . We have to examine it , understand it . Hmm . I 'm glad to see you two agree on something . That 'll give you something to talk about when you 're in the unemployment line ! Get out !  That went well . I have nothing to say to you . That would be a first . Dr . Collins ? - What ? - What ? - Which one ? - Which one ? - Dr . Nathan Collins . - Guilty . This is for you . - Sign here , please . - Sure . - Thanks . - Thank you . ? I got a package ... ?  Yes , sir . No problem . Six weeks will be just fine . - I 'm looking forward to - - -  Inga ! Get me a box of cigars ! You might have mentioned that was coming today . I told my lawyer not to send these here . I 'll just have them sent to your lawyer so she can take a look at them -- No need . Of course not . And in return , I 'm only gon na ask for one thing . And what 's that ? Nathan ? I want the ring back .  - It was my grandmother 's , remember ? - Of course . - She gave it to my mother . - Absolutely . And then on her deathbed she gave it to me -- I know the story , Nathan . Thank you . I 'll be right back . Hey , Gummo , Groucho , Red Dog . Listen up , boys . Word of advice : Do n't get married . You see something you like , you swim up behind it and then eat it . Got it ? Maybe she does n't really want a divorce . What ? Psychologically , I mean . Maybe somewhere deep in her subconscious she still has feelings for you , and it 's causing her body to rebel against her own actions . Men . Stupid grandmother 's aunt 's uncle 's neighbor 's I do n't care whose ring - - Stupid-  - No ! No ! No ! No !  Thank you , thank you , thank you . I never would have heard the end of that . Whoa ! She 's still in love . Yeah . Oh shit ! Marla ! Holy shit ! -  - Shoot , God damn it ! Shoot !    -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Okay , I gotcha . Come on , okay . Okay , it 's okay .  How you doing there , cowboy ? You 're not looking so good . Tequila is my middle name . Come on , get this stuff out . The sooner we get this done , the sooner you two ladies can go take a nap . Come on , we got about a five-hour window here . That fence is not going to fix itself .  Hey ! Mr . Secretary . Mr . Secretary . Mr . Secretary . Felix , Mr . Secretary . Look at him . You 'd think he 'd given birth to the damn fish . We are so not ready , Nathan .  Ah , General Remora , what a pleasure it is to see you , sir ! Remora : Nice pants ! Pretty impressive , huh ? All this fruit salad here just to see our little project . Even the top man himself . Makes you proud to be a scientist , does n't it ? Is everything ready , Avery ? As ready as it can be , Doc . Just so you guys know , nothing escapes my attention . Your fly 's open . Ladies and gentlemen , if you 'll be seated , we can begin . Thank you all for coming this morning for what is quite possibly the most important presentation you 'll ever see . Now , I 'd like to present General Remora , who would like to say a few words before we begin . General . What I 'm about to say to you ... must be kept ... in the utmost ... confidence . That is why I had to get a Level Five security clearance for each and every one of you . And that 's why we 're meeting in this underwater ... secured and protected bunker . In 1997 , the Russian government informed us ... that it may have lost at least 100 of their so-called " suitcase bombs . "  One kiloton ... portable nuclear bombs , small enough and light enough to be carried in a suitcase . And very possibly a backpack . Right . For some time we 've been concerned about the possibility of terrorist threat . And as of three days ago , our intelligence has informed us that one of these bombs had been purchased by a splinter group from an ex-Russian agent . Nathan , I know this is n't exactly the time to bring this up , - but ... - Yes ? - Um ... - Ahem ! It can wait . Further intelligence has informed us that this bomb will more than likely be arriving by water . And its goal very possibly being a very important landmark on or near this coast . That is why Project Blue Demon is of the utmost importance to our government . And , as Mr . Van Allen already knows , as of yesterday , the President of the United States of America has personally asked me ... to oversee this project . I 'd like everyone to put their hands in their lap . Very good . I will now turn everything back over to Mr . Van Allen . You know I hate when you do that . Do what ? Tell me you have something to tell me and then telling me to forget about it . Lawrence : So what is the answer ? More military ? More Coast Guard ? It would take three times the current numbers of enlisted men and women just to make a dent . No , the human element has done all that it can . It 's time now to take the next step toward complete military preparedness . I present Project Blue Demon ... a squadron of genetically engineered sharks , smarter and stronger than any other species on earth . Trained and controlled by our military and strategic experts to seek out and neutralize terrorist threats wherever they may be found . Maybe I do it because you never seem interested in anything I have to say anyway . Maybe if you 'd say things that were interesting , instead of dull scientific facts all the time , I would be . But Blue Demon misses nothing . Its natural and genetically-heightened territorial instinct . The shark locates the bomb before it can detonate . Now , if this sounds like science fiction , it 's not . It 's science fact . - So are you gon na tell me ? - Not when you 've predetermined your response . Can you stop being scientific for one moment and start being a human being ? Thanks . Thanks a lot . All right , I 'll tell you , but you have to promise that you wo n't be angry . - I 'm not - - ! - Nathan ! I 'm not angry . Open the curtain .  Blue Demon . Okay . I ... you know -- See , that 's exactly what I 'm talking about . Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke ? Oh my God . -  -  Where the hell are my sharks ? - Somebody opened the gate . I do n't give a good goddamn who let them out ! I want them back in here now ! I got some very important people in there waiting , so I do n't want to hear the word rain check from any one of you . I 'll just send the command out to Red Dog and the others will follow him back into the lake . If he 's still out there . What are you talking about , Dashlow ? Something 's wrong . I just sent out a return command and I 'm not getting a delivery signal . Did you try an alternate channel ? I 'm on full frequency - - nothing ! Let me try . Anybody got the time ? Too damn late for this bullshit ! That 's what time it is . Hey , did you guys hide my respirator ? You dogs , I know you hid my respirator ! What are those ? We were scheduled to keep the sharks inside all day today . Nathan : Maintenance , this is an emergency , do you copy ? Maintenance , this is Dr . Nathan Collins . Do you read me ? Maintenance , this is Dr . Nathan Collins . You need to get out of the water now ! Do you read me ? Over . How much longer are we gon na have to wait for these trained fish of yours ? Just a few more moments , sir . There 's been a small miscommunication and they 've been moved out into an enclosed high-security lagoon . Part of our facility . But there 's nothing to worry about . Everything 's under control .  - Still not getting anything . - Well try another transmitter . I tried all of them . I ca n't seem to get a response . Dr . Collins , if you people screw this thing up -- Nathan : Marla , do you read me , over ? - I 'm here , Nathan . - Give me some good news . We 're on our way out there now . Copy ?  Oh my God . Nathan , the sharks , they 're in hunt formation . Nathan : Maintenance , this is an emergency , do you copy ? Yeah , it 's always an emergency . Someone probably plugged up the toilet again . Maintenance , this is an emergency , do you copy ? This is an emergency ! Yeah , this is maintenance . What 's your emergency ? There are sharks in the lake ! Do you copy ? Ed , Jimmy ! Get out of the water ! There 's sharks in the water ! Get out ! Ed , Jimmy , come on ! Get in the - - no ! Get out of the water ! Katie : Jimmy ! Ed !  Oh , God !  Oh my God ! They were just out there ! - It 's over . - No , it 's not over . Every hard drive in the system 's up to speed . Not a crash , not a buzz . - Nothing . - Could have told you that . I know this lab inside and out and there 's nothing wrong with this equipment . I 've got six runaway sharks . Who would beg to differ ? They 're moving towards populated areas . I thought you had this problem worked out . Whoever let them out sabotaged the system . Then I guess it 's time for the backup plan . You do have a backup plan ? How ' bout a reboot ? Maybe we should just shut the whole thing down - and start from scratch . - Brilliant , Sparky . - Worth a try . - It 'll take time . - Then you 'd better get on it right now . - What are you gon na do ? What we should have done in the first place . I 'm calling the Coast Guard to let them know we got a predator problem on our hands . Thought you had left . As I stated before , we 've decided we 're not going to do the demonstration today . They 're not in the lagoon , are they ?  We 've got the situation under control . -  - Voice : T-minus 10 , nine , eight - -  Does n't look like you have anything under control . They 're headed toward beaches . We have to warn people . Tell them . Tell them what ? That a group of government sanctioned genetic experiments has gotten loose ? No . If they found out that the military was behind this , we 'd be in a shitstorm of apocalyptic proportions ! No , I think what we have here is just regular , everyday run-of-the-mill sharks . And the truth of the matter is sharks kill people , every day . But not in a freshwater lake . Minor detail . Every war has their casualties . I do n't see any reason the war on terrorism should be any different . Screw that .  Get me the number for the Coast Guard . Yeah . Hey , what the hell do you think you 're doing ? Do n't worry , Doctor , you 'll get to make your one phone call . - What are you talking about ? - Dr . Nathan Collins , - you 're under arrest . - On what charge ? Conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the United States of America . General , I understand what you 're trying to do here , but you have no evidence of anything like that . I have all the evidence I need . This is a log for all the security pass codes for the shark pool . And it has the number of the last code used - to open the gates . - And whose number is that ? - Dr . Nathan Collins . -  Please . He 's doing this because he does n't want me telling anyone about the sharks . I 'm doing this because I love my country . Take him away . Get me a lawyer ! This is not over ! No , like this . You have to hook the worm through his body like that so he does n't fall off the hook . Here , now you try . I do n't want to . Honey , the worm does n't feel anything . It does n't hurt him . Yeah , how would you like it if I stuck a hook up your -- That 's enough , young lady . Why do we have to do this anyway ? Ca n't we just buy fish at the store ? No , we ca n't just buy fish at the store . That 's not a sport . This is a sport . Baseball 's a sport . Basketball 's a sport . This is murder ! - And you wanted to go fishing with Daddy , too , did n't you ? - Yes . - Now you got a 10-lb . test line here , with an eight-lb . leader . Just set it over the side right here . There you go . All right , now we 'll just see who catches the big one , huh ? Hey , what 's up , doc ? Oh , I guess I 'm just a little blurry here . Yeah , you gon na go somewhere ? Just a little fresh air . Be right back . You want me to go with you ? Avery , " fresh air " is a euphemism . I 'm going to the ladies ' room . - Oh . - Yeah .  Dad , I think I 've got something ! Way to go ! Reel him in ! - Not too fast . - It 's really heavy . It 's probably a trout . They get pretty big in these waters . Let 's try to get him in now . Let 's reel it in . That 's it , bring it in here . Yeah , it 's a big one ! Wowee ! Okay , here it comes . Roxie : Oh my God ! You got him ! Let 's get him . Oh , yeah ! Okay , good job ! Oh , yeah ! Look what you caught here ! Hold it , I 'll get a photo . Slimy ! - Let me get a photo . Okay , hold it up . - It 's wet ! Attagirl . Hold it right there . -  - What the hell ? - What 's the matter , honey ? - It 's a shark ! It 's a bass , silly . Dad ! Dad ! Shark ! Hurry , swim ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! - Swim ! - Dad , grab this ! Swim , that 's right ! Do n't look back ! Dad , keep swimming . Please , hurry ! Sharks , that way ! There you go ! I got you . Dad , I love you . I love you , Dad . Marla ! Thank God , finally ! Did you talk to the lawyer ? Is he coming down to get me out of here ? I 'm afraid not , Nathan . What , are you kidding me ? They ca n't just hold me here without formal charges , without any evidence . Well apparently they can . Just the suspicion of you being a terrorist is enough for them to lock you up in here indefinitely . Wait , this is nuts . I brought you some food . I feel like I 'm stuck in some play by Kafka . Watch your language , sir . - What ? - Your language . - I said Kafka . - I heard what you said . There 's a lady present . Appreciate it if you 'd keep it clean . I 'll take that , ma'am . Please ? - I 'll have to check it . - It 's nothing special , but it was all they had in the cafeteria .  - All right . -  Christ , Marla , what the hell are you doing ? Getting you out of here . I appreciate the thought , but should n't we wait to do this , I do n't know , the legal way ? While I was rebooting the system I ran through the program logs and checked it against my private backup file . The reason the system crashed was because it was n't the real system . It was some shadow program - built of top of the original . -  It was designed to hide in the hard drives when we tried to fix it . Are you telling me that somebody tried to hack in from the outside ? Not that kind of program , no . This came from somebody who had access to our entire system from the inside . He would never put himself out of a job . This came from higher up . I ca n't believe you just tranked that guy . I did n't know you had it in you . There 's a lot of things you did n't know about me , Nathan .  Sorry . Dr . Collins , I need an up - - where is she ? - Ladies ' room . - How long has she been gone ? - I do n't know , 20 minutes , maybe . - 20 minutes ? Hey , chicks take forever in the bathroom . Idiot !    This is Lawrence Van Allen to the holding cell . Come in . This is Lawrence Van Allen to the guard holding Dr . Collins . Do you copy ? Holding cell , come in ! Do something ! My God . What happened ? Where 'd they go ?  Put security on full alert ! Find Dr . Collins . - Hi , Mark . It 's so lovely today I just thought I 'd play hooky . No problem , Doctor . I just got ta check out your car . - My car ? - Yeah , it 's a new company policy . I guess there 's some stuff that 's gone missing - from a couple of the labs . - Really ? Yeah , I know , who 'd want to steal a couple of test tubes , huh ? Anyway , I got ta check every vehicle that goes out of here . It 's not your fault though . Of course not . - This is fine . - Oh , good good . - Well , have a nice day . - Trunk too . - The trunk ? - Yeah . It 's a real pain in the butt , ma'am . Sorry . Man on radio : Gate Security , come in . - Excuse me . - Wait . I guess whatever they 're squawking about can wait a sec . Thank you so much . You 're the best . And just because of that , I 'm gon na give you the honor of checking out my trunk . What the hell ? Now , I know this looks suspicious , uh ...  Nathan ! See , I bet there are still things about me you do n't know . - Obviously you 're right . - Hey , come on ! - It 's so pretty . - Not as pretty as you . Smooth . - The water looks great . - Uh-huh . We should go for a swim . I did n't bring my suit . You do n't need a suit . LC , are you crazy ? We ca n't just take off our clothes . Why not ? There 's nobody around . Right now . - I 'm not afraid . - Oh yeah ? Hey , you did bring your suit ! - Coming ? - Yeah . What are you doing ? This water 's cold , baby . So who 's afraid now ? What would I possibly be afraid of ? You know , that was my first kiss . Really ? Where are you going ? To the moon ! That was my first kiss , too . Well , ready or not , here I come . LC ? Very funny , LC . Shark ! Shark ! Come on , I 've been called worse . Oh my God ! Come on ! Okay , keep your eyes open . If you see anybody - - cops , security , anybody - - take off . No , I 'm not gon na leave you . I was hoping you 'd say that . I need to speak to whoever 's in charge of ... well , sharks . Okay , I know this is gon na sound crazy , but , uh ... My name ? That 's not important . What 's important is that you need to send your boats out right now armed with everything you 've got . Why ? Because ... because there are half a dozen government-grown killer sharks on the hunt along the beaches of this city . And unless your people take action right now a lot of people are going to die . Hello ? Aw , do n't do this . Hello ? Hey , I 'm serious here ! Hello ! Goddamn bureaucrats ! Shit ! Marla ! - Change for a 20 ? - No ! Hey ! You guys got change for a 20 ? Thank you . Unbelievable . Un-believable ! - So how 'd it go with the Coast Guard ? - Not great . - Well , I got something better , this . The signal might be a little weak , but if I can tap into the lab 's transmitter and then into this -- You 're going to try to control six sharks with your laptop , a cell phone and a car radio ? That 's your problem , Nathan . You 're always so negative . - Negative ? - Negative , yes , negative . You might try seeing the cup half full for a change .  Reporter : In other news , police are on a manhunt this hour for Dr . Marla and Nathan Collins from Acro Marine with alleged ties to a terrorist organization working right here in Northern California . They are considered armed and dangerous ... Hmm , you 're right . Things are looking up already . Now back to the music . I 've been at it for two solid hours . I 'm starving , dude . Well , do n't let our little emergency come between you and your Twinkies ! - What now ? - There 's another signal here . Somebody 's tapped into the command frequency . - They 're trying to communicate with the sharks . - It 's them . Looks like they 're using a phone line to hack into the system . Probably a cell phone . Can you track the signal , find out where they are ? Yeah , I guess . But that 's like totally illegal . Hello ! Government . That 's what we do . Find them ! Not cool . - Anything ? - Still searching for a signal . Look , maybe you 're right . Maybe this is a stupid idea . Hey , do n't say that . - Why not ? It 's what you 're thinking anyway . - No it 's not . It 's okay , Nathan . I 'm a big girl , I can take it . I was thinking you 're the smartest wom -- you 're the smartest human being I 've ever met . I thought it was my ass . Well , okay , maybe it was a little bit your ass . I watch you , you know ? When you work . and you get that far away look in your eyes , and I wonder what it must be like to be in there with you . What was that thing that you were gon na tell me before all this started ? Okay , um - -  I got a signal ! I found them ! Oh my God . Okay , they breached the lake . They 're in the ocean . - They 're still traveling in a group formation . - Where are they ? Well , according to this , just a few miles ahead . Okay good , this is a nice desolate area . Let 's just hope they find a nice long , lonely beach with nobody around for miles . - This is not good . - No it 's not . If the uplink to the main transmitter holds , then I -- - Nathan , I 'm just not sure . - Hey ! Think positive . Give it a shot . - What are you doing ? - I did n't have much luck with the Coast Guard . Let 's see if I can convince these kids I 'm not crazy . Have you actually seen these sharks around here ? No , not exactly , but we 've been tracking them from down the coast . My wife - - well , my ex-wife , she 's in the car with a computer ... -  - ... trying to send a signal to them - with her cell phone -- - Okay , look , Doctor ... - Collins . - Dr . Collins . I know you 're probably under a lot of stress , but they have laws against drinking on the beach . Drinking alone , that is .  Keep trying , Jen ! - I 'm sorry . - You need to exit the vehicle now , ma'am . Jesus Christ ! It 's a shark ! It 's a shark ! Get out of here ! Holy cow ! Come on ! Get out of the water ! Come on ! Everybody out ! Hey , come on ! There are sharks in the water . What are you doing ? Come here ! Come on ! Hey , come here !  Dr . Collins , look out !  - Fuck it ! -  Hi . Hi . How do you feel ? Okay , I guess . My leg 's a little itchy . What the hell ? No ! Oh , God , no ! No ! Bad dream ? Oh , God , okay . What happened ? I um ... overloaded the signal . Blew the chips . They 're dead ? Oh God , Marla , I 'm sorry . This project ... That 'll save me having to repeat myself . Lawrence , I think this can wait until after Nathan gets some rest . I had six very expensive sharks at the start of this . I now have none . Somebody has to pay . Take a hike , Larry . - Four . - What ? There were only four sharks at the beach . I only saw four . Are you sure ? Trust me , it 's not something I would forget . This is Van Allen . How many carcasses did you retrieve ? I see . And did you -- Thank you . Four . Another one dead from an overzealous fisherman . No sign of the sixth one anywhere . Okay , they 've been traveling in school formation all along . What would finally make them separate ? Maybe they did n't . Maybe they were never together in the first place . Hey , guys , great job with the sharks ! I heard all about it . You guys deserve a medal . Stuff it , Avery . Wha - - how 'd that happen ? - Says it 's real time . - But it 's not monitoring anything at all . - This is a program he made , a decoy . - To throw us off track . You guys do n't know what you 're talking about . You know they 're dangerous . You were after them ! They 're terrorists ! All right , " dude , " where 's my shark ? I believe I can answer that question for you . Ah , General . We did n't expect to see you .  Everybody up against the wall . Not you , Dashlow . Oh , yeah . General , I 'm not sure I understand . Of course you do n't understand , Van Allen . Because you 're nothing more than a patsy . This whole thing - - the computer shutdown , the sharks ' escape - - it was all you . He had a little help . Why , Avery ? You ca n't buy Porsches with dreams . That 's exactly why , because I am a patriot . This government of ours is weak . We were doing okay for a while there . We had our heads on straight about terrorism . But now they 're starting to divert money into social programs , schools , the homeless , the poor . Before you know it our military wo n't be more than a couple of Boy Scouts walking around carrying penknives . Well it 's not gon na happen on my watch ! Then I thought this shark of yours ... well , now if he can defuse a bomb , he sure as hell can deliver one . Red Dog . Smartest in the class .  - World record ! - Nice toss .  I 'm going to get him . No no come back ! Forget about him ! We need to find Red Dog . He said it could plant a bomb . - Avery . - Avery . Cheap , just like I suspected .  Where are you going , Avery ? Come here , you lousy punk ! Avery 's been doing his homework . Okay . -  -  Charming . Okay , this is the original command program and that is the shadow program that he created . And here 's our missing shark . It 's Red Dog . Whoa whoa ! What is that ? I do n't know . It 's reading on the image . Oh my God . Plutonium . It 's the Russian suitcase bomb . Remora bought it for himself . What 's the target ? Somewhere further up the coast . I 'm just getting the coordinates now . I 'll just bring it up here on the map . And I 'll try to reprogram Red Dog . You ca n't try , Marla . You can do it . Okay , and it should be right there . But I bet somebody else will for that . Nathan ?   Ow ! What the ? Avery ! You dumb-ass moron !   My God !   God !  - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm okay , yeah . The command key !  -  - Wait , where 's he going now ? Without a command program the chip defaults ... to the original setting . Hello , this is Lawrence Van Allen calling . Yes , I was wondering , is that teaching position at the university still open ? Yes I 'll hold . You can forget about that tenure of yours , Van Allen . I 'll make sure of that . Another trumped-up charge , General ? I do n't think so . It 's you alone who will be counting ceiling tiles at Leavenworth .  Can you say sushi ? -  -   Radio announcer : A nuclear accident at Acro Marine Laboratory was just that - - an accident . There 's been no evidence of foul play and absolutely no indications of terrorist involvement . Thankfully the facility is equipped with lead- shielded walls to handle such incidents and the repercussions , if any , are negligible to the public safety . There will be an investigation and a full hearing into the matter . - You ready for this ? - All I can do is tell the truth . I 'll just tell them exactly what happened . - Wait . - What ? You never told me . That thing that you were gon na tell me ? Oh right , that . Um ... Yeah , that , uh ... so , what do you say ? Right here , right now , before flag and country , what was it ? The divorce papers . God , I missed that ass ! Come on , kids . They 're waiting . Senator : All right , Dr . Collins , why do n't you all start at the beginning . Tell us how this all happened . Marla : As you know , Senator , with the airways relatively safe it was time to begin covertly securing our oceans and waterways . It started out as an experiment . The first change was in the eyes . The iris separated from the pupil and it followed movement like a motion detector . I 'd watch them hours on end and when they 'd see me they 'd stare back , unblinking , unemotional . Sometimes I swear they were laughing at me . But we made a horrible mistake . We meant to take the next step in evolution , but we created a monster . Senator : I see . And would you say it was possible for this sort of thing to happen again ? Honestly , Senator , I do n't know ... ?

AII that stuff I 've talked about . POP : still after that first million before 30 ? GEORGE : I'II settle for half that in cash . POP : Of course it 's just a hope ..... Annie , why do n't you draw up a chair ? Then you could hear everything that 's going on . ANNIE : I would if I thought I 'd hear anything worthwhile . GEORGE : You would , huh ? POP : I know it 's soon to talk about it . GEORGE : Now , Pop , I could n't . I could n't face being cooped up for the rest of my Iife ... in a shabby little office . I 'm sorry , Pop . I did n't mean that . It 's this business of nickels and dimes ... . and spending your life trying to save 3 cents on pipe . I 'd go crazy . I want to do something big and important . George , I feel that in a small way ... we 're doing something important - - satisfying a fundamental urge . It 's deep in the race for a man ... to want his own roof , walls , and fireplace . We 're helping him get those things ... I know that . I wish I felt that , uh ... I 've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to -- Most of my friends have already finished college . I just feel like if I did n't get away , I 'd bust ! POP : Yes , you 're right , son . GEORGE : You see what I mean , Pop ? POP : This town is no place for any man ... unless he 's willing to crawl to Potter . You 've got talent , son . I 've seen it . You get yourself an education and get out of here . Pop , you want a shock ? I think you 're a great guy . Did you hear that , Annie ? I heard it . It 's about time one of you Iunkheads said it . I 'm going to miss old Annie . Pop , I think I'II get dressed and go over to Harry 's party . POP : Have a good time , son . GEORGE : Excuse me . I 'm going to put him through college . SAM : Hee-haw ! GEORGE : Sam Wainwright . How are you ? When did you get here ? SAM : This afternoon . I thought I 'd give the kids a treat . GEORGE : old college graduate now . SAM : old Joe college Wainwright they call me . Freshman , looks like you'II make it after all . Harry , you 're the guy I want to see . Coach has heard all about you . He 's followed every game . He wants me to find out if you 're coming along . HARRY : I got to make some dough first . SAM : Make it fast . We need great ends like you ... not broken-down old guys like him . Hee-haw ! PARTRIDGE : George , welcome back . GEORGE : Mr . Partridge , how are you ? PARTRIDGE : Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea . Saved us another building . Harry , Sam , have lots of fun . - hello , violet . - hello . What am I bid ?

GEORGE : Do n't be long , Marty . I 'm not being a wet nurse to a -- BOY : Some guy came up and tripped me . If not for that , that race would have been a cinch . I tried to find out later who it was ... but I could n't find out . Nobody would ever tell you whoever it was . GEORGE : well , well , well . BOY : Now to get back to my story , see ...  BOY : Hey , this is my dance . GEORGE : Why do n't you stop annoying people ? BOY : well , I 'm sorry . Hey ! GEORGE : well , hello . MARY : hello . You look at me as if you did n't know me . well , I do n't . You 've passed me on the street almost every day . Me ? No . That was a little girl named Mary Hatch . Oh , yes ! Oh , yes !

Ca n't you come out tonight ? buffalo gals , ca n't you come out tonight ... And ... Dance ... By the light ... Of da moon ? GEORGE : Oh , hot dog . Just like an organ . I told Harry I thought I 'd be bored . You should have seen that locker room . I had to knock down three people to get this stuff . Let me hold that wet dress . MARY : Do I Iook as funny as you do ? GEORGE : I 'm not the football type . You look wonderful ! well , why do n't you say it ? GEORGE : Maybe I will say it . How old are you anyway ? MARY : Eighteen . Eighteen ? only last year you were 17 . Too young or too old ? Oh , no . Just right . Your age fits you . You look a little older without your clothes on . I mean , without a dress you look older . I mean younger . You Iook - - you just -- Uh-oh ! Oh , I 'm on the thing here . MARY : Sir , my train , please . GEORGE : A pox upon me for a clumsy Iout . Your ... your caboose , milady . - You may kiss my hand . - Mmm . GEORGE : Hey . Hey , Mary . As I was Iumberin ' down the street ... Down the street , down the street ... GEORGE : I'II throw a rock at the old GranviIIe house . MARY : Do n't . I Iove that old house . MARY : Do n't . It 's full of romance , that old place . I 'd Iike to live in it . GEORGE : In that place ? I would n't live in it as a ghost . Watch this . Right in the second floor , there . See ?  What did you wish , George ? Not just one wish - - a whole hatful . I know what I 'm going to do ... tomorrow and the next day and next year . I 'm shaking the dust of this crummy town off my feet ... and I 'm going to see the world ! italy , Greece , the Parthenon , the coliseum . Then I'II go to college and see what they know . Then I 'm gon na build things . I'II build airfields and skyscrapers 100 stories high . I'II build bridges a mile long . You going to throw a rock ?  Hey , that 's pretty good ... And ... Dance by the light of da moon ? What did you wish when you threw that rock ? MARY : No . If I told you , it might not come true . What is it you want ? What do you want ? You want the moon ? Just say the word , and I'II Iasso it and pull it down . That 's a pretty good idea . I'II give you the moon . I'II take it . Then what ? Then you could swallow it , and it would all dissolve ... and the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and toes ... and the ends of your hair . Am I talking too much ? Yes ! - Why do n't you kiss her ? - How 's that ? Why do n't you kiss her instead of talking her to death ? You want me to kiss her ? Aw , youth is wasted on the wrong people . Hey , hold on , mister .  Mary ?  OK , I give up . Where are you ? Over here in the hydrangea bushes . Here you are . Catch . Wait a minute . What am I doing ? This is a very interesting situation . MARY : please give me my robe . GEORGE : A man does n't get in a situation like this every day . MARY : I 'd Iike to have my robe . GEORGE : Not in Bedford falls , anyway . MARY : Ouch ! Oh ! GEORGE : Gesundheit . This requires some thought . MARY : George bailey , give me my robe . GEORGE : I 've read about things like this . MARY : Shame on you ! I 'm going to tell your mother . GEORGE : My mother 's way up on the corner there . MARY : I'II call the police . GEORGE : They 're way downtown . They 'd be on my side , too . MARY : I 'm going to scream ! GEORGE : Maybe I could sell tickets . I'II make a deal with you , Mary . BILLY : George ! George ! BILLY : George , come on home ! Quick ! Your father 's had a stroke . GEORGE : What ? Mary , I 'm sorry . I 've got to go . Did you get a doctor ? BILLY : campbell 's there now . CAMPBELL : That 's all , George . I know you 're anxious to make a train . GEORGE : I have a taxi waiting downstairs . CAMPBELL : You know , George gave up his Europe trip ... to help straighten things out these past few months . Good luck to you at school . And now , the real purpose of this meeting - - to appoint a successor to Peter bailey . POTTER : I 'd Iike to get to my real purpose -- - Wait -- - For what ? This institution is not necessary to this town . Therefore , I make a motion to dissolve this institution ..... to talk about chIoroforming the building and Loan . SECOND MAN : Peter bailey died three months ago . I second Mr . Potter 's motion . CAMPBELL : Very well . In that case ... I'II ask the two executive officers to withdraw . The whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow ... at the passing of Peter bailey . It was his faith and devotion ... that are responsible for this organization . POTTER : I'II go further than that . To the public , Peter bailey was the building and Loan . BILLY : That 's fine , coming from you . You probably drove him to his grave ! POTTER : Peter bailey was not a businessman . That 's what killed him . Oh , I do n't mean any disrespect to him . He was a man of high ideals ... so-caIIed . But ideals without common sense can ruin this town ... in his taxi , you know . I happen to know the bank turned down this Ioan . But he comes here ... and we 're building him a house worth $5,000 . Why ? GEORGE : I handled that , Mr . Potter . You have all the papers there . I can vouch for his character . - A friend of yours ? - Yes , sir . POTTER : If you shoot pool with some employee here ... you can come and borrow money . What does that get us ? A discontented , lazy rabble ... instead of a thrifty working class . And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers ... like Peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads ... with a Iot of impossible ideas . Now , I say -- GEORGE : Just a minute . hold on , Mr . Potter . You 're right when you say my father was no businessman . Why he started this penny-ante building and Loan ... I'II never know ..... he never once thought of himself . He did n't save enough money for Harry or me to go to school ... but he did help a few people get out of your slums . What 's wrong with that ? You 're all businessmen here . Does n't it make them better citizens and customers ? You said that they had to wait and save their money ... before they even thought of a decent home . Wait until their children grow up and leave them ? Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000 ? Just remember that this rabble you 're talking about - - they do most of the working , paying , living , and dying ... in this community . Is it too much to work , pay , live , and die ... in a couple of decent rooms and a bath ? My father did n't think so . people were human beings to him , but to you ... a warped , frustrated old man , they 're cattle . I 'm not interested in your book . I 'm talking about the building and Loan . You 're talking about something you ca n't get your fingers on ... and it 's galling you . I know . well , I 've said too much . You 're the board . You do what you want . Just one thing more . This town needs this measly institution ... if only to have someplace where people can come ... without crawling to Potter . Come on .  sentimental hogwash . I want my motion acted on .  BILLY : Boy , oh , boy , George . You shut his big mouth . EUSTACE : What happened ? We heard yelling . BILLY : We 're being voted out of business after 25 years . Easy come , easy go . ERNIE : You want me to hang around , George ? GEORGE : Yeah . I'II be right down . BILLY : You'II miss your train . Go on . I 'm only 55 . TILLY : Fifty-six . BILLY : Go on . You do n't want to miss college , do you ? CAMPBELL : George ! George ! They voted Potter down . They want to keep it going . They 've got only one condition ... and that 's the best part of it - - they 've appointed George as executive secretary . GEORGE : But uncle BiIIy -- CAMPBELL : You can keep him on . As secretary , you can hire anyone . GEORGE : Let 's get this straight . I 'm leaving . I 'm going to school . This is my last chance . uncle billy , he 's your man . CAMPBELL : George , they'II vote with Potter otherwise . CLARENCE : I know . He did n't go . JOSEPH : That 's right . Not only that ... but he gave his school money to his brother Harry ... and sent him to college . Harry became a football star . Made second team aII-American ... waiting for Harry to come back ... and take over the building and Loan . There are plenty of jobs for somebody that likes to travel . venezuela oil fieIds - - ' ? Wanted - - man with construction experience . ' ? The Yukon - - ' ? Wanted - - man with engineering experience . ' ?  There she blows . Know what the 3 most exciting sounds in the world are ? BILLY : Breakfast is served , lunch is served , dinner -- GEORGE : No . Anchor chains , plane motors , train  . Peanut . GEORGE : There 's the professor now . old professor Phi Beta Kappa , aII-American bailey . HARRY : uncle billy , you have n't changed . BILLY : Nobody ever changes here . GEORGE : Boy , am I glad to see you . - Where 's Mother ? - Home cooking the fatted calf . HARRY : Wait a minute . George , I want you to meet Ruth . - hello . - Ruth Dakin . Here she is . Meet the wife . BILLY : What do you know ? A wife ! GEORGE : How do you do ? congratulations . What am I doing ? congratulations ! BILLY : Goodness , Harry ! GEORGE : They 're married ! Why do n't you tell somebody ? BILLY : Mrs . bailey , I ca n't wait to see -- Are you really married ? GEORGE : What 's a pretty girl like you doing ... marrying this two-headed brother of mine ? RUTH : I'II tell you . It 's purely mercenary . My father offered him a job . BILLY : He got you and a job ? Harry 's cup runneth over . HARRY : About that job - - I never said I 'd take it . You 've been holding the bag here for four years . I wo n't let you down , George . I forgot the bags . I'II be right back . BILLY : It was a surprise to me . This is the new Mrs . BILLY : And I want to tell you ... we 're going to give the biggest party ... this town ever saw . GEORGE : Harry will be right here . RUTH : Here , have some popcorn . George , George , George - - that 's all Harry ever talks about . GEORGE : Ruth , this ... What about this job ? RUTH : My father owns a glass factory in buffalo . He wants to get Harry started in the research business . GEORGE : Is it a good job ? RUTH : Very . Not much money , but a good future . Harry 's a genius at research . My father just fell in love with him . GEORGE : You did , too , huh ? PHOTOGRAPHER : hold it ! hold it ! That 's it ! BILLY : Oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy ! I feel so good , I could spit in Potter 's eye . Where 's my hat ? Where 's my hat ? Oh . Thank you , George . - Which is mine ? - The middle one . Thank you , George . Now , look ... if you'II point me in the right direction -- would you do that , George ? old building and Loan pal , huh ? GEORGE : You turn this way and right straight down . My wild Irish rose ...  I 'm all right ! I 'm all right ! The sweetest flower that grows ...  Oh , hello , Ma . That 's for nothing . How do you Iike her ? GEORGE : She 's swell .

GEORGE : Did she discuss it with you ? - No . - Then how do you know ? I 've got eyes , have n't I ? She lights up like a firefly whenever you 're around . Besides , Sam Wainwright 's away in New York ... and you 're here in Bedford falls . GEORGE : And all 's fair in love and war . MA : I do n't know about war .

Let 's make a night of it . VIOLET : What'II we do ? Let 's go to the fields , take off our shoes ... and walk through the grass . Huh ? We can go up to the falls . It 's beautiful in the moonlight . There 's a green pool up there , and we can swim in it . Then we can climb Mount Bedford ... and watch the sun rise against the peaks . we'll stay up there the whole night . GEORGE : OK . Just forget about the whole thing . MARY : What are you doing , picketing ? hello , Mary . I just happened to be passing by . Yes , so I noticed . Have you made up your mind ? - How 's that ? - Have you made up your mind ? - About what ? - About coming in . Your mother phoned and said you were coming to visit . My mother just called ? How did she know ? - Did n't you tell her ? - I did n't tell anybody . I went for a walk and happened to be passing by . What do you -- Went for a walk , that 's all . - I'II be downstairs , mother . - AII right , dear .  well , are you coming in or are n't you ? well , I'II come in for a minute . But I - - I ... Where did you get that dress ? Do you Iike it ? It 's all right . GEORGE : I thought you 'd go back to New York ... like Sam and Angie and the rest of them . I worked there a couple of vacations , but I do n't know . I guess I was homesick . Homesick ? For Bedford falls ? Yes , and my family and ... Oh , everything . would you Iike to sit down ? GEORGE : AII right . For a minute . I still ca n't understand it . I did n't tell anybody I was coming here . would you rather leave ? GEORGE : No .

MOTHER : tell him to go home and do n't you leave the house ! Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York . What 's your mother mean ? I did n't come here to -- MARY : What did you come here for , then ? GEORGE : I do n't know . You tell me . - Good night . - Good night ! MOTHER : Mary ! Mary ! The telephone . It 's Sam .

GEORGE : I forgot my hat . Hee-haw ! hello , Sam . How are you ? SAM : I 'm great . It 's good to hear your voice again . MARY : That 's awfully sweet of you . There 's an old friend of yours here - - George bailey . SAM : You mean old mossback George ? MARY : Yes . old mossback George . SAM : Hee-haw ! Put him on . MARY : Just a minute . I'II call him . George ! MOTHER : He does n't want to speak to George , you idiot ! MARY : He asked for him . Hey , a fine pal you are . What are you trying to do , steal my girl ? What do you mean ? Nobody 's trying to steal anybody 's girl . Here . Here 's Mary . SAM : Wait ! tell Mary to get on the extension . - Mother 's on the extension . - I am not ! We can both hear . Come here . We 're listening , Sam . SAM : I have a big deal that'll make us all rich . George , you remember that night in Martini 's bar ... when you told me you read someplace ... about making plastics out of soybeans ? You remember , out of chiIi - - out of soybeans ? GEORGE : Uh , uh ... Yeah , yeah . Soybean , yeah . SAM : well , Dad snapped up the idea ... and he 's going to build a factory ... outside of Rochester . Why not right here ? You remember that old tool and machinery works ? tell your father he can get that for a song ... and all the labor he wants , too . half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down . SAM : Is that so ? I'II tell him . Hey , that sounds great ! I knew you 'd come through . Now , here 's the point -- Mary , you 're in on this , too . Have you got any money ? GEORGE : Money ? Yeah . well , a little . SAM : I want you to put every cent into our stock . And George , I may have a job for you . That is , unless you 're still married ... to that broken-down building and Loan . This is the biggest thing since radio ... and I 'm letting you in on the ground floor . Oh , Mary ... Mary ! MARY : I-I 'm here . SAM : will you tell that guy ... He says it 's the chance of a lifetime . Now , you listen to me . I do n't want any plastics , I do n't want ground floors ... and I do n't want to get married , ever , to anyone . You understand that ? I want to do what I want to do ... and you 're ... and you 're ... Oh , Mary , Mary . George , George , George . Oh , Mary . Oh ! Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Oh , dear . Mary ... Here they come !  VIOLET : Good-bye ! Have a wonderful time ! MA : First Harry , now George . Annie , we 're just two old maids now . ANNIE : You speak for yourself , Miss B . ERNIE : If either of you see a stranger , it 's me . GEORGE : Hey , look . Somebody 's driving this cab . ERNIE : Bert the cop sent this over . float away to Happy Land on the bubbles . There 's the kitty , Ernie . Count it , Mary . MARY : I feel like a bootlegger 's wife . GEORGE : We 're going to shoot the works ! A whole week in New York , a whole week in Bermuda . The highest hotels , the oldest champagne ... the richest caviar , the hottest music ... and the prettiest wife . ERNIE : Rrrow ! That does it . Then what ? GEORGE : Then what , honey ? MARY : After that , who cares ? GEORGE : Rrrow ! That does it . Come here . ERNIE : There 's something funny going on at the bank . I 've never really seen one ... but that 's got all the earmarks of a run . MAN : Ernie , if you got money in the bank , you better hurry . MARY : George , Iet 's not stop . Let 's go . GEORGE : Just a minute , dear . GEORGE : I'II be back in a minute . GEORGE : hello , everybody . Mrs . Thompson , how are you ? charlie , what 's the matter here ? Ca n't you get in ?  What is this , uncle billy , a holiday ? George . GEORGE : Come on in , everybody . That 's right . Just come on in .  Look out . Why do n't you all sit down ? There are a Iot of seats over there . Just make yourselves at home .  BILLY : Can I see you a minute ? GEORGE : Why did n't you call me ? BILLY : I did , but you 'd left . This is a pickle ! GEORGE : What happened ? How 'd it start ? - The bank called our Ioan . - When ? An hour ago . I handed over all our cash ... and still it was less than we owe . Then I got scared and closed the doors . GEORGE : hello ? POTTER : There is a rumor that you 've closed your doors . Is that true ? Oh , well , I 'm very glad to hear that . Are you all right ? Do you need any police ? police ? What for ? Mobs get pretty ugly sometimes . George , I am going aII-out to help in this crisis . I have just guaranteed the banks ... sufficient funds to meet their needs . They will close up for a week and then reopen . GEORGE : He just took over the bank . POTTER : I may lose a fortune ... but I am willing to guarantee your people , too . Just tell them to bring their shares over here ... and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar . You never miss a trick , do you , Potter ? well , you'II miss this one . If you close your doors before 6 p.m ... . you will never reopen . GEORGE : Now ... just remember that this thing is n't as black as it appears .  GEORGE : I have some news for you , folks . I just talked to Potter ... and he 's guaranteed cash payments for the bank . The bank will reopen next week . ED : But , George , I got my money here . CHARLIE : Did he guarantee this place ? GEORGE : No , charlie . We do n't need Potter over here . CHARLIE : Then I'II take mine now . GEORGE : No , but you 're -- You 're thinking of this place all wrong ... as if I had the money back in a safe . The money 's not here . Your money 's in Joe 's house and in the Kennedy house ... and Mrs . MackIin 's house and a hundred others . You 're lending them the money to build ... and they'II pay it back as best they can . You sign this . You'II get your money in 60 days . TOM : 60 days ? GEORGE : That 's what you agreed when you bought your shares . - Tom , did you get your money ? - No . RANDALL : Potter pays 50 cents on the dollar for every share . - 50 cents ? - Cash . TOM : well , what do you say ? GEORGE : You have to stick to your original agreement . Give us 60 days . - OK , randall . - Are you going to Potter 's ? TOM : Better to get half than nothing . GEORGE : Tom ! Tom ! randall ! Wait . Now , listen to me . I beg of you not to do this . If Potter gets ahold of this building and Loan ... there'II never be another decent house built in this town . He 's got charge of the bank ... the bus line , the department stores ... and now he 's after us . He wants to keep you living in his slums ... and paying the kind of rent he decides . Joe , you had one of Potter 's houses . Have you forgotten what he charged you for that shack ? Ed , last year when you could n't make your payments ... you did n't lose your house . You think Potter would 've let you keep it ? Ca n't you understand what 's happening here ? Do n't you see what 's happening ? Potter is n't selling , Potter 's buying ! And why ? Because we 're panicky , and he 's not . He 's picking up some bargain . We can get through this thing all right . We 've got to stick together , though . We 've got to have faith in each other . WOMAN : But my husband has n't worked in over a year . SECOND WOMAN : How will I Iive until the bank opens ? - I got doctor bills to pay . - I need cash ! AII right , Tom , how much do you need ? TOM : $242 . GEORGE : Tom , just enough to tide you over . TOM : I'II take $242 . - There you are . - that'll close my account . Your account 's still here . That 's a Ioan . - AII right , Ed . - I got $300 here . What will it take until the bank opens ? ED : well , I suppose $20 . GEORGE : Twenty dollars . Now you 're talking . Thanks , Ed . Mrs . Thompson , how much do you want ? MRS . THOMPSON : But it 's your own money . GEORGE : Never mind . How much do you want ? MRS . THOMPSON : $20 , and I'II sign the paper . GEORGE : You do n't have to sign anything . I know you . Pay it when you can . AII right . Miss Davis ? could I have 17.50 ? GEORGE : bless your heart . They'II never close us up today ! GEORGE : Five , four ... three , two ... one ... bingo ! We made it ! close the door , Eustace ! We 've still got 2 bucks left . Let 's have some of that . Let 's celebrate ! Get some glasses , TiIIy . We 're a couple of financial wizards . BILLY : Those RockefeIIers ! GEORGE : Get a tray for these two important simoIeons . BILLY : we'll save ' em for seed . A toast ! GEORGE : A toast to Mama dollar and Papa dollar ... and if you want to keep us in business ... you 'd better have a family real quick . TILLY : I wish they were rabbits . GEORGE : Let 's put them in the safe and see what happens .  EUSTACE : folks , wedding cigars . GEORGE : Oh-oh . Wedding . holy mackerel , I 'm married . Where 's Ma - - Mary ! GEORGE : will you get my wife on the phone ? TILLY : Mrs . bailey is on the phone . I do n't want Mrs . bailey . I want my wife . Mrs . bailey . That 's - - that 's my wife . Here , I'II take it in here . Mary ? hello . Listen , dear , I 'm sorry . Huh ? Come home ? What home ? 320 Sycamore ? Whose home is that ? The WaIdorf hotel , huh ? MAN : That 's company posters . The company wo n't like this . BERT : How would you Iike to get a ticket ? Is n't there any romance in you ? MAN : Sure , I had it , but I got rid of it . BERT : Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon ? What we want is romantic places , beautiful places . places George wants to go . He 's coming ! MAN : Who ? BERT : The groom , idiot ! This is their honeymoon . MAN : What are they , ducks ? - Get that ready . - AII right , all right . - Hurry up ! - I 'm hurrying ' ! ERNIE : Hiya , Geo - - Good evening , sir . Entrez , monsieur . Entrez .  welcome home , Mr . bailey . GEORGE : well , I'II ... Mary , where did you -- BERT AND ERNIE :  I Iove you truly . truly , dear . Life with its shadow ... GEORGE : Oh , Mary . BERT AND ERNIE : Life with its tear . Remember the night we broke some windows in this old house ? This is what I wished for . GEORGE : You 're wonderful . BERT AND ERNIE : I Iove you truly . truly , dear . MAN : Martini , you rented a new house ? MARTINI : Rent ?  You hear what he say , Mr . No more we live like pigs in Potter 's field . GEORGE : Mary , bring the baby . GEORGE : I'II take the kids in the car . MARTINI : Thank you , Mr . bailey . GEORGE : AII right , kids . Get in here . One at a time . Get up in the seat . MARY : Sit down , honey . You must be careful . MARY : I'II hold it . GEORGE : AII in ? MARTINI :  sole mio ... Stanfronte a te ... O sole mio . GEORGE : Mr . and Mrs . Martini , welcome home . SAM : Look at old George . He 's always making a speech . Hee-haw ! GEORGE : That 's Sam Wainwright . MARY : Oh , who cares ? Bread . That this house may never know hunger . salt . That life may always have flavor . GEORGE : And wine . That joy and prosperity may reign forever . Enter the Martini castle . REINEMAN : Mr ... but you ca n't laugh off this bailey Park anymore .  SECRETARY : Congressman BIatz is here , sir . POTTER : tell the congressman to wait . Go on . REINEMAN : 15 years ago ... a half dozen houses here and there . squirrels , buttercups , daisies . I used to hunt rabbits there myself . Look at it today . Dozens of the prettiest little homes ... 90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you . Your Potter 's field is becoming just that . The local yokels ... are making with those David and goliath wisecracks . POTTER : Even though they know ... the baileys never made a dime out of it ? REINEMAN : The BaiIeys were all chumps . Every home is worth twice ... what it cost the building and Loan to build . If I were you -- POTTER : You are not me . REINEMAN : It 's no skin off my nose . But one day , this bright young man ... will ask George bailey for a job . SAM : We stopped at the new factory ... then we 're driving to florida . WOMAN : Have them join us . SAM : Sure . Why do n't you drive down with us ? GEORGE : Oh , I 'm afraid I could n't get away , Sam . SAM : still got the nose to the grindstone . I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics ... and he turned me down . GEORGE : Do n't rub it in . SAM : I guess we 'd better run along . WOMAN : Happy to have met you , Mary . SAM : So long , George . MARY : Bye , Sam . Have fun ! GEORGE : Thanks for dropping around . - Hee-haw ! - Hee-haw ! GEORGE : Thank you , sir . That 's quite a cigar . POTTER : You like it ? I'II send you a box . GEORGE : well , I , uh ... I suppose I'II find out sooner or later ... I am an old man , and most people hate me ... but I do n't like them either , so that makes it all even . You know just as well as I do ... that I run practically everything in this town ... but the bailey building and Loan . You know I 've been trying to get control or kill it ... but I have n't been able to do it . You have been stopping me . In fact , you have beaten me ... and as anyone can tell you , that takes some doing . Take during the Depression , for instance . You and I were the only one's that kept our heads . You saved the building and Loan . I saved all the rest . Most people say you stole all the rest . POTTER : The envious one's say that - - the suckers . Now , I have stated my side very frankly . Let 's look at your side . A young man ... Forty-five . POTTER : Forty-five . Out of which , after supporting your mother ... and paying your bills ... you 're able to keep , say , 10 , if you skimp . A child or two comes along ... and you wo n't be able to save the 10 . If this young man of 28 was an ordinary yokeI ... I 'd say he was doing fine ... but George bailey is not an ordinary yokeI . He is an intelligent , smart , ambitious young man ... who hates his job , who hates the building and Loan ... . almost as much as I do . A young man who 's been dying to get out on his own ... ever since he was born . A young man - - the smartest one in the crowd ... who has to sit by and watch his friends go places ... because he 's trapped into frittering his life away ... playing nursemaid to a Iot of garlic eaters . Hire me ? POTTER : I want you to run my properties . George , I'II start you out at $20,000 a year . $20,000 a year ? You would n't mind living in the nicest house in town ... buying your wife a Iot of fine clothes ... a couple of business trips to New York a year ... maybe once in a while , Europe ? You would n't mind that , would you ? would I ? You 're not talking to somebody else , are you ? This is me . Remember me ? George bailey . George bailey , right . George bailey , whose ship has just come in ... provided he has enough brains to climb aboard . holy mackerel . well , how about the building and Loan ? Oh , confound it ! Are you afraid of success ? I 'm offering you a three-years contract ... at $20,000 a year starting today . Is it a deal or is n't it ? Mr ... twenty-four hours to think it over ? Sure , sure , sure . Go on home and talk about it to your wife . GEORGE : I 'd Iike to do that . POTTER : In the meantime , I'II draw up the papers . OK , George ? OK , Mr . Potter . GEORGE : Now , wait a minute here . I do n't need 24 hours or to talk to anybody . I know right now . The answer is no ! You sit around here and spin your webs ... and you think the world revolves around you . well , it does n't , Mr . Potter . In the vast configuration of things ... I 'd say you 're nothing but a scurvy spider . And that goes for you , too ! And it goes for you , too ! POTTER : You would n't mind ... living in the nicest house in town ... buying your wife a Iot of fine clothes ... going on a couple of business trips to New York ..... and next year and the year after that . I 'm shaking the dust of this town off my feet ... and I 'm going to see the world . Then I'II build things -- I'II build airfields . Skyscrapers 100 stories high . A bridge a mile long . What is it you want , Mary ? You want the moon ? Say the word ... I'II throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you . MARY :  buffalo gal , wo n't you come out tonight ? Wo n't you come out tonight ? Wo n't you come out tonight ? buffalo gal , wo n't you come out tonight ... And ... - Hi . - Hi . Mary Hatch ... Why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me ? MARY : To keep from being an old maid . GEORGE : You could have married Sam Wainwright ... and anybody else in town . MARY : I did n't want to marry anybody else in town . I promised you - - Your what ? MARY : My baby . GEORGE : Your b - - your - - your ... Mary , you on the nest ? MARY : George bailey Iassos stork . GEORGE : Lassos a stork ? well ... You mean , y-you 're ... What is it , a boy or a girl ? MARY : Mm-hmm . JOSEPH : Now you 've probably already guessed ... that George never leaves Bedford falls . CLARENCE : No . JOSEPH : Mary had her baby , a boy . Then she had another one , a girl . Day after day , she worked ... remaking the old GranviIIe house into a home . Night after night ... George came back late from the office . JOSEPH : Potter was bearing down hard . JOSEPH : Then came a war . Ma bailey and Mrs . Hatch ... joined the Red Cross and sewed . Mary had two more babies ... but found time to run the USO . POTTER : 1-A . 1-A . 1-A . JOSEPH : Gower and uncle billy sold war bonds . Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa . Got the silver Star . Ernie the taxi driver parachuted into France . Marty helped capture the Remagen bridge . Harry ? Harry bailey topped them all . A Navy flier , he shot down 15 planes ... two of them as they were about to crash ... into a transport full of soldiers . CLARENCE : Yes , but George ? JOSEPH : George ? 4-F on account of his ear ... George fought the battle of Bedford falls . GEORGE : hold on ! hold on now ! Do n't you know there 's a war on ? JOSEPH : Air raid warden ...  JOSEPH : Paper drives , scrap drives ... rubber drives . Like everybody else ... on V-E Day , he wept and prayed . On V-J Day , he wept and prayed again . FRANKLIN : Joseph , now show him what happened today . JOSEPH : Yes , sir ... GEORGE : Hey , Ernie , look at that . ERNIE : It 's going to snow again . GEORGE : What do you mean ? Look at the headline ! ERNIE : I know , George , and it 's marvelous . GEORGE : Commander Harry bailey . Mr . Gower , look at this . This is for you . That 's for you . See you again . BILLY : Hey ! Be sure you spell the name right . GEORGE : Yeah ! Extra ! Read all about it . EUSTACE : George , it 's Harry from Washington . He reversed the charges . It 's OK , is n't it ? GEORGE : Reversed the charges ? Of course . For a hero ? Harry , you old son of a gun , congratulations . How 's Mother standing it ? What do you know ? Mother had lunch with the president 's wife . TILLY : Wait till Martha hears about this . EUSTACE : In a plane ? GEORGE : What ? uncle billy . Has uncle billy come in yet ? TILLY : He stopped at the bank . GEORGE : He 's not here right now -- EUSTACE : George , that man is here again . - What man ? - Bank examiner . GEORGE : Harry , talk to Eustace for a minute . I'II be right back . Good morning , sir . Carter , bank examiner . Mr . Carter , Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - We 're excited around here . My brother got the congressional medal of Honor . The president just decorated him . CARTER : I guess they do those things . I trust you had a good year . GEORGE : Good year ? Between you and me , Mr . Carter , we 're broke . CARTER : Very funny . GEORGE : Ahem . Come in here , Mr . Carter . CARTER : I should n't wonder when you OK reverse charges ... on personal Iong-distance calls . He wants to talk to uncle billy .

BILLY : December 24 . 8,000 . MEN : Merry Christmas , Mr . Potter ! BILLY : Good morning , Mr . Potter . What 's the news ? well , well , well . ' ? Harry bailey wins congressional medal . ' ? That would n't be one of the bailey boys ? You just ca n't keep those BaiIeys down . POTTER : How does slacker George feel about that ? BILLY : Very jealous . He only lost three buttons off his vest . George would have gotten two if he had gone . POTTER : Bad ear . BILLY : Some people like George had to stay home . Not every heel was in Germany and Japan . HORACE : Good morning , Mr . bailey . BILLY : Good morning . - What ? - Are n't you making a deposit ? BILLY : Sure . Sure I am . HORACE : It 's customary to bring the money with you . BILLY : Oh , shucks . I ... I , uh ... HORACE : How about that finger ? POTTER : bailey . Take me back there . Hurry up . Come on . Look sharp . Take me back . GEORGE : Make yourself at home .

No securities , no stocks , no bonds - - nothing but a miserable little $500 equity ... in a life insurance policy . Hee hee ! You 're worth more dead than alive . Why do n't you go to the riffraff you love so much ... and ask them to let you have 8,000 ? You know why ? Because they 'd run you out of town on a rail . But I'II tell you what I 'm going to do for you . Since the state examiner is still here ... AII right , George , go ahead . You ca n't hide in a little town like this . Yeah , bill ?

Not young girls . I have a team ! You have a limp . No one else will help you . Hammerhead said it . The mission is too dangerous and ... you have too little to pay . And you ... you do not fear it ? No . - Should I ? - Yes . 200 silver pieces ... full sum upon completion . It will be dangerous . But with a care , a man just might survive it . You wo n't regret it . We meet at the stone circle , at dawn . I know you . You 're that slave girl that got me thrown into this cage . Marek . That pimp has some influential friends in my regiment . I 'm here to free you . All I need is for you to swear an oath to me . Why not ? I need a swordsman , for a bounty . Join me and we 'll win it together . You 're joking ! You 're not joking . Long ago , I swore an oath , to the Vitalian Empire . That oath , took me across the world , and into this cage . I 'm done with oaths . I saw you in the alley . You ... you 're a brave man . - I would n't go that far . - No more masters , no magistrates ! We-we 'll create our own destinies . And what would those destinies hold for us , little varmint ? A life with dignity . Well , friend ... for a life of dignity ... Maybe one of them has the key ! Reckless balls ... ! Name 's Thane . We need a thief . It 's Thor 's day . I believe there 's one coupling with my commander 's wife . Well , there 's our thief . Pssst ! Boy ! Boy ! Boy ! Go around the corner and tell the guards you saw a man climb into that window . What 's on your leg ? Go ! What is that on your leg ? Oh ! My husband 's back ! Take these ! Go ! Go ! Go ! No-no-no ! Do n't hurt me ! What is that thing on your foot ? Where 's my money ? - I have no idea what you 're talking about . - In the hay wagon . I meet a lot of women in the hay . No offense , but , I ... ca n't say as I remember you , sweetheart ! Wait , it 's coming to me . What manner of insult is it you bring to me ? ! Can we maybe discuss this somewhere else ? Take your time , pal . Alright ... alright . Given my very ... limited ... knowledge on thieves , I would assume you money is gone . Gambled away , or spent on very , very expensive women . You bastard ! Most probably . I 'm sorry , sweetheart . I 'm a harder catch than that . We 're here to make you an offer . Guads ! Guards ! I can just ... I need you for one mission . No chance , milady . Then we 'll let the magistrate have you , and she keeps her clothes . - What 's the pay ? - 50 silver . 100 ! - 100 ! - Is now really the time to haggle ? - 75 . - What ? - Have him destroyed ! - I 'm in ! We 're here . Weh-heh-heh-hell , well ... allow me ! Dagen . - And you are ? - Teela , from the order of Anisette . A holy woman ? ! Charming . There is an Orc encampment 10 leagues east . My sister is held there . We will rescue her under cover of night . You and I , under the covers , at night ? I like it . Except without the dress . All done up in ... why do n't you stick out like a lily in a pile of pig shite ? - Done . Up ! - Should we head out ? My white robes symbolize purity and show my dedication to the goddess , Anisette . And I will not be spoken to like one of your common whores . Speak to ladies like whores , and whores , like ladies . Surprising what you get from both . I 've ten leagues , yet , before I test this blade . Do n't push me off . The goddess leads us . " The goddess leads us . " Ten leagues . Maybe we should take a look around , down there . See if they ... missed anything valuable . What is that smell ? We 're to stay downwind . Keep low ... and quiet . That 's a lot of orcs . Right . Time to go home . If we fight , we die . I have a plan . I 'll create a distraction . The meadow . Draw them out that way . Get them to chase us . - Then Dagen will run in and ... - Oh , hey , no ! Like hell I will ! You out of your nut ? Those are n't imaginary Orcs that your grandmother told you about , to lull you to sleep , sweetheart . Those are real , bloodthirsty , musclebound animals . And we only have one musclebound animal . I can conjure a distraction . There 's a lot of Orcs down there . Fine ! Well , then , thief , you 're going to slip into the water , quietly ... hop into those cages and find out which one has Teela 's sister in it . - Mmm . - Forget it ! - If anything happens , we 'll attack ... causing a distraction . It 's a good plan . Naturally ! And what about that guard , down there by the cages ? Maybe I 'll make friends with him . All the while , Thane can spend the night , up here , on the rocks , pleasuring you lovely ladies , while Teela 's sex deprived goddess watches on , with envy . Shove your dagger straight up through his bowels . He wo n't scream and death is instant . The sisters of my order study principles of combat . - Dagen , if your thieving skills are n't up to it . - My thieving skills ? No-no-no-no-no . It 's fine . I 'll do it . Fyke ! Always the thief gets the sodden end of the stick ! Teela , cut that out ! What 's she look like , this sister of yours ? - Brown hair . - Is she beautiful ? Chances are improving . What 's going on down there ? Teela , is that your sister ? No , a priest . That 's him . He led the raid on my temple . - Where is the stone ? - I do n't know . What is he doing to him ? Necromancy . It 's an old , dark magic , which draws on the life of survivors . I 'd only ever heard tales of it , until now . I ca n't see Dagen . Any sign of him ? Come on , thief , earn your pay . Which one of you is Teela 's sister , Caeryn ? They kill those of us who speak . I mean to free you . - The Ogre came and he took ... - Silence ! Or my blade shall taste of your blood , again ! So , what have we got , here ? Put it in ... easy , easy ... Let 's have a look at you . You 're Caeryn ? Caeryn is n't here . - What do you mean ? - I misunderstood . Goddess wants all of her worshipers released . They 'll see we 've escaped and come after us . Ohh ... oh , no . Fyke ! Do n't do it . Alright . Alright . They 've got him . No-no ! Come on down whenever you 're ready ! It 's going in ! Do we have a plan ? We fight . I thought you said we 'd die . We 'll see now , wo n't we ? It is a lot of Orcs . Are you alright ? Of course I 'm not alright ! Help Teela ! You had to fyeking stab me . Teela , your combat training is shite ! Leave us your women and you can live . How very Orkish of you . Leave me ! I 'm not afraid to die . Just do it , already . You had to fyeking stab me . Must have lost them . - Just leave me ! I 'm slowing you down ! - No ! Our oath goes both ways ! Move him faster , or drop him ! Wait , wait ! I know this place ! Up there , we raided a camp here , once . There 's a cave . It 's hard to get to . I 'm out of arrows ! Hard to get to ? I 'm not gon na let you die ! The bolt ! Pull the bolt ! - I 'm alright ! - OK . Keep him quiet ! Shhh ! Quiet ! I 'm bleeding too fast ! Move aside . Embrace the pain and welcome death , should she beckon you . No ! No ! I could n't get it all . It 'll take time to fully heal you . But you will live . You are so beautiful . Sleep now . I will watch over you . Thank you . Thank you . I 'm going to see what else is in here . It 's Faltic . How do you know that ? Personal experience , I 'm afraid . It 's far too pretty a thing for this place . I do n't even know where we are . What is this , a house ? Ah , no . No , it 's a-it 's a runner 's cache . Daring smugglers used to keep them up and down the trade routes . It 's long forgotten . But , um ... might wish we asked to go through them ... being a slave in them . No , I ju ... um , I just , uh ... saw the-the mark on your ... neck . Explains a lot . I 'm going to make a fire . Well , Teela . I presume the mission 's over ? Unless , of course , you have some idea as to where your sister might actually be . My sister might have been taken by the Ogre . - The Ogre ? - Oh , yes , THE Ogre . A little-or should I say , a HUGE detail that Teela left out . It 's probably why she did n't want us to go down there . We 'd have - noticed all the evidence ... - No ! - I mean , I did n't know the goddess led us to ... - Oh , the goddess be damned ! I did my part , whether your sister was there or not ! Now I want my silver and then , I 'll be going . I do not have your silver . - Ah ! - Not yet . Well , that 's perfect , is n't it ? The goddess has promised to provide you with payment . OK . I 'm done with you lot . I know , in my heart , that my sister is alive . I still have to find her ! Yeah , well ... good luck with that , priestess . Dagen , wait ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm leaving . - This mission is suicide ... if you like . I want to see this through . - Take care of Thane . - Wait ! Teela ? No . I 'm sorry . Nothing has changed . My promise is good . One bounty . We leave at dawn . Teela ? You should rest . I 've no need . Nor I . Sleep does n't come so easily , now . Before this , I would sleep like a babe . This is very clever . Teela ... you 're a healer . Are you able to heal ... anyone ? Those with ... pure intent , who have faith to heal and be healed ... yes . Am I pure enough ? C- can your goddess ... can she heal me ... my ... my leg ? Please ? I 'm sorry , Marek . It is not the will of the goddess . What ? Why ? Why ? Your leg ... it 's a deliberate mark , from the gods . A reminder of the darkness inside you . I 'm good ! We all harbor darkness ... and all light . Then why am I different ? And why ca n't I be healed ? How recent do you think this Ogre trail is ? Less than a day , I 'd wager . - Are Vitalian soldiers trained in tracking ? - Aye . But men ... not Ogres . Why become a soldier ? A chance to see the world ... and swing a sword at it . And you ? - Why did I chose the order of Anisette ? - Aye . It was my sister , who was first called . Greatly upsetting our father . I promised I would never follow in her footsteps . Nor did I desire to . Then , I found out he planned to trade me to a nobleman for a tract of land . I refused and ran to Caeryn and the order . The goddess has been my life , since . Not many girls would pass up a chance to marry a nobleman . I refused to be traded like property . Life is bleak . The imprint is deeper here . And lengthened ... the Ogre was running . - Running ? For what ? - From what ? I have little experience with these creatures . Following blindly ... is reckless . What do you suggest ? I say we get up high ... spy out the land . Learn what ... might be waiting for us . We do n't have time . If your sister 's still alive ... there 's no telling how much longer she has . We have the trail , let 's keep going . Orcs . He chose his own path . He may have been taken captive . He 's likely still alive . Maybe . The goddess has her purposes . Dagen 's fate is no longer our concern . I 've heard enough of your damned goddess ! What good is she to me , to you , to anyone ? Maybe Dagen had it right . Your temple is burned . Your sister is probably dead ... for you and your goddess , to care about , but I know this . I 'm not like your goddess . I would n't leave a friend to die , alone , in the wilderness . The same way Dagen left us ? - What was that ? - We need to move . Now ! We need to find a clearing ! We 'll have a better chance of fighting , if we can see it . Go on ! Do n't look in his eyes ! - Blind me ! I have looked directly into his eyes ! - Do we keep running or make a stand ? ! Keep running ! - I thought we needed to find a clearing ? ! - I 'm trying ! Stop playing around ! Marek , run ! - What was that ? - I do n't wan na know . There 's a clearing ahead ! We should have scouted . Into the trees ! Leave me , I can make it ! Put me down ! Put me dow ... Over here , you brute ! Pretty ! Marek ! Forget about us ! You must find the stone ! The goddess leads you ! Why wo n't you heal me ? Anisette , hear my prayer . I have failed you , goddess . My friends are going to die . I was alone . I was alone . I 'm alone . Heal me . Heal me , so I can save my friends ! Anisette , if you hear me , answer . If you hear me ... answer . Answer me . Answer me . Answer me ! Answer me . You 're wrong ! You 're wrong about me . To hell with the gods ! What about a last meal , or something ? Some meat ? Ale would be nice . Thanks very much . Marek . Thanks for it . Quiet ... I 'm concentrating . Thank you ... very much . Do n't mind me , I 'm just a bit foxy . You have impeccable timing , Marek . This is yours . Oh , ho-ho-ho ! Oh , my God ! And I thought you 'd deserted me ! Where are the others ? You left them ? - Smart . - No . We 're going to rescue them . The Ogre ? Fyke , Marek ! Why ? Because they 're our friends . And I do n't have many friends . And neither do you . I spotted the Ogre trail , not far from here . It 's just over that ridge . Alright . Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! - Yes , alright . - Is this the Ogre 's cave ? I 'd bet my magic wand we 're at his doorstep . You know , you 're asking the impossible , right ? Surely not impossible for you . I just want to make sure you 'll appreciate my success . - What was that for ? - I 'm probably falling in love . Who 's out there ? Is there someone there ? Please ! Are you here to help me ? ! Is there anyone there ? I-I hear you . Is that someone out there ? Who 's there ? Who 's there ? I 'm in here ! I 'm in here ! Psst ! Anybody home ? Who are you ? Just ... get me out of here . Shhh , sh-sh-sh . Calm down , boy . Is there anyone else in there with you ? A tiresome priestess , maybe ? No . I'm-I 'm all alone . Alright , just ... sit tight . Please ! You have to save me ! Please ! Please ! Get me out of here ! Do n't ... do n't leave me ! Where did you go ? Come back ! Come back ! Please ! Please , help ! Hello , beautiful . I 'm Dagen . Your insane sister sent me here to rescue you . - I 'm not important . Take this . - Please , get me out of here ! Take the stone . Bring it to the Paladins at Sung Hill . They can protect it . Listen , sweetheart ... Come back , please ! Please , get me out of here ! Shut it ! You fool ! Escape with the stone ! Nothing else matters ! You remind me a lot of your sister . Go ! It 's coming ! Let 's go and get out here ! It 's coming ! Let me go ! Ahh ! Ahhhh ! Ahh ! Dagen move ! Did you two want to quit lying around and give me a hand ? Dagen . By the gods , never thought I 'd be happy to see you again . Yeah , well , I was missing Teela 's sunny demeanor . - Where 's Marek ? - She 's here . We 're going to get you out of here . Ready , push ! OK , OK . I 'm , uh ... - Uhh ... - Maybe we could the ... Ogre to ... He does n't take them out to play with them , he takes them out to eat them . I have an idea . Anisette , be merciful . Hang on to each other ... tightly . Ready ? Hold on , Teela , I 've got you . Marek . - What was that ? - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - It was the only way . I did n't mean ... - Yeah , well , it worked ... but , never do it again . Did you find Caeryn ? Caeryn ? - Yeah , together , we might be able to move it . - Yeah , Yeah . Push ! - Sister ! - She 's out . She 's out . I 'm gon na need something sharp ! This way ! Come on ! That way ! Come on . Come on . Come on . I feel fresh air moving ! This must be another way out . I see a light . This way ! Get out , get out ! Think you can make it ? Probably , but how are we gon na get the rest of you out ? Help him . You wan na eat us ? You 'll have to crawl in after us . We 're not coming out . I 'm not so sure about that ! Here come the spiders ! I 'm out of arrows ! Quickly ... before it recovers ! Oh , come on ! There 's the entrance ! We can make it if we run ! Well done , wizard . Is everyone alright ? You did it . We did it . Are you kidding ? There 's no treasure ! I have always heard ... that Ogres ... amass hordes and hordes of treasure . That belongs to the temple . We must hurry . This country is unsafe , at night . At night ? Hardly imagine anything worse ... than this country , during the day . How much for an Ogre 's ear ? An Ogre 's ear , you say ? I 'd say that 's worth ... a free drink ... and a smidgen of respect . Done ! I wo n't stop until I 've reached the monastery . Why must you travel alone ? My path is sure . I have no fear . And the goddess says you are to stay here for the time being . I must take the stone to the Paladin . Farewell , my sister . Now , go . Be with your friends . I said , you take that staff and you give it to the captain ... he knows right where to ... Maybe I 'll ... become a farmer ? - Find a soft woman to settle down with . - Oh . To adventure ! - To a life of dignity . - To riches and gold ! 
@@5215641 Long ago , in the far away land of ancient Greece ... there was a golden age of powerful gods ... and extraordinay heroes . And the greatest and strongest of all these heroes ... was the mighty Hercules . But what is the measure of a true hero ? Ah , that is what our story is ... Will you listen to him ?

Ah Back when the world was new - Whoa ! - The planet Earth was down on its luck And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok It was a nasty place There was a mess wherever you stepped Where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept Whoo ! Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth Though , honey it may seem impossible That 's the gospel truth On Mount Olympus life was neat And smooth as sweet vermouth Although , honey it may seem impossible That 's the gospel truth - Ah , ah - Ah - Ah , ah - Oh , yeah , yeah - Ah , ah - Hey , hey , hey - Ah , ah - Hey , yeah Hercules !

We 're not supposed to reveal the future . Oh , wait . I 'm sorry . Time out . Can I ... Can I ask you a question by the way ? Are you ... Did you cut your hair or something ? You look fabulous . Ladies , please . My fate ... is in your lovely hands . - Oh . - Oh , all right . In 18 years precisely ... the planets will align ... ever so nicely . Ay , verse . Oy . The time to act will be at hand . Unleash the Titans , your monstrous band . Mm-hmm . Good , good . Then the once-proud Zeus will finally fall ... and you , Hades ... will rule all ! Yes !

Amphityon , for so many years ... we 've prayed to the gods to bless us with a child . Perhaps they 've answered our prayers . Perhaps they have . " Hercules " ? Help , help , help ! Hades is gon na kill us when he finds out what happened . You mean , if he finds out . Zeus led all the gods on a frantic search . But by the time they found the baby , it was too late . - Young Herc was mortal now - Mmm But since he did not drink the last drop He still retained his godlike strength - So thank his lucky stars - Tell it , girl . - But Zeus and Hera wept - Ooh , ooh , ooh Because their son could never come home They 'd have to watch their precious baby Grow up from a far Though Hades ' horrid plan Was hatched before Herc cut his first tooth - Ahh - The boy grew stronger everyday And that 's the gospel truth The gospel truth Hercules , slow down ! Look out ! Oops ! S-S-sorry , guys ! - Hey , watch where you 're goin ' ! - Sunday driver ! Thanks , son . When old Penelope twisted her ankle back there , I thought we were done for . - No problem , Pop . - Uh , don't-don't-do n't unload just yet . sorry , Penelope .

Five is n't an ev ... - See ya , Herc . - What a geek ! - Destructo Boy . - Maybe we should call him " Jerkules " . - Yeah ! Heads up ! It 's okay . Hey ! Whoa ! - Son ! - Hang on , Pop !

That boy is a menace ! He 's too dangerous to be around normal people ! He did n't mean any harm . He 's just a kid . He-He just ca n't control his strength . I 'm warning you . You keep that-that-that ... freak away from here ! Freak ! Yeah , go away ! Son , you should n't let those things they said back there get to ya . But , Pop , they 're right . I-I am a freak . I-I try to fit in . I really do . I just ca n't . Sometimes I feel like ... like I really do n't belong here ..... I know it does n't make any sense . I have often dreamed Of a far-offplace Where a great , warm welcome will be waiting for me Where the crowds will cheer When they see my face And a voice keeps sayin ' this is where I 'm meant to be I will find my way I can go the distance I 'll be there someday If I can be strong I know every mile Will be worth my while I would go most anywhere to feel like I Belong Hercules , there 's something your mother and I ... have been meaning to , to tell ya . But if you found me , then where did I come from ? Why was I left here ? This was around your neck when we found you . It 's the symbol of the gods . This is it ! Do n't you see ? Maybe they have the answers . I 'll go to the temple of Zeus and ... Ma , Pop ... you 're the greatest parents anyone could have , but ..... please , hear me and , and answer my prayer . I need to know : Who am I ? Wh-Where do I belong ? Huh ? My boy . My little Hercules . Hey , hey , hey . Hold on , kiddo ! What 's your hurry ? After all these years ... is this the kind of hello you give your father ? F-F-Father ? Did n't know you had a famous father , did you ? Surprise ! Look how you 've grown . Why , you 've got your mother 's beautiful eyes ... and my strong chin . - Hah ! - I-I do n't understand . If you 're my father , that would make me a ... A god . A god . A god ! Hey , you wanted answers , and by thunder ... Your mother and I loved you with all our hearts . But someone stole you from us and turned you mortal ... and only gods can live on Mount Olympus . And you ca n't do a thing ? I ca n't , Hercules , but you can . R-Really ? W-What ? I 'll do anything . Hercules , if you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth ... your godhood will be restored . A true hero . Great ! Uh , exactly how do you become a true hero ? First , you must seek out Philoctetes , the trainer of heroes . Seek out Philoctetes . Right . I 'll ... - Whoa ! - Whoa ! Hold your horses ! Which reminds me . Ha-ha ! You probably do n't remember Pegasus ... but you two go way back , son . Oh , Pegasus ! He 's a magnificent horse ... with the brain of a bird . I 'll find Philoctetes , become a true hero ! Yee-hah ! Good luck , son . I will beat the odds I can go the distance I will face the world Fearless , proud and strong I will please the gods I can go the distance Till I find my hero 's welcome Right where I Belong Whoa ! - You sure this is the right place ? - What 's the matter , little guy ? You stuck ? - Whoa ! Hey , butt out , buddy ! - Ugh ! Girls ! Stop ! Stop ! Come back ! Come back , come back ! Whoa , whoa ! Oh , jeez ! Wait ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Oh , nymphs ! - They ca n't keep their hands off me . - Hey ! What 's the matter ? You never seen a satyr before ? Uh , no . Can you help us ? We 're looking for someone called Philoctetes . - Call me Phil . - Phil ! - Ow ! - Boy , am I glad to meet you ! I want to become a hero , a true hero . sorry , kid . Ca n't help ya . - Wait . - Whoo ! Uh , sorry . Why not ? Two words : I am retired . Look , I got ta do this . Have n't you ever had a dream ... something you wanted so bad you 'd do anything ? Kid , come inside . I want to show you somethin ' . Watch it ! That was part of the mast of the Argo . - The Argo ? - Yeah . Who do you think taught Jason how to sail ? Cleopatra ? I trained all those would-be heroes . Odysseus , Perseus , Theseus . A lot of " yeuseus " . And every single one of those bums let me down ... flatter than a discus . None of_'em could go the distance . And then there was Achilles . Now there was a guy who had it all ... the build , the foot speed . He could jab . He could take a hit . He barely gets nicked there once and kaboom ! He 's history . Yeah , I had a dream once . I dreamed I was gon na train the greatest hero there ever was . So great , the gods would hang a picture of him in the stars ... all across the sky ... and people would say , " That 's Phil 's boy " . That 's right . Eh , but dreams are for rookies . A guy can only take so much disappointment . But I 'm different than those other guys , Phil . I can go the distance . Come on . I 'll show ya . Jeez . You do n't give up , do ya ? Watch this .

Did you see that ? Next stop , Olympus . All right . Just take it easy , champ . I am ready . I want to get off this island . I want to see battles and monsters . Rescue some damsels . You know , heroic stuff . - Well . - Aw , come on , Phil ! Well , okay , okay . You want a road test ? Saddle up , kid . - We 're goin ' to Thebes ! - Ya-hoo ! - So what 's in Thebes ? - A lot of problems . It 's a big , tough town . Good place to start buildin ' a rep . Sounds like your basic DID ... - Hyah ! - Damsel in distress ! Not so fast , sweetheart . I swear , Nessus . Put me down or I 'll ... Whoo ! Do n't just barrel in there without thinking . Eh ?

And by the way , sweet cheeks . I 'm real too . Ugh ! Yee-hah ! Ya-hoo ! Whoa ! - How was that , Phil ? - Reign it in , rookie . You can get away with mistakes like those in the minor decathlons ... but this is the big leagues ! At least I beat him , did n't I ? Next time , do n't let your guard down because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes ! D-oh ! It 's like I keep tellin ' ya . You got ta stay focused , and you ... Are you , uh , all right , Miss , uh ... Megara . My friends call me Meg ... - Uh , uh ... - Are you always this articulate ? Hercules . My ... My name is Hercules . Herc ... Huh . I think I prefer Wonderboy . So , uh , uh ... How-how-how 'd you get mixed up with the , uh ... Pinhead with hooves ? Well , you know how men are . They think " No " means " Yes " and " Get lost " means " Take me . I 'm yours " . Do n't worry . Shorty here can explain it to ya later . Well , thanks for everything , Herc . It 's been a real slice . Wait ! Um , can we give you a ride ? Uh , I do n't think your pinto likes me very much . Pegasus ? Oh , no . Do n't be silly . He 'd be more than happy to ... Ow ! I 'll be all right . Bye . She 's somethin ' . Is n't she , Phil ? Yeah , ye ... Oh , yeah . She 's really somethin ' . A real pain in the patella ! Earth to Herc ! Come in , Herc ! Come in , Herc ! We got a job to do , remember ? Thebes is still waitin ' . Yeah . Yeah . I know . Aw , how cute . A couple of rodents lookin ' for a theme park . Who you callin ' a rodent , sister ? - I 'm a bunny ! - A-And I 'm his gopher ! Ta-dah ! I thought I smelled a rat . - Meg . - Speak of the devil . Meg , my little flower , my little bird , my little nut . Meg . What exactly happened here ? I thought you were gon na persuade the river guardian to join my team ... for the uprising , and here I am , kind of river guardian-less ... hey , I 'm gon na add two on , okay ? - Give that your best shot . - Look . It was n't my fault . It was this wonderboy , Hercules . Hercules . Why does that name ring a bell ? I do n't know . Um , maybe we owe him money ? - What was that name again ? - Hercules . He comes on with this big , innocent farm boy routine ... but I could see through that in a Peloponnesian minute . Wait a minute . Was n't Hercules the name of that kid we were supposed to ... Oh , my gods ! Run for it ! So you took care of him , huh ? Dead as a doornail . Were n't those your exact words ? This might be a different Hercules . Yeah ! I mean , Hercules is a very popular name nowadays ! Remember , like , a few years ago , every other boy was named Jason ..... is waltzing around in the woods ! Wait . Wait , big guy . - We can still cut in on his waltzing . - That 's right . And-And at least we made him mortal . That 's a good thing . Did n't we ? Hmm . Fortunately for the three of you ... we still have time to correct this rather egregious oversight . And this time , no foul-ups . Wow ! - Is that all one town ? - One town , a million troubles . The one and only Thebes . The Big Olive itself . If you can make it there , you can make it anywhere . Stick with me , kid . The city is a dangerous place . - Look where you 're goin ' , numbskull ! - Hey , I 'm walkin ' here ! See what I mean ? I 'm tellin ' you . Wackos . Pita bread . Pita bread . Get your pita bread here . - Hey , Mack . The end is coming ! Ca n't you feel it ? Yes , yes . Thank you for the info . Yes . We 'll ponder that for awhile . Just stare at the sidewalk . Come on . Do n't make eye contact . People here are nuts . That 's because they live in a city of turmoil . Trust me , kid . You 're gon na be just what the doctor ordered . It was tragic ! We lost everything in the fire . everything except old Snowball here . Now were the fires before or after the earthquake ? They were after the earthquake . I remember . But before the flood . Do n't even get me started on the crime rate . Thebes has certainly gone downhill in a hurry . Tell me about it . It seems like every time I turn around ... there 's some new monster wreaking ' havoc and I ... All we need now is a plague of locusts . That 's it !.. seems to me that what you folks need is a hero . Yeah , and who are you ? I 'm Hercules , and , uh ... I happen to be a hero . - Is that so ? - A hero ! Have you ever saved a town before ? Uh , no . Uh , not exactly , but I ... Have you ever reversed a natural disaster ? Well , uh , no . Oh , listen to thi ... He 's just another chariot chaser . This we need . That 's a laugh . - Do n't you pea brains get it ? - Hmm ? This kid is the genuine article . Hey , is n't that the goat-man who trained Achilles ? Watch it , pal . Yeah , you 're right . Hey , uh , nice job on those heels ! Ya missed a spot ! You ... I got your heel right here ! I 'll wipe that stupid grin off your face ! You ... Hey , Phil ! Phil ! Phil !.. not an amateur . Well , wait . Stop ! How am I supposed to prove myself a hero ... if nobody will give me a chance ? You 'll get your chance . You just need some kind of catastrophe or disaster . Please . Help ! Please ! There 's been a terrible accident ! - Meg ? - Speakin ' of disasters . Wonderboy ! Hercules ! - Thank goodness . - Wha-Wha-What 's wrong ? Oh ! Outside of town . Two little boys . Th-They were playing in the gorge . Th-There was this rock slide , a terrible rock slide . - They 're trapped ! - Kids ? Trapped ? Phil , this is great ! You 're really choked up about this , are n't ya ? - Come on ! - No , I ... You do n't under ... I , I have this terrible fear of heights ! I 'm right behind ya , kid ! Whoo ! I 'm way behind ya , kid . I got a fur wedgie . Help ! I ca n't breathe ! - Hurry ! - Get us out ! We 're suffocating ! Somebody call IX-I-I ! Easy , fellas . You 'll be all right . We ca n't last much longer ! Get us out before we get crushed ! - How you boys doin ' ? - We 're okay now . Jeepers , mister . You 're really strong . Well , just ty to be a little more careful next time , okay , kids ? We sure will . Stirring performance , boys . I was really moved . " Jeepers , mister " ? I was going for innocence . And , hey , two thumbs way , way up for our leading lady . What a dish . What a doll . Get outta there , ya big lug , while ya still can . Phil , I-I did great . They even applauded . Sort of . Huh ! I hate to burst your bubble , kid ... but that ai n't applause . Let 's get ready to rumble ! That 's it . Dance around ! Dance around ! Watch the teeth ! Watch the teeth ! Keep going . Come on . Come on . Lead with your left . Lead with your left . Your other left ! Whoa ! All right ! All right ! You 're bad ! Okay ! See , Phil ? That ... That was n't so hard . Kid , kid , kid . How many horns do you see ? - Six ? - Eh , close enough . Let 's get you cleaned up . Guys , guys , relax . It 's only halftime . That does n't sound good . Definitely not good ! Will you forget the head-slicing thing ? Phil , I do n't think we covered this one in basic training ! My favourite part of the game : sudden death . Oh . There goes another one . Just like Achilles . Game ... set , match . Hmm ? Phil , you got ta admit . That was pretty heroic . Hades mad . Well , what do you know ? From that day forward , our boy Hercules could do no wrong . He was so hot , steam looked cool . - Hercules - Hercules - Hercules - Ooh - Hercules - Look at my Hercules - Hercules , Hercules - Yeah , yeah , yeah Bless my soul Herc was on a roll - Undefeated - Riding high - And the nicest guy . - Not conceited - He was a nothing - A zero , zero - Now he 's a honcho - He 's our hero He hit the heights at breakneck speed From zero to hero Herc is a hero Now he 's a hero Yes , indeed Pull ! Nice shootin ' , Rex ... and it does n't even ... What are those ? Um , I do n't know . I-I thought they looked kinda dashing . I 've got 24 hours to get rid of this bozo ... or the entire scheme I 've been setting up for 18 years goes up in smoke ... and you are wearing his merchandise ? Thirsty ? Looks like your game 's over . Wonderboy is hitting every curve you throw at him . Oh , yeah . I wonder if maybe I have n't been throwing ... the right curves at him , Meg , my sweet . Do n't even go there . See , he 's got ta have a weakness ... because everybody 's got a weakness . I mean , for what ? Pandora , it was the box thing . For the Trojans , hey . They bet on the wrong horse , okay ? We simply need to find out Wonderboy 's . I 've done my part . Get your little imps ... Hey , I 've sworn off manhandling . Well , you know , that 's good because that 's what got you ... into this jam in the first place , is n't it ? You sold your soul to me to save your boyfriend 's life . And how does this creep thank you ? By running off with some babe . He hurt you real bad , did n't he , Meg ? Huh ? Look , I learned my lesson , okay ? Which is exactly why I got a feelin ' ... you 're gon na leap at my new offer . You give me the key to bringing down Wonder Breath ... and I give you the thing that you crave most ... in the entire cosmos : your freedom . You should have been there , Father . I mangled the Minotaur ... grappled with the Gorgon . Just like Phil told me . I analysed the situation ... controlled my strength and kicked . The crowds went wild ! - Thank you . Thank you . - Hah ! I 'm glad to hear you say that , Father . I 've been waiting for this day a long time . Hmm . What day is that , son ? The day I rejoin the gods . You 've done wonderfully . You really have , my boy . You 're just not there yet . You have n't proven yourself a true hero . But , Father , I 've beaten every single monster I 've come up against . I-I'm-I 'm the most famous person in all of Greece . I'm-I-I 'm an action figure ! I 'm afraid being famous is n't the same ... as being a true hero . What more can I do ? It 's something you have to discover for yourself . - But how can I ... - Look inside your heart . Father , wait ! On your left is Hercules ' villa . Our next stop is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop ... where you can pick up the great hero 's 30-minute workout scroll ... " Buns of Bronze " . I 'd advise you not to wear your new sandals . - Phil . - I told you , do n't move ! DGR , the Daughters of the Greek Revolution . - At 3:00 , you got ta get a girdle from some Amazons . - Phil . Phil , what 's the point ? That 's it ! Keep your toga on , pal . Yuck ! What do you mean , " What 's the point ? " You wan na go to Olympus , do n't ya ? Yeah , but this stuff does n't seem to be getting me anywhere . You ca n't give up now . I 'm countin ' on ya . I gave this everything I had . Listen to me , kid . I seen ' em all . And I am tellin ' you ... and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth ... you got somethin ' I never seen before . - Really ? - I can feel it ... right down in these stubby bowlegs of mine . - Hey , watch it ! - Watch it ! Watch ... - I touched his elbow ! - Hey , girls ! - I got his sweatband ! Phil , help ! - Okay . Escape plan : beta . - Gotcha . - Hey ! Where is he ? - There he goes ! On the veranda ! Whoa ! Let 's see . What could be behind curtain number one ? Meg ! It 's all right . The sea of raging hormones has ebbed . Gee , i-i-it 's great to see you . I-I-I missed you . So this is what heroes do on their days off . Nah . I 'm no hero . Sure ya are . everybody in Greece ... thinks you 're the greatest thing since they put the pocket in pita . I know , it 's ... it 's crazy . You know , I ca n't go anywhere without being mobbed . - I mean ... - You sound like you could use a break . Uh , Phil 's got the rest of the day pretty much booked . Ah , Phil , schmill . Just follow me out the window , round the dumbbells . You lift up the back wall and we 're gone . Wow . What a day . First that restaurant by the bay . And then that , that play , that , that , that Oedipus thing . Man ! I thought I had problems . - Psst ! Stop foolin ' around . - Yeah . Get the goods , sister . I did n't know that playing hookey could be so much fun . Yeah , neither did I . - Thanks , Meg . - Oh . Do n't thank me just yet . - Oh ! - Oop . Careful . sorry . Weak ankles . Oh , yeah ? Well , maybe you better sit down for a while . So , uh , do you have any problems ... with things like this ? - Uh ... - Weak ankles , I mean ... Ruptured disks ? No . I 'm , I 'm , I 'm afraid I 'm , uh , fit as a fiddle . - Wonderboy , you are perfect . - Thanks . Whoops ! It looks better that way . No , it really does . You know , when , when I was a kid ... I , I would have given anything to be exactly like everybody else . You wanted to be petty and dishonest ? - everybody 's not like that . - Yes , they are . - You 're not like that . - How do you know what I 'm like ? All I know is ... you 're the most amazing person with weak ankles I 've ever met . Oh ! Meg , when I 'm with you ... I-I do n't feel so alone . Sometimes it 's better to be alone . - What do you mean ? - Nobody can hurt you . Meg ? I would never ever hurt you ... stop this before we ... All right ! Break it up ! Break it up ! Party 's over ! - I 've been lookin ' all over this town ! - Calm down , mutton man . - It was all my fault . - You 're already on my list , sister ! So do n't make it worse ! And as for you , ya bum , you 're gon na go to the stadium ... and you 're gon na be put through the workout of your life ! - Now get on the horse . - Okay , okay . - I 'm sorry . - Ah , he 'll get over it . Move ! Move , move , move , move , move ! Move ! Hey , watch it . Watch it . Watch it . Keep your goo-goo eyes on the ... That 's it . Next time , I drive . Oh , what 's the matter with me ? You 'd think a girl would learn . I 'm through . - I 'm sorry . You mind runnin ' that by me again ? I must have had a chunk of brimstone wedged in my ear or something . Then read my lips ! Are n't we forgetting one teensy-weensy , but ever so crucial little , tiny detail ? I own you ! - Oh , oh , I got another horn here . - You work for me . That kid 's gon na be doin ' laps for a month . If I say , " Sing " , you say , " Hey , name that tune " . If I say , " I want Wonderboy 's head on a platter " , you say ... Medium or well done ? Oh ! I knew that dame was trouble . This is gon na break the kid 's heart . - I 'll work on that . - I 'm sorry . You hear that sound ? That 's the sound of your freedom fluttering out the window forever . I do n't care . I 'm not gon na help you hurt him . I ca n't believe you 're getting so worked up about some guy . This one is different . He 's honest and , and he 's sweet . - He 's a guy . - Besides , O Oneness , you ca n't beat him . He has no weaknesses . He 's gon na ... I think he does , Meg . I truly think he does . - Hey , Phil , what happened to you ? - Kid , we got ta talk . Oh , Phil , I just had the greatest day of my life . I , I , I ca n't stop thinkin ' about Meg . - She 's somethin ' else . - Kid ! I 'm tryin ' to talk to you ! Will you come down here and listen ? Aw , how can I come down there when I 'm feelin ' so up ? Gotcha ! Ah , very nice . What I 'm tryin ' to say is ... That if it was n't foryou , I never would have met her . Oh , I owe you big time , little guy . I do . - Listen to me . She 's ... - My dream come true ? - Not exactly . - More beautiful than Aphrodite ? - Aside from that ! - The most wonderful ... - She 's a ... She 's a fraud ! She 's been playin ' ya for a sap ! - Aw , come on . Stop kidding ' around . - I 'm not kiddin ' around . - She ... - I know you 're upset about today , but that 's no reason to ... - Kid , you 're missin ' the point . - The point is , I love her . - She do n't love you . - You 're crazy . - She nothing ' but a two-timin ' ... - Stop it ! - No-good , lying ' , schemin ' ... - Shut up ! Phil . I ... Oh , I 'm , I 'm sorry . Okay , okay , that 's it . I 'm goin ' home . Fine ! G ... Go ! I do n't ... I do n't need you . I thought you were gon na be the all-time champ ... not the all-time chump . Jeez Louise , what got his goat , huh ? Baboom . Name is Hades , lord of the dead . - Hi . How ya doin ' ? - Uh , not now , okay ? Hey , hey . I only need a few seconds , and I 'm a fast talker , all right ? See , I 've got this major deal in the works . A real estate venture , if you will . And , Herc , you little devil you . May I call you Herc ? You seem to be constantly getting in the way of it , huh ? - You 've got the wrong guy . - Hear me out , ya little ... Jeez , I mean , monsters , natural disasters . - You wait a day , huh ? - You 're out of your mind . Not so fast , because , ya see , I do have a little leverage you might wan na know about . - Meg ! - Do n't listen , Herc ... - Let her go ! - Here 's the trade-off . You give up your strength for about 24 hours , okay ? Say , the next 24 hours . And Meg here is free as a bird and safe from harm . We dance , we kiss , we schmooze , we carry on , we go home happy . What do ya say ? Come on . People are ... are gon na get hurt , are n't they ? Nah ! I mean , it 's , you know , it 's a possibility . - Is n't she ?

Baboom . Okay ? We 're done . What do you say we shake on it ? Hey , I really do n't have , like , time to bat this around . I 'm kind of on a schedule here . I got plans for August . Okay ? I need an answer , like , now . Going once , going twice ... - All right ! - Yes ! We 're there ! Bam ! You may feel just a little queasy . It 's kind of natural . Maybe you should sit down ! Now you know how it feels to be just like everybody else . Is n't it just peachy ? Oh ! You 'll love this . You 're off the hook . And by the way , Herc , is she not , like , a fabulous little actress ? - Stop it . - What do you mean ? I mean your little chickie-poo here was working for me all the time . - Duh . - You 're ... You 're lying ! - Help ! - Jeepers , mister , you 're really strong . - Could n't have done it without you , sugar , sweetheart , babe . - No ! It 's ... It 's not like that . I did n't mean to ...

Crystal ? At a picnic ? Well , what better occasion than for my nearest and dearest ? Oh . Well , how can you have a picnic without food ? Biddy 's making the food . As always . Oh . Mmm - - snails in phyllo dough . Mom , ca n't we ever have hamburgers and hot dogs like normal people ? Which ? Uh , sneakers . Beck says she wants to organize a family baseball game . Oh , there it is . Ow ! Oh !   Hey . Come on , I 'm starving . All right , all right .  Is there any food in there ? No . It 's for the champagne . Oh . Uh ... Well , I guess we 'll go for a jog then . Oh , go ahead - - just run away . Just like every other family gathering . Poppy , those are for Min Foo . Oh . Is she going to eat the whole jar ?  Well , when I was pregnant with Min Foo , I used to crave dills all the time . Mmm .  Oh , Poppy ! Love it ! Oh , I want more .  Hey , Min Foo , I came ... So , where is my mother ? Oh , there she is . Oh . Let me get your bag . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Hi ! Hi . Hi . Oh , see ? She does n't want to be here either . I do n't know why we have to celebrate Nono 's engagement to that ... that corporate lawyer . Because she 's your sister . Oh , come on . Hi , Barry . Oh . Hi , sweetheart . Hi . And you have got to be Peter . I 'm Rebecca . Hey , you want to come with me and meet your new cousins ? No . Oh , come on . Okay , a toast , everybody , a toast .

To Hakim and Min Foo . In August , they 're due . But most of all , to Nono and Barry . Oh . We are so delighted that they are going to marry .  Oh , and last but not least , a toast to Peter . I 'm not in your family . Oh . Better go get him before he jumps in the river . BARRY : Peter , get back here right now !  Peter , come on ! REBECCA : Did you ever have the feeling you turned into the wrong person ? ZEB : Mmm ... well , no . I mean look at me - - after 20 years , still a widow planning other people 's parties . Do n't read no more , discuss important issues , do n't got no friends . You 've got friends . You got the girls . You 've got me . Yeah , relatives . And everybody else I know is some kind of repairman . Relatives can be friends . Repairmen , I 'm not so sure about . Listen , I 'm serious , Zeb . Of course , I was married myself by then , and all three girls had chicken pox , but still . Okay , okay , to be continued . I 'm gon na make rounds at the hospital tomorrow . Okay . ' Night . ' Night .   REBECCA : I had the oddest dream last night . Were there any numbers in it ? What ? If you can recall any numbers , my friend Al is always after me for numbers to play the lottery with . He wants the numbers from my dreams , but I do n't have any dreams anymore . No , this was a , this was a dream about a boy . And he seemed to be ... my son . I was on a train , and I could n't quite see his face , but ... it seems that he was very handsome ... and confident . Do you recall what number train it was ? No . And I do n't know where we were going either . In fact , it 's sort of uninteresting . So , I 'd like to switch the subject to my birthday . Your birthday 's not till December , Poppy . December 11th . I 'm going to be100years old . Well , I know that , Poppy . I suppose you 're planning some big wingding for me . I mean , I mean bigger than usual , huh ? Well , we 'll see . Maybe .   : Yes . But it 's still pretty far away . And when we get a little closer ... Open Arms - - for all of life 's occasions . Oh , yes , hi , Melinda . Here 's a list . The guest list for my birthday party . REBECCA : Oh , certainly . Oh , he ... yeah , he 's a very good DJ . Yup , he brings his own sound system . Oh , I 'm sure he can play whatever anyone would like . Mom , it 's me ! If you dreamed you had a son and not daughters , and the boy was blonde and not dark , then you might have been dreaming how your life could be if you had chosen a different fork in the road -- if you 'd decided on some different kind of life . Or , it probably means my baby 's going to be a boy . No , Min Foo , this is not about you . And besides , he did n't have your coloring . He was blonde . I could have a blonde baby . Half my genes are yours , remember ? Well , yeah , maybe with Joey 's father . But I seriously doubt that you could hope to have blonde genes with Hakim . I know where this is going . Before we start talking about my choices in husbands , I have an obstetrician to see . Oh , honey , come on . I was n't implying anything about your various husbands . Yeah , right . I got to go . Bye , guys . This is a graduation party . Those are wedding bells . Aw . Hey , why do n't we pretend they 're school bells ? Yay ! Okay . Let 's just make sure they all work . Ooh , pretty . Nice . Yeah . You know that these were strung across the room the first time I ever came here . Hey , little woman , please make up your mind . You 've got to come into my world . And leave your world behind . Come on , now . Na-na-na-na-na-na ... ?  MAN : I see you 're having a wonderful time . Hi . I 'm Joe Davich . That guy you 're laughing at , that 's , uh , my kid brother , Zeb . I 'm Rebecca Holmes . I 'm Amy 's roommate . Are you a friend of Artie 's ? Oh , no , no , my family owns this place . Oh . Can I get you some champagne ? Oh . Oh ! I am so sorry . Come in the kitchen with me . Joe , get the ham . Wish I would have known you were coming . Joe so seldom brings his dates home . I 'm not his ... Of course , you know Joe 's children . Children ? This is Nono and Patch and Biddy . And you 've probably heard the story . Their mother Tina escapes to New York City and dumps the whole crew on me . Mommy 's going to be a famous nightclub singer . So some would have us believe . Here , Mother . A little soap and water , and no one will ever know . Right . Let 's clean off those shoes , huh ? Okay . Mommy has this beautiful dress where the straps are made of diamonds . Really ? There . Good as new . Thanks . Come on . MOTHER : Where are you taking her ? Do n't worry , we 'll see her again . Okay , guys . Uh ... we will be seeing you , wo n't we ? I 'm gon na have love at first sight , too . Oh , I hope you do , dear . We finished just a few hours ago . Well ... Is n't that lovely ? Oh , yeah . Here 's the problem . Katie did n't graduate . She did n't graduate ? No . I was laying out her clothes this morning and suddenly Katie turned to me and she said , " Oh , did I mention I flunked chemistry ? " At the time , I failed to understand that flunking chemistry would keep her from graduating , but it-it did and ... Well , listen . Is n't it fortunate that you already planned this party ? It sends such a message . A message ? Yeah , a message - - that you love and you support your daughter in spite of her failure . Oh . But my friends . Yeah , really . Happy .  Well , I suppose it is kind of difficult to cancel at this late date . But I-I-I thought maybe ... You know , Katie 's such a lucky girl . ZEB : Nice save , Beck . How do you manage to pull these things off ? Well , it 's not like I ever had a choice . What is that supposed to mean ? Oh , never mind . You know , maybe I should get myself a dog . I mean , if I had a dog to walk , it would be easier to meet people , right ? Maybe you should just get away from the Open Arms for a while . Go somewhere , visit someone . Yeah , well that 's my point . But you just got here . Yeah , but I have a big anniversary party at the Open Arms . Oh , that place . Oh , darling , no . That place is how I make my money . What little there is of it . That 's the Daviches ' business . No , actually it 's mine . And there 's Poppy to think about . Oh , that old man . Is he still alive ? Yes , he 's still alive . Exactly how are you related ? He 's Joe 's father 's twin brother . You know that , Mother . Darling . You could have done so much better . Like how ? Oh , you were such a brilliant student , Rebecca . Do you remember that paper on Robert E . Lee ? Did n't the professor say that you could expand it into an honors project ? Well , he suggested that I ... And before you got started , bang , here comes Joe Davich and puts you to work . Mother ... One day you were as good as engaged , and the next you up and married a man that nobody knew from Adam . I made a choice . Well , it was the wrong choice . You and Will Allenby were soul mates . You 've been a different woman ever since you jilted Will .  POPPY : Rebecca ! Where were you ?  You knew where I was , Poppy . I was at my mother 's . Oh , is she still alive ? Is that Biddy ? It 's not like I was n't gon na tell you . Why does n't anybody answer this ? Hello ? Uh , uh , Open Arms , for all of life 's occasions . You 've always hated my cooking . Yeah ? That 's not true . Tomorrow night at 8:00 . Besides , we just want you That 's right to be able to enjoy the wedding . All right , well , we 'll be very happy to see you then . Oh , please . Barry and I just want a more straightforward menu . And besides , Biddy 's never done a garden wedding before . Who 's having a garden wedding ? We are . Here . Mother suggested it . I think it 's a great idea . Oh , Tina suggested it . Oh , is Tina doing the landscaping ? Of course not - - Mother does n't arrive until two days before the wedding . Aha . I see . We can do it , Beck . I am a florist , after all .    Mother 's here !  Oh , Rachel . Dear ! Rebecca . Mother brought us gifts from London . Oh . Nice . Oh , Mother , please . Oh , Mother , I love them . For your chignon . Oh . Oh , thank you so much . It 's about 1812 . All that tea with this instant family . Mother , I love it . Min Foo , she 's not your mother . Oh , I-I just ... Oh , Minerva , I 've always thought of you as my fourth daughter , have n't I ? Rebecca , come , come , come . You have n't opened your present yet . Oh . Okay . Oh . An apron . I thought something useful . Thank you . Now , Barry , tell me all about the wedding plans . Well , we finally found a minister . Nono and I were at a restaurant the other night Mm-hmm . wondering who we could get to marry us , and our waitress said , " Well , I can do that . " So , what 'll it be ? Do you , like , take this woman here to be your lawfully wedded wife ? Oh , you 're joking . Turns out she has some kind of certificate she sent away for through the mail . You did n't tell me this . It 's ... Oh , well . Why not ? It 's all a big charade , anyhow , I mean , my singing teacher was devastated when I married Joe , I mean , " My dear , you are throwing away a God-given talent . " I mean , marriage may be useful during those little child-bearing years , but , all that , " My darling , are n't you amazing ? " gives away to blood pressure monitoring and hand holding when the man retires and he ca n't think what to do with themselves . And the wives , meanwhile , start longing to get free from this institution invented by males for their own benefit . It 's all a primitive tribal ritual , meant to make us forget we 're merely propagating the species .  She certainly knows the right thing to say to a bride and groom .  Oh , hello . Is this Alumni Records ? This is Rebecca Holmes Davich . Okay . Oh , good . All right . Thanks very much . Okay , bye-bye .  I ca n't believe Uncle Poppy 's still here . He was always such a bore . I mean , all the Daviches , a bunch of mopers . How ironic their profession was throwing parties . I mean , just because your house has 14 foot ceilings does n't automatically turn you into a social butterfly . I do n't know how you 've managed all these years . I just put one foot in front of the other . You do n't have any , shall we say , man friends , I suppose . No . Well , of course not . After baby-sitting Joe Davich , why would you want one ? Yes , why would I ? Oh . Ah . This place is like a time machine . Same old sink . Same sticky wooden cabinets . Same scummy little drinking glasses . Same rusty screen door . Why , how American . Instant lawn ! Been working out every day . Oh .   She 's so cute .  Oh ... Oh ... Today we are gathered here to witness a celebration of the human family . The uniting of two people in marriage . Nono and Barry come before us here today to ... be united in marriage . Theirs is a love that springs from the affection of those who loved them into being . And to that source , let us all turn and ask , who gives this woman ? Oh . Me .  London , well ... Our mother 's actually flirting with her new son-in-law . Nono 's about to kill her . She was telling Barry they ought to take Peter on their honeymoon . Every time , you girls ca n't wait for your mother to get here . Now you ca n't wait for her to leave . Oh , I told Nono that Peter could stay here . I mean , she 's lucky there 's a cake at all . Oh , honey , it 's a lovely cake . It just needs a little ... Peter , I have a job for you . No . I ca n't . Oh , yes , of course you can . You just-just be creative . And we 're smiling , and we 're smiling . Yes , and we 're smiling . Um ... Sir , um , you're-you 're in the shot . Can you ... ? Yeah , okay . Oh . Thank you . You did a great job with those strawberries . PHOTOGRAPHER : We 're smiling and we 're smiling . Nice .  Okay , everyone . Everyone , group photo , group photo . Yes , group photo . Okay . That 's right . That 'd be us . We 'll just ... Oh , Beck , Peter , come on . Come on , Beck . Oh , all right . PHOTOGRAPHER : We 're smiling , and ... Quickly . PHOTOGRAPHER : Okay . Smiles , and we 're smiling , and we 're smiling .   Dr . Allenby . Will . Laura ? Who ? Will , this is , uh , Rebecca Holmes Davich . Rebecca ? Oh , gosh , I ... I hope you were n't asleep . No , no , no , no , no , no . I know it 's ... I know it 's late , uh ... Oh , my , I did n't realize how late . You know , um , in fact , I think that I 'll just call back another time . B-B-Bye-bye . Ay-yi-yi . Oh , no .  Open Arms , for all of life 's occasions . Yes , yes , that 's right . He 's staying here with us while Nono and Barry are on their honeymoon . Oh ... Remember ? Mm . Do you remember Nono 's wedding cake ? Yeah , I remember . You know how it kind of ... it kind of ... it-it kind of tilted ? Mm , yeah . Well , I do n't feel that cakes are Biddy 's strong point , so I 'd like you to find somebody else to make my birthday cake . I 'll be 100 years old .  : December 11 . Mm ... Taking that to your room , huh ? Yeah , I think I will . Hey , how about you and I go out for some ice cream , huh ? Get some fresh air ? No thanks . How ' bout a game ? Uh , Clue , Checkers , Monopoly , Scrabble , huh ? We ca n't tell your dad you did n't do one thing the whole time you were here . I do n't care . He 'll forget it before the balloons have shriveled maybe the instant it 's over . He could enjoy the party while it 's happening , though , even if he did forget it later . Yeah . Well , you 're right about that . Hmm . Guess this is about all I can do . Whoa . Ho , ho , ho . 60 points . Hey , I suspect you might be a hustler .  Open Arms , for all of life 's occasions . Rebecca speaking . This is Will Allenby . Will . H-How 'd you get my number ? I looked at my caller ID . Anyway , Rebecca what did you call me for ? Oh , gosh , I , you know , I just h-happened to be home -- I mean , at ... at Mom 's , and-and she and I just got talking about old times , and I thought to myself , " Gee , wonder whatever happened to ... Will Allenby ? Wonder where he got to ... at MacAdam , that is . Well , no , I have n't been here the whole time . I ... I did go away for my doctorate . Um , I teach here now . Oh , that 's wonderful , Will . I 'm the head of the Physics Department . Well , that 's really wonderful . Well , you know , it 's been such a long time . Maybe-maybe you and I should just get together , you know , catch up , or ... I ... I happen to be free this evening . Oh , this evening ? Oh , no , I-I could n't do that , ' cause I 've got a tea dance , and then ... Oh , boy . This weekend , I got a funeral , and I got , uh , an engagement party , but , um ... Well , what about Monday , uh , um , at that place ? Is it still there ? The , um ..... Well , why do n't we just say 7:00 , the Maple Tree ? All right . Okay , good . See you then . That was my very first boyfriend . Well , my only boyfriend , besides Joe Davich .   Oh , good . That 's right . Well , thanks for watching him , honey . That 's okay . He did n't play with the kids at all . He just sat reading a book the whole time . There 's nothing wrong with that . Why the sudden urge to go shopping ? Oh , nothing , I 'm just sick of the same old clothes . Time for some new one's . Well , I 'd better get back .  Bye , Peter . Bye . I decided not to tell Min Foo about my date . It 's none of her business . Besides , it 's not really a date . I used to love to read when I was young . I 'd be crazy not to . Would you go into the past or the future ? The future . Absolutely the future , ' cause I want to know what 's going to happen . Yeah , me too .  MAN : Hello ? Rebecca ! Oh , J.J . Rebecca ! Oh , J.J . , I 'm so happy you 're here . Boy , that ceiling really needs to be patched . Well , we 'll do that . REBECCA : Yeah . Mm . Oh . Yeah , well , I-I 'm having dinner with my old high school sweetheart on Monday , and I'm-I 'm just as nervous as a cat on a ...  : You know , Tanya was my , uh , high school sweetheart . Really ? My gosh . You two really made a go of it , huh ? Yeah . Well , not that you have n't had to ... work at it . Yeah . No good , huh ? Well ... the color 's nice . Mm . W-w-w-what about those , uh , harem pants you had on the-the time I was patching the bathroom ? Oh , no , no , no . I-I do n't want to wear pants to a restaurant , and , besides , they did n't make ...  : Were n't good for my derriere .  But ... the color 's nice . Oh , Poppy , your tapioca 's in the fridge . Uh-huh . And do n't forget your penguin program 's on at 9:00 . Okay . I wo n't forget . Night-night . Yeah . Have fun . Okay . Uh-huh . Mm . Yum . Good evening . Oh . Hi . I 'm meeting someone here . I do n't suppose ... Would that be him ? Uh , no . Oh ... I ... William . Hello , Will . Hi . Oh . It was too much trouble . May I tell Marvin what you 're having to drink ? Who 's Marvin ? Iced tea , please . Oh . I 'll just have , um ... w-water , thank you . Sparkling or still ? Pardon ? Tap , I think . Right ? Yes , tap . It is so good to see you , Will . Me too . I mean , it 's good for me to see you , too . Except for the braid , you ... you look just the same . Oh , no , no , I have n't changed a bit . Ha , ha . So , decided what you 're having ? Well , not quite . Oh , I-I-I 'm sorry . I 'll see what I should be having here . Oh , you should go first , Rebecca . Oh . All right . Yes . Oops . Oh , dear . Well , salmon 's ... Uh , you have salmon , I 'm sure , do n't you ? I always liked that ... Uh , maybe the rib roast ? And how would you like that cooked ? Well done . Thank you very much . Yeah . Well done it is . Or , uh , you know ... how ' bout the award , uh , winning , uh , swordfish ? Swordfish . U-unless ... would it actually be the award-winning swordfish if it did n't have the sauce ?  So , the swordfish , no sauce , and salad , no dressing , thank you .  Sorry , uh , I do n't eat out often . I-I cook for myself . Oh . I make my famous chili . You remember my chili . Oh , your chili . Yes , right , of course . The way I prepare it is , every Sunday , I mix up two batches and then divide them up into seven containers . And that 's what I 'd eat each night for the week . For the whole week ? Mm-hmm . I do n't know how I 'll deal with that yet . My , my . Well , it sure sounds like you 've adjusted to-to living by yourself . I mean ... since your divorce . I ca n't complain . I mean , I-I rent a very nice apartment . Mm-hmm . It 's even got a little s-study that could be made into a guest room , and if my ... if my daughter ever wanted to spend the night over . Oh , well , you have a daughter ? Yes , a 17-year-old high school senior . Oh . Beatrice . Of course that ... That 's nothing compared to you . Uh-uh . No , that 's right .  : I ... I 'm way ahead of you . I 've got five grandchildren . Hmm . But that 's because my husband 's three girls are older , from a previous marriage . H-How did he pass away , if-if you do n't mind my asking ? No . Well , of course , a car wreck is a-always sudden . It was just ... I was just so unprepared , you know . Mm . 26 years old . And his girls had just adjusted to the fact that I even existed .  Oh . Well , I 'm not sure I 'd know how to deal with that . I managed all right . We ... We were fine . Thank you . It seems so long ago , does n't it ? You broke my heart , Rebecca . I mean , no warning . I mean , I thought everything was fine , and then , you just said good-bye without a reason why . I had to hear that you got married two weeks later , from my mother . Yeah . I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm sorry . You know , I-I ... I know I did n't handle that very well , but , uh ... Everything to your liking , folks ? Yes , uh , everything 's fine , thank you . And I just seemed to be getting farther and farther away from my original self . And then , this summer , I just sort of ... I do n't know . I just sort of woke up , and I thought , " Who have you turned into ? "  And that 's why I called you . I ... Oh , yeah . Figured you could just waltz right on back as if you 'd never even left ? No , I never thought that . Thought I 'd say , " Oh , " sure , Rebecca . " I forgive you for everything . " Let 's go back to , uh , the good old days . " No , no , no . I never thought that at all . I trusted you . I 'm really sorry ... I can see this has been a mistake . MAN  : Preening can be a part of the breeding behavior .   As soon as penguins are out of the water , they start cleaning and combing their feathers . Unlike his Antarctic neighbors , the penguin mates for life . The pains are five minutes apart . Oh . Oh , honey . Just remind yourself that you 're gon na get a baby out of this . Bye , Mommy . I bet that you are gon na have a brand new brother or sister before lunchtime . Min Foo is having a baby ? I thought she was divorced . Poppy , she divorced Professor Drake . And then she divorced LaVon . And then she married Hakim . Hakim ?  : Oh , good God . An-An Arab ?  Poppy . Open Arms . F-for ... O-Oh . Hi . Yes , yes , J.J . Yeah , well , I 'm afraid that faucet still is leaky , but listen , J.J . , Min Foo 's having her baby today . Yeah . So , I got to ... Well , then you can understand why I got to keep the line free . All right . Bye , bye , thanks . Ooh . You said we 'd have a new brother or sister before lunchtime . Is Mommy okay ? Oh , yes . Of course she is . And , you know , sometimes ... Just move your little drawings , kids , for me . Sometimes it just takes a little bit longer . Oh , you did a lovely job on those candles . Let 's light ' em up . Razzle dazzle time . Whoo !  If I could undo one modern invention , it would be the telephone . I would choose the zipper .   Open ... WILL : Rebecca ? It 's Will . Oh , Will . Uh , I really ... I ... I 'm ... I do n't know why you rushed off like that . The-The waiter was wondering if anything was wrong . And I ... Listen , my daughter 's about to have a baby , and I really ca n't talk . Uh , thanks . Okay . I ...  Oh , boy .   Open Ar ... Hakim ? Yes ? Whoo ! Yes , I think Abdul 's a wonderful name for a boy . Yay ! Yay ! Oh . Come over here .  Oh , handsome boy . Look at you . Look at you . You 're so beautiful . Welcome to the world , Abdul . Say hi to Grandma .     Rebecca , it 's Will Allenby again . I trust everything 's fine with your daughter 's baby . I , uh ... I just wanted to apologize for the other evening . Lately , it 's been all I can do to just get up in the morning . I look in the mirror and think , " Gosh , same old me . Perfect . If a man is divorced , he 's always angry at his ex-wife . But if he 's widowed , he always feels guilty about remarrying . Mother , who said anything about remarrying ? We 're just having a meal together . That should put us back here about 9:30 or 10:00 . Is that enough time ? Oh , yeah , that's-that 's plenty of time . Thanks , Zeb . Oh , Beck , so , is this a ... Is this an actual date you 're having ? No . I 'm much too old to be dating .  Okay , Poppy . Oh . Mm . Do n't you two get into any trouble . Okay . Too old to be dating ...   Oh . Whoa . Oh , you should n't have . I know I 'm early . I allowed a little extra time , in case I got lost . Come on in . Oh . My goodness . Whoo . Here you go . Ah .  My , is n't that ... Is n't that unusual . Yeah . And what 's it called ? I do n't know . They said it was impossible to kill , is all .  : Oh , good . Well , I guess I should have dressed up a little more , huh ? Oh , no . I 'm not so dressed up . Oh , this is , uh , very ... Well , this is quite a place you have . Well , do n't let it fool ya . I expect the ceiling to fall down any ... any minute now . Well , I mean , it 's ... it 's really impressive . It must have quite a ...  Yeah ? Uh , quite a history to it . Mm-hmm . Um , I ... I believe your doorbell rang . Oh , yes , right . Well , just make yourself at home . Hi , J.J . Hi ... azal ... Okay . Fine . Wha-What is that ?  : You know , I 'm not sure exactly . I-I-I 've never seen anything like it . Thanks , J.J . Hey , you-you want to take a peek at them before we start planting ? No , it 's fine , it 's fine . How about I fetch you one of those , uh , hang tags with a color photo ? You know , I really do n't care , J.J . I 've got company . Oh . High school sweetheart .  Was this your husband ?  N-No , no . We got that at a garage sale . Oh . Come on , I 'll show you what my husband looked like . Oh , uh ... Oh , here .  I'll-I 'll just let the ... the machine get that . Now , he 's here somewhere , but ...  And this is my eldest stepdaughter , Biddy , standing next to Min Foo 's ex , LaVon . And that 's Nono . Oh , does n't she make a beautiful bride ? And let 's see . This is Patch . She 's celebrating the girls lacrosse team winning State . And , uh ... Oh . There 's Joe . Yes . Well , you always did want to have a lot of children . I did ? Mm-hmm . Gosh , I do n't remember that . Would you bring the biscuits in , please ? Sure .  What 's going on in your backyard ? Oh , they 're putting in some azaleas . Oh .  This is like running a plantation . The , uh , divorce was Laura 's idea . One day , she just announced that she wanted me to move out . Of course , she kept our daughter . Laura 's always had a better understanding of Beatrice . Not like you . Excuse me ? I , I mean you were always so mature for your age , so involved with your studies , so ... serious . I always regret that I did n't finish my education . Mmm . Do you remember this new theory that I had of , of why Robert E . Lee decided to cast his lot with the South ? Lee ? Mmm . Maybe I should finish that research . Th-there are other things you can do , too , uh ... Museums could be particularly edifying . Gosh , I ca n't remember the last time I was in a museum . Perhaps we could go together . I 'm going down to Washington on Friday . Maybe you could join me . Wonderful museums there . Oh , I 'd love to do that , Will .  Friday , then . Good . Your phone sure does ring a lot . Can we go in the other room ? Rebecca ... It 's occurred to me that this was very providential . I mean , it 's so incredibly providential that you called me when you did , Rebecca . In the old days , ice cream places offered unlimited samples . Egg nog , pistachio , rum raisin - - any flavor . Well , hi . What are you doing here ? We stopped for ice cream , but Poppy was so displeased with the service , he said he 'd just as soon have his dessert at home . Hi , I 'm , I 'm Will Allenby . Hi , I 'm Zeb , Rebecca 's brother-in-law . This is my uncle , Paul Davich . Sorry to barge in like this . I thought you were going to the movies . After that smart aleck in the , in the ice cream parlor , I , I did n't have the heart for it . Wh-What 's for dessert ? Well , I remembered that Will did n't care for sweets , so I did n't make a dessert . POPPY : Oh . " Our Rebecca " ? Well , actually , um ... kindergarten . Beck ! Are you home ?  He-here . Where have you been ? I 've been phoning and phoning you all evening . Uh , Will , this is my stepdaughter , Nono , and this is her stepson , Peter . This is Will Allenby , my old high school sweetheart . Really ? Nice to meet you . Go ahead , Peter , tell Rebecca what you wanted to ask her . What , honey ? Um ... at my school , they have this exhibit of these projects . And they have us invite our grandparents . It 's on Friday . Is it this Friday ? Uh-huh . And , I know you 're not really my grandma , but since my dad 's parents are dead , I was wondering if ... I 'd be honored to . Ice cream - - who wants ice cream ? Super Chunky Chango ice cream . No , of course not . The museums will always be there . Yeah . Well , you still have quite a drive , right ? Yes . I 'll call you . I 'll call you tomorrow .   Yikes . Thanks for supper . REBECCA : Toast ! To Abdul Abdulazim . His arrival makes us beam . It 's such a pleasure to have a new boy . Let 's hope he 's as nice as Lateesha and Joey .  Joey got stung by a bee ! Oh , my Lord . He 's allergic ! Well , how did a bee get in here ? It 'll be okay . Let 's just go to the hospital . I 'll get some ice . I 've got Abdul . Dixon , you and Emmy take Lateesha to the backyard . Wait , I 'm coming . I 've got the ice . Beck ? Oh , Poppy , please , not now . Beck , I ... I do n't feel so good . Is this a heart attack ? I did n't have my , my 100th birthday party yet . You 'll have your party , Poppy , I promise you . I 'll call you . PARAMEDIC : Watch your step .  It 's okay . It 's going to be okay . How are we doing ? Well , he 's not feeling so ... Zeb ... they 're trying to finish me off . Nope , they 're letting you go . Turns out it was indigestion .  : Oh . Indigestion ? I spoke with the resident . He said you had three cupcakes at the baby welcoming . Well , what if I did ? I 've eaten far more many a time . We should let them know at home . Poppy ... They must be pretty worried . Yeah . Did Joey get his shot ? He 's already back at the party , making up for lost time . I 'll go call . Yeah , well , I do n't know what the world is coming to if a man ca n't eat three measly cupcakes without folks calling an ambulance .  REBECCA : Oh , I forgot the dessert . You do like dessert , now , do n't you , monsieur ? Whoa .  Thank you . How 's your father-in-law ? My father-in-law ? Mm-hmm . Oh , you mean Poppy . Uh , he 's not my father-in-law . He 's Joe 's uncle . Want this one ? And you still live with him , even though you 're barely related . Well , I sort of inherited him . He came with the house .  For a while I resented having to take care of him , but when I thought he might die , I ... I realized how much he means to me . Do n't mind my asking , but ... how come after your husband died you never remarried ? I do n't know . " The most wildly other person . Not ... well , that 's why I was drawn to Joe , I guess . But now I just , uh , think the idea of being with somebody different would just ... be exhausting . Well , look at you and me . We 're totally different , Rebecca . We are ? Oh , well it might seem so now , but ... well , I think of the old days , the things that interested us ... well , I think , yeah , that was back ... that was back when we were grownups . ' Course , you still are a grownup , but me , I ... I feel like I 've been traveling in reverse .  WILL : Robert E . Lee . Boy , things sure have changed since we were at MacAdam , huh ? WILL : Go . REBECCA : Oh , wow ! This was such a good idea , Will . Uh-huh . This one might be good . On special order . Oh , dear . No , no , it 's all right . Hmm ? Wo n't take long ? Uh-uh . No problem . Okay . Come on .  We 'll call you when it comes in . Great , thanks ; you 're done . Let me grab these . I 'll take some of those . No , no , no ; here we go . Oh , well . Chivalry is not dead .  Thank you .  Hello . ZEB : Hey , Beck . Oh , hi , Zeb . What you doing ? Ooh , I 'm reading a fascinating book . Me , too . The Harmful Effects of Nightlights on Children . Nightlights ? Children who 've been raised with nightlights end up with vision problems . Their eyes do n't get enough rest . They should read this book - - that 'd put them to sleep . You 're fine the way you are . I am not . I 'm a slug . You of all people - - a doctor . No , from now on , I am concentrating on me . You 're right . Good night . Good night .  Hi , nice to meet you . How 's that ? Good . Oh , that 's great .  Oh , where 's your project ? It 's over here . REBECCA : This is yours ? PETER : Uh-huh . Oh , my gosh .   This is wonderful ! I do n't know how you did this . What do ... what do your teachers say ? I think they kind of liked it . Oh , I bet they do . Is there a motor ?  : That 's a secret . Oh . Oh , then do n't tell me . Do n't tell me . No , I ... I just want to stay here and admire this one . Oh , no , no . That boy is brilliant . Yes . Everybody keeps telling me how bright he is . I just ... I wish he could drive . Honey , did you see his project ? I do n't know if it was music or art or science , but it is astounding . I was the one who had to ferry him to the back of beyond for supplies . Barry was away attending a conference , would n't you know ? I know it 's hard . But I so wish that you could enjoy this boy , because he is going to be grown and gone in a flash . Easy for you to say . You do n't have the slightest idea what it 's like being saddled with somebody else 's kid when you 're still practically on your honeymoon . GIRL : No , no , no , no ! Oh , Will , I would love to meet your daughter . Oh , mm . Something I can bring ? No , just yourself . What shall I wear ? Anything ... or-or maybe ... no ... just anything . No , Will , you can tell me . I mean , is there something special you want me to wear or not wear ? Well , I ... I-I-I do n't know , um ...  Maybe ... something not too ... hippie . Hippie ? Well , it's-it 's just that some of your clothes tend to be a bit ... exotic . Oh . And-and I want Beatrice to focus on you more as a person . Oh , oh , oh , I see . Okay .  Ta-da . Oh . Well , you look great . Thank you . Hi . Come on in , come in . My , this is wonderful . Come in here . Here , ha-have a seat . All right . Oh . Uh , Beatrice is n't here yet , huh ? No , but I expect her . Aw ... What ? Everything 's going to be just fine . You do n't know Beatrice . We are going to have such fun . I 'm serving this nutritious , all-grain dish . She 's a vegetarian .  Oh , boy . Excuse me . I used chicken stock , but do n't say a word . Oh . My lips are sealed . Hi , Beatrice . Hello , Beatrice . So , you told me to come here at 6:00 . Here I am . Well , thank you , Bea . I 'm very glad you came . Are we eating supper or not ? Oh , oh , do n't you want to sit around a while and talk ? I ... Talk ? About what ? And who is this lady , anyhow ? Oh . I 'm , um ... I 'm , um , a very old , old friend of your father 's . Beatrice ... Oh ! Oh , my goodness . Well , I guess we 've fallen in fond , but really , I came here to meet you tonight . Your father 's told me so much about you . Yeah ? Well , I 'm not here ' cause I want to be . I 'm here because he promised me my own cell phone if I came . Oh . Okay , we 've met . Can I go now ? You-you-you have n't eaten . All right , if you insist , let 's eat . Oh .  This is a complete , in one dish , whole grain meal . Oh . Entirely vegetarian . Actually , I eat meat now . You do ? Well , we can all stand to eat some grain from time to time . Beatrice , pass me your plate . I 'm afraid I 'm not much of a chef ... do many men have you to supper , Rebecca ? Oh . Well , I do n't ... No . ' Cause , actually , you seem pretty normal on the surface . I 'm just wondering if you realize what kind of guy you 're eating with , here . Uh , he 's a pretty nice guy . The guy who kidnapped our dog when Mom asked him for a divorce . Your dog ? Our little dog , Flopsie . I did not kidnap Flopsie Doodle . I borrowed her . He stole her while we were out , and we came home , and we called , " Flopsie . " No Flopsie . So my mom phoned my dad . We knew it was him . And she said that she was calling the police . Do you know what he did ? He lied , and he said , oh , he had no idea what she was talking about . I was feeling sad , okay ? I was having a difficult time . Like it was n't difficult for Mom and me ? I went looking for her in the rainstorm . I was out half the night , and when I found her , all covered with mud , I-I put her in my brand-new car , and I brought her home . How many times can I apologize ? Well , just so you know , you 're boyfriend 's a total perv . You 're getting me a cell phone tomorrow .   Well , I guess this was n't very successful . Oh , well , it 's ... You know what ? Now that I 've met your family , I want you to meet mine . I mean , I already ... Well , three or four you bumped into , but I ... but I mean a proper dinner party with everybody there . Okay ? That 'd be great . Good . Oh ... Gracious . If I 'd known that Beatrice was back eating meat , I would have served my chili . Hmm . Mm-hmm . All right . Bye-bye . Bye . Hmm .  ZEB : He kidnapped their dog ? REBECCA : Oh , yeah . Oh , boy . Well , in a way , I think he 's still , um , in mourning for his marriage . You know , he 's been going through a really difficult time . He 's kind of an odd guy , and I just thought a party where he could meet all of you would ... Rebecca , I 've met Will on a couple of occasions . Yeah , I know , but I-I 'd like him to meet everybody , all together , you know - - a more formal atmosphere . Formal ? Yeah , just not some typical Davich free-for-all potluck where Will could be overwhelmed , but something ... sedate and organized . I want you to meet the man in my life . You have a man in your life ? You never told me that . Oh , you know Will has been coming around now and then . I thought he was just a friend .  Why are you springing this on me now ? I am not springing anything on you . This is not about you . Saturday night ? You 're never free on Saturdays . Is the Open Arms going under ? No more than usual . Well , have n't I already met this person ? Yes , but-but I want this to be a more official introduction to the family as a whole . Okay , look , whatever . I 'm running late , okay ? Okay . Bye .   Open Arms . How come you invited Min Foo to dinner and not me ? Patch , I was just going to ... Is this because she 's your real daughter ? I hate you . Oh , Beck , this is so exciting . A man in your life . I am making something fabulous . What is that you 're wearing ? Oh , just something different than my usual hippie dippie color crazy thing , you know ? Call it flight attendant casual .   Well , fasten your seat belts , me merry crew . Hi , Will . Am I late or early or ... okay ? Oh , you 're ... you 're right on time . Come on . Okay . Yeah . WILL : Thanks . I trust you have nothing against hearts of palm . That what that is ? I thought it 'd be a nice ... symbolic touch . Hearts , romance , you know ? Hmm . Palm trees are cut up for that ?  Broccoli plants are cut up . Asparagus shoots are cut up . Do n't tell me you 're one of those food avoiders . Hearts of palm is just a salad . So , you and Rebecca have-have known each other since you were kids ? 50 years . Oh ! Can I really have been alive that long ? And now you 're reunited . That 's , uh ... Must be complicated , though , living in separate towns . WILL : Oh , that 's exactly it . My odometer 's taken a huge leap , and my engine 's developed a cough , uh ... Oh , well , you-you should give J.J . a call . WILL : J.J . ? Yeah , J.J . does a lot of , uh , odd jobs around here , but , oh , he is a gifted mechanic . He 's the only one that can coax my Chevy along . J.J . 's great . Yeah . Oh , you know , he is forever bragging about his wife , Tanya . Well , lately , though , Tanya 's had to increase her medication . Poor thing , you know , she 's just given to these sort of demented delusions , and , uh , oh , gosh , one day , she was walking across somebody 's front porch ; she was wildly flinging a-a souvenir Japanese sword . Ay-yi-yi . And , uh ... J.J . said that that 's not the real true Tanya . He just still thinks that his wife is ... amazing . That 's the man that repairs your cars .  Oh . Hello . We 're in here . MIN FOO : I told you , she 's not gon na be ... Hi . I know you said adults only ... Hi . but I 'm still breast-feeding . What do you expect ? It 's all right . It 's all right . Hi . Hey . Do n't put him there . Someone 's gon na step on him . This man is hopeless . You could have seen for yourself that it was n't made . Shh . It 's all right , it 's all right . What is that you 're wearing ? PATCH : It 's us . Hi . Sorry we 're late . What is that you 're wearing ? It is my brand-new suit that I bought on Thursday , and I like it , so do n't say a word . Ah , everyone , I would like you to meet Will Allenby , the person I invited you here to meet .     Min Foo , do that in the other room . MIN FOO : I 'm decently covered . I 'm not sitting here naked . We have company . What must he think ? I 'm sure you 've seen a woman nursing a baby before . Well , yes . I mean , of course .  Though , not at a dinner table , but ... I will not . MIN FOO : Hakim ! I shall go . A toast . Oh , yes , a toast . Yeah . POPPY : A toast . Good . POPPY : I propose a toast to ... a toast to me and my birthday .  Oh , Poppy . It is not your birthday . POPPY : Oh .  : This is a toast to Will , welcome . Oh , yeah , a toast to Will . To-To welcome Will . ALL : To Will . POPPY : Here 's to Will . Here , here .  WILL : Thank you . Ah . Um ... maybe a toast to ... Rebecca . Oh . To Rebecca for being so lovely , so gracious , and cheering up my life . Thank you . To Becky ! Rebecca . ZEB : Ca n't imagine where we 'd all be if Rebecca had n't shown up . She turned out to be awfully good for business .  : Oh , God . I let fly a champagne cork ...  ... straight into a woman 's bosom .  ZEB : Right . Rebecca crumples to the floor in mortification , like she 's the one who got hit , and this women just keeps right on talking , completely unaware . Falsies was my considered opinion .  Then she bends down and she says , " Are you all right , dear ? " And then I just popped right up , and I ...  : I poured the champagne ...  ... like nothing happened .  Hmm .    HAKIM : ? Oh Abdul , boy . The pipes , the pipes are calling ? Here . ? From glen to glen ? Oh . ? And down the mountainside ... ? Sweet . I did n't know he was Irish . ? WOMAN : I 'll call you tomorrow . Nice to see you again , Will . REBECCA : I loved that . Thank you , bye , bye . We 'll see you again . Thanks , Beck . Thank you , Rebecca . Bye , bye . All right . It was nice to meet you , Will . Bye , Will . Thanks . Bye . Yeah . Frankly , I 'm having a hard time sorting them all out .  I mean , why-why is that one , uh , stepdaughter , uh , Chinese ? And ... and the fella , uh , Troy - - is he Biddy 's husband ? No , no . Fir-First of all , Min Foo is my daughter , not my stepdaughter . I named her Minerva . But Joe took one look at her paintbrush hair and her sleepy eyes - - no wider than slits - - and ... Troy is gay . REBECCA : And then , after Roland died , Biddy discovered she was pregnant with Dixon , so Troy moved back in and helped raise him . And he 's been with them every step of the way . So , Dixon was conceived , uh , before ... I 'll get the family album . Oh , but Poppy , your milk 's almost ready . And anyway , Will has already more or lessseen the family album . I 'll get the family album . REBECCA : Oh , boy . Now you 're in for it . So , how 'd you like my family ? Well , um ...  they 're ... they 're ver-very interesting . Yeah , well . Ah , you did n't see Min Foo at her best . I 'm afraid she 's beginning an old pattern . Uh , have a baby , ditch the husband . Oh , they all are pretty outspoken ... POPPY : Yeah . Is n't that the truth . I mean , everywhere I look . Well . On the refrigerator , in this album . Everybody 's celebrating . I mean , we just drank a toast in there . And now you 've brought me in here , and you 've got me looking at photos of toasts . Years of toasts . Oh , they 're photographs . I mean , you do n't usually take pictures of people reading a book or playing chess . Chess ?  : We-We do n't play chess . WILL : Well , I mean you ... You do have an unusual amount of parties , you 'll have to admit . Every time we try to get together , we have to work around your social events . Social events . WILL : Well , I mean , I understand you 're a social type . Piffle . Oh . Oh . Here 's my Joycie .  She was a cutie all right . Ooh . Yeah . I better haul myself off to bed . Oh , yeah . Yeah , I-I think I 'm , uh ... I 'm gon na go to bed , too . Oh . All right . Oh . Do n't forget my birthday party . Oh , I would n't miss it . Oh , yeah . When is his birthday ? It 's in December . What date in December ? I do n't think we 'll be seeing each other in December , Will . What-What ... What do you mean ? Or before that , either . Was it something that I did ? You did n't do anything , Will . Was it your family ? Did n't ... I mean , did n't they like me ? I 'm sure they liked you ... No , the fact of the matter is , this ... It just wo n't work , Will . It wo n't . I 'm sorry to do this to you . Again .  Good-bye , Will . Good-bye , Will . Well ... all right then . Good-bye , Rebecca . WOMAN : Practically as old as Robert E . Lee himself . Sorry it took so long to come in . Oh ... no , that's-that 's , uh ... that 's all right . Thank you . No , really , really , my life is finished . It finished when the girls got grown ... so here I am , just , you know , hanging around , marking time , waiting for things to wind down . ZEB : Rebecca , are you all right ? Well , yeah . Define " all right . " Where 's Will in all this ? Gone . You ditched him ?  : Yep , but that 's not the problem . The problem is just I 've ... What did George Eliot say ? It 's never too late to do what you want to do . Well , you know , that 's just ... that is just plain wrong . I mean , what if I wanted to - - I do n't know - - what if I wanted to get pregnant ? I mean , Zeb , that 's just ridiculous .   Sorry . I just remembered ; it was n't do what you want to do , it 's be what you want to be , I think . I guess I 'm just so tired . I 'm not even sure it 's George Eliot . Thanks for trying , Zeb . Night . Good night .   There you are , Joe . Ready for another glorious day , helping other people celebrate life .  Happy birthday , Poppy . Oh , thank you , Beck .  Ooh , I got it , I got it . Ooh . Oh , beats me .  No cars , probably no phones . Mm . I wonder from time to time if the years Joycie did n't get to use in her life got added onto mine . Oh , oh , she would 've been glad to see you enjoy it . Ah ... Joycie ... Joyce was a naturally happy person , not like us Daviches . Some people just have a harder time being happy . Oh , boy . The night that I met Joe , oh , he ... he was laughin ' , and then , when I saw him a few days later , through the library window ... oh , I saw that life in his eyes , and I knew right at that moment that I wanted to marry him . You know , I think you might be right , though , about the Daviches , because deep down , I-I-I 'm not sure he was really happy . Your true life is the one you end up with , whatever it may be . You just do the best with what you 've got . This is n't my party , is it ?  : Oh , no ... No , no , Poppy . Your party is going to be everything you dreamed it would be .  Oh , Mother , come here . I want you to meet Tanya . Oh , no , thank you . J.J.J . How do you do ? And J.J . Barrow . Hi . How do you do ? J.J . 's our , uh , handyman . Oh . Are you here as guests ? Yes . Yes , we are . Hey , Poppy , how you doing ? Oh .  Happy birthday , Poppy . Birthday , Poppy . Birthday , Poppy . Whoa , for me ?  : Oh . Whoa , how ' bout that ? President Theodore Roosevelt . President Theodore Roosevelt . He was a great president . Are you really 100 ? Yes , but do n't tell anybody , huh ? " Pick up dry cleaning , " make dental appointment for Peter , " find someone to clean the gutters , buy my bro a birthday gift . " These are the things I was supposed to do last week . So ? Beck , when you and Dad got married , did you ... ? And-and-and do n't take this the wrong way , but did you ever wonder if he 'd married you just so that he would have help with us kids ? I mean , I ... I am trying not to think that of Barry , but I mean , these lists . Oh , what are you saying , that you do n't think that Barry loves you ? He says he does , but , I mean , the PTA meetings , the carpool ... It 's like ... I 'm so useful . There 's no use . Hakim is hopeless . Thanks . I can always rely on my family for emotional support . Oh , Min Foo ... please , could you please just once try to resist dumping a husband once you 've had his baby ? I gave you the name of Patch 's marriage counselor . Patch , you 're going to a marriage counselor ? Thanks a lot , Biddy . Why does everybody in this family seem so unhappy ? Thank goodness for you and Troy . Troy is gay , but we still argue just like every other couple , okay ? How reassuring to hear that . Hey , everybody , Hakim took all of Poppy 's homemade movies and turned them into a tape . They only go up to 1971 , but ... Shh . " Celebrating Paul Davich . "  ZEB : Ah , your famous hamburgers , Poppy . God , I was always good with my barbecue . POPPY : She 's my girl . She looks happy . Oh , man . Oh , I loved that dog . That was Molly . POPPY : Oh , that old train set . Oh , there 's Uncle Zeb . POPPY : I gave him that train . ZEB : And there 's Joe . Dad ... Yeah , he looks good . GIRL : Real bright lights . Uh-huh .  ZEB : Oh , that 's a sweet shot . Look at that .  ZEB : Now , that 's dancing . I should 've been arrested . That 's some nice moves . Our Easter egg hunt . Oh , there 's me . I remember that dress . Well , we all wore it .  Would you look at us ? GIRL : That looks like fun . POPPY : Ooh , what a ... what a bath she 's getting . There you are , Mommy . ZEB : Yahoo , Min Foo . MIN FOO : Dad did n't have a chance . Four girls .  Look at him . He was so handsome . Wow . POPPY : Oh , that 's a good movie . It was beautiful , yeah ! MIN FOO : Good job , Hakim . All right , cake is in the dining room . Yay . MIN FOO : Yeah , more champagne . %% For he 's a jolly good fellow %% %% For he 's a jolly good fellow %% %% For he 's a jolly good fellow %% %% Which nobody can deny . %% What 's wrong ? Oh , it 's the video . It 's as if I never existed . As if what ?   Beck . A toast . Poppy . To Poppy . He 's beginning to seem perennial . We 're observing his centennial , so shout it from the chandeliers . POPPY : I could eat all of this myself . Let me take the baby . I 'll deal with him .    Oh , look at you . I know what you 're thinking . What kind of people have I ended up with ? How am I ever going to live on this planet ? Come over here . Look , look , look .  Miserable day ? Yeah . Beck , you know that was just Patch being Patch . Oh , listen , what do I care ? Before that , Nono asked me if Joe had married me for my usefulness . Oh , believe me , over the years , uh , that crossed my mind , too , especially after he just ... up and died , leaving me to cope with all this . What are you talking about ? Oh ... I should 've just said that to him right then . I was here , too , you know , and I remember you walking into the Open Arms that day , and you were having a wonderful time , and my brother saw in you this gift of joy . Joy ? Yeah , joy . I 'm sure you know that 's something the Davich gene pool sorely lacks . Believe me , you give all of us such joy . Oh , well , it 's not enough . It 's more than enough ; how can we survive without it ? You 'd survive . Not a chance . I do n't know . I know . I know you hold all of us together with your love , with your parties , with your funny Rebecca toasts . Mm . We need you , Rebecca .  Abdul 's hungry , I think . Hmm ... Yeah . You 're so young . Yeah . He 's hungry , honey . Beck , where you been ? Champagne ? Yes , thanks . Mom , I 've run out of diapers . Oh , honey , I think there 's an extra package underneath the sink . Why are n't you in the video ? Well , I guess I was busy planning some happening or other .  Peter ? Do you know I had a dream about us ? Really ? What 'd you dream about ? Well , it was a beautiful , sunny day ... and you and I were on a train . Where were we going ? Well , we were traveling to ... to right here , I guess . We were coming home . Peter , can you come here for a second ? I see you 're having a wonderful time . Yes , Joe ... I really am .  - the end - - -

Katsuji , please get back in line . - Please . If we 're very quiet , we can watch a program being videotaped . Right this way . This week we have our special Salute to Luncheon Meats . Many of you have written , asking how to zing up party appetizers . I 'm very excited about this recipe . It 's so piquant with sherry . Some people use a dash . I use a lot . So let 's just plunge into our hors d'oeuvres , shall we ? You know , these bologna and bean dip roll-ups are so easy when friends drop over . Okay , wait . He did n't eat it after midnight . - I did n't make the rules . - Rules ? What if they 're in an airplane and they cross a time zone ? It 's always midnight somewhere . - Peltzer , is this ... ? - Yes , sir . - Take this , in case it comes back . - Right . Before microwaves , this used to take forever .

Oh , well . The show must go on . So let 's ladle up some of our chowder-noodle ... Run for your lives ! Monster ! Microwave ! You see what these monsters are doing ? They 're throwing metal utensils into the microwave ! Stay here and die ! Wait . Wait ! What is it ? Wait ! - Mr . Katsuji ! Something weird is going on in Studio D . Punch it up on the stack . I show brownouts in five more locations . Climate control malfunction , floors 15 and 16 . What the hell ? The pest infestation monitor is reading critical . What is that ? That could be rats , right ? No , sir . I 'm afraid it 's not . Whatever they are , they 've got ta respect the chain of command . Gizmo , Gizmo , Gizmo , Gizmo ! Light bright !

Have the people in Chinatown give a street festival . A spontaneous flood of appreciation for all I 've done for the community . - And maybe we could have a parade . - Yum-yum ! Call that big department store . They got lots of floats . They keep them in a warehouse in New Jersey . I think I own that . A , B , C , D , J , K ... Coffee ? Let go of my tie ! - Bill ! - Mr . Clamp , sir , are you okay ? Yeah , I think so . I hate using these machines myself . - Sir , we have a problem ... - We have a situation ... Oh , my God . We have to evacuate the building and close it down . - That 's ridiculous . - Before sundown . - What happens at sundown ? - They hate sunlight . It kills them . When it gets dark , they 'll try to leave the building ... Calm down . He should be in custody . He 's dangerous . This thing , that 's dangerous . This guy 's from the art department ... - I said it could be a problem tenant . We could have had three shrinks and a plastic surgeon . Here . Make a wish ! Ah , hair ! Going down !

First , our video watch . Just rereleased on video is Gremlins , though I ca n't imagine why . I know some people found it fun , but I 'd rather have root canal work done . What 's fun about a movie full of ugly , mean-spirited monsters who attack innocent people ? Are we so desperate for entertainment that this trash passes for fun ? Wait a minute ! Look at this . I 've been working on making tomatoes tougher for shipping . - That 's terrific ! - Topnotch ! How do they taste ? That 's the best part . We 've already had calls from two airline chefs . Oh , my gosh ! - Did somebody leave something out ? - Not I . It 's eating my vegetable medley . - What 's that noise ? - I think they 're laughing . - Reptiles do n't laugh ! - They 're not reptiles . Nice boy . There 's a good creature . Now , let 's talk this over . I can get you diseases . You 'd like that , would n't you ? Perhaps not . I wan na talk about what 's going on in here . There are some fascinating ramifications for the future . When you introduce genetic material to our life form which is possessed of a sort of I hesitate to say " atavism " but let us say an aggressive nature . That fellow over there is a common bat of the order of Chiroptera . The only mammals , I might add , capable of true flight . Ah , genetic sunblock ! Yes . Might I have a word with you ? My friend , you have potential . I wan na help you be all that you can be . May I ? As you 're aware , sunlight poses a problem for our ethnic group . We do n't tan or burn . That 'll be useful where you 'll be going . Where he 'll be going ? All they have to do is eat children , there 'd be appalling publicity . There it is . The Apple . The city so nice they named it twice . Check it out one time , wo n't you ? Catch it ! Do n't let it go ! - Down ! - Down ! Here in Manhattan there 's been a steady stream of mechanical problems at the Clamp Centre office building in midtown ... - Buy ! Buy ! - Sell ! Sell ! I 'd say it 's a full-scale panic . Are you having a run on the banks yet ? It 's brutal here . We 're telling clients to invest in canned food and shotguns . Please take a moment to locate the nearest exit . Go to it quickly because of the danger in the building . Please take personal belongings with you . Food fight ! Fire : The untamed element , giver of warmth , destroyer of forests . - This building is on fire . - What ? The building is on fire . Leave the building . Enact the age-old drama of self-preservation . Oh , Murray , the cathedral of Saint Eva Marie . - What a beautiful building ! - Beautiful ? It 's like something out of the Dark Ages . Hey , Quasimodo , you home ? Hey ... - It 's one of them ! - Who ? Get off ! It 's just a flesh wound , Murray ! - Hurry up , Lewis ! - I 'm coming , Martin ! The horror . The horror . The breakage ! Sir , what happened ? They fought back , that 's what happened . Things . Stuff . I swear , I 'll never hurt anything again . Some things man is n't meant to splice . - A problem tenant . - Calm down . - We wo n't renew your lease . Stupid name . But it was n't my idea . Bunny rabbit . " Fourscore and seven years ago ... " Nudie , nudie , nudie ! Mom , I wan na see the Gremlins ! Sir , I ca n't believe this . This is worse than the first one . We just show these movies , we do n't make them . But ... I quit . Call the union , the National Guard . Those things took over the projector . All they wan na see is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . Enough ! I 'll take care of this . Mr . Hulk , we have Gremlins in the projection booth . - Could you help us ? - Gremlins ? In this theater ? Now ? Okay , guys , listen up . People paid money to see this movie . When they go out , they want cold sodas , popcorn and no monsters in the projection booth . Sorry , folks . It wo n't happen again . - I 'm outside the Clamp Centre office building where something strange is taking place inside , though ... - been a day Mr . Clamp would like to forget . - Talking about green creatures . Police are not permitting any news media inside . Once we are allowed in we 'll broadcast live from inside the building . Live from inside . Hey , you ! Come here . No ! Can you work a TV camera ? Work a camera ? I am a camera ! Oh , good ! Come with me . No , this way . This way . I know , you think I 'm insane . No , if you were , we could n't sue you . - Oh , my God . - You see ? This is a complete failure of management . - They 're eating the genetic stuff . - Years of research , patents ! What a hunk ! - Do n't be afraid of your feelings ! - Help ! It 's a hobby I knew would come in handy . I got ordnance here that can drop a charging puma at 50 feet . Oh , why ca n't you commit ? That 's what these things need , a taste of ... Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it off ! To survive a war , you got ta become war . Let us in there . We 'll take responsibility . Most people are out anyway . - What 's in there ? I 've been to Beirut . - I bet they miss you there . The important thing is to keep this out of the media . They get you to say something then they twist and embellish it , and before you know it ... You ca n't do that ... - Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Hold it ! No water . - What ? That 's not a fire in there . They 're gremlins . You get them wet , they 'll multiply . I can deal with them . Sure , pal . Why do n't you calm down ? Just take it easy . Do n't talk to me like I 'm crazy . I 'm not crazy ! I was never crazy . I 'm fine . Let me in there ! Bill , any progress ? Just tell me there 's progress . Things are really bad out there . Bad ? ! Only one of my channels is still on the air . There are human beings in the building . Do you know what kind of lawsuits we 're looking at ? Yes , I know , but ... All of our operators are busy . Your call will be handled in the order received . - What is that ? - One of those things . I thought this would never run . Maybe it will , now . Because of the end of civilization , CCN now leaves the air . We hope you have enjoyed our programming . But more importantly , we hope you have enjoyed life . - It 's beautiful , is n't it ? - Yes , sir . It 's very uplifting . Is there any way to turn the clocks ahead in the building three hours ? There 's nothing we ca n't do . Why ? Sunlight kills them . If we can fool them into thinking the sun has gone down they may go to the lobby . Right ! The front doors are the only way out of the building . - The sun sets at 7:32 . - Then we should move at 4:20 . I like that ! We have information they do n't have . That 's how you take somebody out . Wait a minute . - Good ! I finally get to use my secret exit . - You know , sir ? - Yes ? If you pull this off , you could save the city . Save the city ? " Developer Saves City . " I like that ! Is anyone still employed in this charming facility ? I need light in my office . Now ! At Clamp Enterprises we want you to achieve all you can . Turn on the lights in my office . You want me to work in the dark ? This is new . Hey , that 's Clamp ! Let 's go ! - Has the building been evacuated ? - Is it on fire ? That 's a false alarm . We 've just got some problems . You got a guy in there in a Dracula suit . Are you trying to panic the city ? - So they are real ? - I did n't say that . - What are you saying ? - What I always say . Murray ? Gizmo ? As you probably know ... And in an even more bizarre twist , one of the creatures ... " Creatures . " Is that accurate ? - That one of these creatures is able to talk and he 's going to talk with us right now . The main question people have is : Creature , what is it that you want ? Fred , what we want is what you and your viewers have : Civilization . Yes , but what sort of civilization are you speaking of ? The niceties . The fine points . Diplomacy , compassion , standards , manners , tradition . That 's what we reach toward . We may stumble on the way , but civilization , yes . The Geneva Convention , Susan Sontag . Everything you 've worked hard to accomplish , we aspire to . We wan na be civilized . Take a look at this fellow here . Now , was that civilized ? Clearly not . Fun , but in no sense civilized . None of us has been in New York before . We want the essentials . Dinettes , bedroom groups credit even if we 've been turned down before . Take it easy with that thing . Be careful up there ! What 's that thing for ? These things can only come out when it 's dark . We set the clocks ahead . When they think it 's sunset and see what a nice night it is , they 'll muster in the lobby . The sunlight 'll pour through here and fry them ! Sure . - Is it safe ? - Help ! Billy ! I hate these little things ! - You okay , Billy ? - Yeah . Get me out of here . - Billy ? - Could I get some help here , please ? I 'm trapped in adhesive polymer material and I 'm on deadline ! Darling , it 's you ! Thank God you 're here . Well , I could help you , or I could just leave you here . Listen , about Billy . Okay , it was n't completely business , I 'll be honest . It 'll be an openness thing . I had designs on him . I did n't get to first base . Okay ? - It 'll do . - What a wonderfully prepared woman . What happened to him ? I do n't know . I guess they pushed him too far . - Lf they get out ... - We 'll stop them , Billy . Do n't give up now . Washington did n't . Lincoln ... - Please ! - What ? Do n't mention Lincoln . A terrible thing happened to me once on Lincoln 's birthday . I was 6 or 7 . I had the day off from school . Mama sent me to the park . She made me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . That 's all I ever ate . A man with a beard and hat ... Just like Lincoln . Honey , we do n't have time for this now . I remember ... Oh , God . These guys are n't bad . Incredible as it seems , ladies and gentlemen after their bizarre , bloodcurdling rampage of destruction these strange creatures now appear to be mounting what seems to be a musical number . They 're near the doors . Do n't worry . Soon Mr . Clamp will drop the cloth and let in the sun . Okay , are we ready to drop this thing ? Sunlight ? Say cheese ! They get in the rain , the city will go under . Armageddon ! WWIII ! - Billy , we 've got ta do something . - I know . There 's a fire hose . Aim it into the lobby . Are you crazy ? Just do it , and fast ! Put Gizmo in a box so he does n't get wet . Marla ... - Smoke . - Thanks . Loogie ! Lobby ! Do n't mess with Futterman ! There 's a call on hold in Mr . Clamp 's office . Can you transfer it here ? Yeah , I think so . I 'm singing in the bathtub ! Bypass the file server . - That 's it ! - My God ! Turn off the hose ! Hit it ! I 'm melting ! Oh , what a world , what a world ! The creatures seem to be melting into horrible little green and brown puddles . It 's , it 's like ... Well , I ca n't say what it looks like , on television , but it looks terrible . Let 's go ! Come on ! It 's stuck . Come on . Back up here . Down there . Come on ! Let 's go ! We 'll take them by this door . Come on ! Charge ! I did n't hurt myself . Maybe we can use this stuff for landfill . - We 're here with Daniel R . Clamp . - Hey ! Hey ! Wait a minute , pal ! Who told you to go on my network ? Nobody , sir . It just seemed like news , so ... Six o'clock , weeknights . Go to Barneys and get new clothes . Give this man a credit card . This is Old World . Think sweaters . Think avuncular . Right . Avuncular ! - And my cameraman ? - Off caffeine , he 's okay . - I 'm a hit ! - We 're a hit . What does a menswear makeover cost today ? Join us as we investigate ... And get some sun this weekend ! Hey , Bill ! Oh , boy ! - What 's happening ? - It moved , sir . All right . Carry on . Careful , that stuff 's slippery . So you bailed us out . It was n't just me . We all chipped in . Mr . Futterman and Marla . Marla ? Yes , sir ? You work for me , do n't you ? Yes , sir . Very , very hard . What happened ? They tried it again , but we were ready . - Let 's go . Smells like burnt meatloaf . - It 's Daniel Clamp ! My new head of public relations here will handle all questions . Why , Daniel ! - What happened ? - Where 's the camera ? It was horrible . We had to stop work altogether . - Sorry about the building . - I 'm not . - You 're not ? - No , we 're insured for the damages . Maybe it was n't a place for people anyway . It was a place for things . You make a place for things . Things come . You kept the city safe , sir . That 's right . That 's a good point . The sacrifice . Could be in my next book ! I should take notes . - Who 's got a pencil and paper ? - Here you go . - What 's this ? - Kingston Falls . - I 've looked for this ! - To buy ? No , to build for my next project in Jersey ! This is terrific ! People want the traditional community thing now . - That 's better . I love that ! It 's ... Wait . It 's ... " Clamp Corners . Where life slows down to a crawl . " - What do you think ? - It 's terrific . This is what people want , not talking elevators . You sell me this design , and we 'll build the biggest most sensational quiet little town ever . - But for him to do an entire town ... - We can come to a deal . - Are you Mrs . Peltzer ? - Yes ! Well , I 'm gon na be . - What 's that ? - This is Gizmo . - He 's a Mogwai . - Mogwai . - I look at him , you know what I see ? - What , sir ? Dolls with suction cups staring out car windows . A Macy 's parade float . Have you thought about merchandising ? - Me ? No . - Yeah ! There 's something there . Lose the headband , though . Most buildings would n't stand up to this ... Go home now . No visit to New York is complete without touring the world 's most ... - Put a glaze of cheese on top . - Your favorite . - Yeah , sure . Showtime ! MTV . - Are you coming ? - In a minute . - HBO . - What did he say ? He wants cable . - Nick at Nite ? - No . - Have a cigarette ? - No . I 'll quit . - From the building . - In the building ? Hello ? Forster , what are you ... ? Okay , we 'll get you out . What floor ? Way up there ! Lt 'll take a while . The elevators are out . So are the automatic doors . I do n't know , not long . We 'll do what we can . Keep your pants on . - You 've been working too hard . - Maybe I have , Mr . Clamp . - Take a day off . Thank you , sir . Long , is n't it ? Patently ridiculous ! Still lurking about ? Do n't you people have homes ? That 's ... Oh , no , you do n't ! Sorry , 60 years of hogging the end title is enough ! So that 's all , folks ! Fade out ... ! 
@@5217141 Yes . Quite dead . As a doornail . Certificate of death , sir . Stop ! Back away , praddock . Tuppence is tuppence . - Beg your pardon ! - I say ! Delinquents . Newspaper ! We 're hungry , sir ! - Please , sir , we 're very hungry . - Any morsel . We 're hungry , sir . - Any scraps . - We 're starving , Please , sir . We 're very hungry . Merry Christmas , from his lordship , the mayor ! - Please , sir . - Oh , look . There it is . Oi ! Come back here with that ! That 's our meat ! Give it back ! That 's ours ! Come back here ! - There you are , sir . - Thanks . Fresh hot chestnuts . - How would you like this one ? - That 's perfect . That 's a nice fresh eel . Here is the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost . Get lost . And under which one is the pea ? Boom , boom , boom , boom ... Boom ! Merry Christmas , Uncle ! - God save you . - Bah ! Humbug ! Christmas a humbug ? Uncle ! You do n't mean that . Merry Christmas . What reason have you to be merry ? You 're poor enough . What right have you to be so dismal ? You 're rich enough . - Humbug ! - Do n't be cross , Uncle . What else can I be when I live in such a world of fools as this ? Merry Christmas . What 's Christmastime to you but a time for paying bills without money . A time for finding yourself a year older and not a penny richer . If I could work my will , every idiot who goes about with " Merry Christmas " on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart ! - Uncle ! - Nephew ! Keep Christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine . Keep it ? But you do n't keep it ! There are many things from which I have derived good and have not profited . Christmas being among them . But I have always thought of Christmas as a kind , charitable time . The only time when men open their shut-up hearts and think of all people as fellow travelers to the grave and not some other race of creatures bound on other journeys . And therefore , Uncle , although it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket , I believe it has done me good , and I say , God bless it ! Let me hear another sound out of you , Cratchit , and you 'll keep Christmas by losing your situation ! You 're quite a powerful speaker , sir . A wonder you do n't go into Parliament . Do n't be cross , Uncle . Come , dine with us tomorrow . I 'll see you in hell first . But why ? Why so cold-hearted , Uncle ? Why ? Why did you get married ? Because I fell in love . I ask nothing of you . - Why ca n't we be friends ? - Good afternoon . I 'm sorry , with all my heart , to find you so resolute . But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas , and therefore , - merry Christmas , Uncle ! - Good afternoon ! - And a happy New Year ! - Good afternoon ! And a very merry Christmas to you too , Mr . Cratchit . Merry Christmas to you , sir . There 's another one . A clerk making 15 shillings a week and with a wife and family , talking about a merry Christmas . I 'll retire to Bedlam . Good afternoon . Scrooge and Marley 's , I believe ? Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr . Scrooge or Mr . Marley ? Mr . Marley has been dead these seven years . He died seven years ago ... this very night . Well , we have no doubt that his generosity is well represented by his surviving partner . Many thousands are in want of common comfort , sir . Are there no prisons ? Prisons ? Yes , yes , plenty of prisons . And the union workhouses , are they still in operation ? They are . I wish I could say they were not . The treadmill in full vigor ? - Very busy , sir . - Good ! I was afraid something had occurred to stop them in their useful course . Yes . At this festive season , a few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth . What shall we put you down for ? - Nothing . - Oh , you wish to remain anonymous ? I wish to be left alone ! I do n't make merry myself at Christmas , and I ca n't afford to make idle people merry . I support the establishments I have mentioned . And those who are badly off must go there . Then they had better do it and decrease the surplus population . Good afternoon , gentlemen ! Good afternoon . You 'll want all day tomorrow , I suppose ? Well , if quite convenient , sir . It 's not convenient , and it 's not fair . If I were to dock you a half a crown for it , you 'd think yourself ill-used . And yet you do n't think me ill-used when I pay a day 's wages for no work . Well , it 's only once a year , sir . Poor excuse for picking a man 's pocket every 25th of December . But I suppose you must have the whole day . Be here all the earlier the next morning . Sir . In honor of Christmas Eve ! Bugger it ! Where are you ? Here ! Why does everything seem to happen to me ? Get away ! Get away ! Balderdash ! I have given myself the willies . That 's what it is . It 's all still a hum ... - Who are you ? - Ask me who I was . Who were you then ? In life , I was your partner , Jacob Marley . Can you sit down ? - I can . - Do it then . You do not believe in me . I do n't . Why do you doubt your senses ? Because the littlest thing can affect them . A slight disorder of the stomach can make them cheat . You may be an undigested bit of beef . A blot of mustard . A crumb of cheese . A fragment of underdone potato . There 's more of gravy than of grave about you , whatever you are . Mercy ! Dreadful apparition , why do you trouble me ? Man of worldly mind , do you believe in me or not ? I do ! I must ! Woe ! Woe is me ! You are fettered in chains . Why ? I wear the chain I forged in life . I made it link by link and yard by yard . Oh , yours is a ponderous chain . Jacob , tell me no more . Speak comfort to me , Jacob . I have none to give . I can not stay . I can not linger anywhere . Mark me , in life , my spirit never walked beyond our countinghouse , never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole . Now endless journeys lie before me . Seven years dead and traveling all the time ? The whole time . No rest , no peace . You must 've covered a lot of ground in seven years . I was blind ! Blind ! I could not see my own life ! Squandered and misused . Oh , woe ... Oh , woe is me ! But you were always a good man of business ! Business ! Mankind ... was my business . The common welfare was my business . Charity , mercy , forbearance , and benevolence were all my ... Hear me ! Pray . I am here to warn you that you have yet a chance and a hope of escaping my fate . A chance of my procuring , Ebenezer . You were always a good friend to me , Jacob . Thank ' ee . You will be haunted by three spirits . That 's the chance and hope ? - I 'd rather not . - Expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one . Could n't I take them all at once , and have it over with , Jacob ? Expect the second the next night at the same hour . And the third upon the next night , when the last stroke of 12 has ceased to vibrate . Look to see me no more . I 'm sorry . I wish I could help you . Are you the spirit whose coming was foretold to me ? I am . I meant nothing by it . I meant no offense . I just thought I ... Who and what are you ? I am the Ghost of Christmas Past . Long past ? Your past . Rise . And walk with me . But I am mortal and liable to fall . Bear but a touch of my hand there and you shall be upheld in more than this . Good heavens . I was bred in this place . I was a boy here . Your lip ... is trembling . And what 's that ? - On your cheek ? - Nothing . Something in my eye . Do you remember the way ? Remember it ? I could walk it blindfolded . Giddyup ! Giddyup ! These are but shadows of things that have been . They have no consciousness ... of us . I knew them . I know every one of them . They were schoolmates of mine . Let 's go on . This ... This was my school . This school is not quite deserted . Poor boy . Poor , poor boy . Let 's ... see another Christmas . Ebenezer ! Ebenezer ! Dear , dear brother ! I 've come to bring you home ! - Home , little Fan ? - Yes , home ! Father is so much kinder than he used to be . He spoke so gently to me one night . I was not afraid to ask him if you might come home . And he said yes ! And he sent me in a coach to fetch you . And we 're to be together all the Christmas long . And to have the merriest time in all the world ! You 're quite a woman , little Fan . - She had a large heart . - She died a woman . And had , as I think children . Yes , one child . True . - Your nephew . - Yes . Do you know this place ? Know it ? I was an apprentice here ! Why , it 's old Fezziwig . Bless his heart ! Dick ! Come on ! It 's 6:00 . They 're going to be here soon . Dick Wilkins . Bless me , yes . There he is , Dick Wilkins . He was very attached to me , was Dick . Yo-ho , me lads ! No more work tonight . It 's Christmas Eve ! Hooray ! Dick , Ebenezer , let 's get cleared away . We want lots of space . Lots and lots of space . Hee-hi ! Maestro ! May I present ? ! Well done ! Well done ! And now , kind fiddler , if you please . It is time for Sir Roger de Coverley ! Might I have this dance with you ? Ebenezer , it 's your pass . - Another idol has replaced me . - Another idol ? What idol ? A golden one . There is nothing on this earth more terrifying to me than a life doomed to poverty . - Changed ? Perhaps grown wiser , but I have not changed toward you . Our contract is an old one . It was made when we were both poor and content to be so . When it was made ... - You were another man . - I was a boy ! I release you , Ebenezer . Have I ever sought release ? - In words , no . - In what , then ? In an altered spirit . In another atmosphere of life . In everything that made my love of any worth in your sight . Tell me , Ebenezer , if this contract had never been between us , would you seek me out now ? No . You think not ? I would gladly think otherwise if I could . But if you were free today , would you choose a dowerless girl ? A girl left penniless by the death of her parents ? You , who weighs everything by gain ? I release you , Ebenezer . May you be happy in the life you 've chosen . They are what they are . Do not blame me . Remove me . I can not bear it . Leave me ! Take me back ! Haunt me no longer ! Oh , blast ! Enter , Scrooge ! Come in ! Come in and know me better , man ! I am the Ghost of Christmas Present . Look upon me ! You have never seen the likes of me before ? Never . Have never walked forth with my elder brothers ? I do n't think that I have . You have many brothers ? More than 1,800 . 1,842 , to be exact . I see you wear a scabbard , but no sword . Indeed . Peace on Earth . Goodwill toward men . Spirit , conduct me where you will . Touch my robe . What 's happening ? What are you doing ? - Very strange . - Indeed . Not many mortals are granted a heavenly perspective of man 's world . Yes . It 's quite beautiful . Hear me , Scrooge . There are some upon this earth of yours who claim to know me and my brothers , and do their deeds of ill will and selfishness in our name . These so-called " men of the cloth " are as strange to me and my kin as if they never lived . Charge their doings to them , not us . Aye . I will . Smell that ? Cooking goose ! Come on ! I take it this bleak paupers ' dwelling is of some significance . It is all your loyal clerk can afford for his meager 15 bob a week . - Mother ! - Papa ! We just came by the baker shop . And smelled our goose , cooking delicious . Shut the door , please . What happened to your precious father ? And your brother . And Martha , she was n't as late last Christmas Day . Mother , here she is , Mother . ' T is a wonderful one . Peter , off with you to the baker 's and collect the bird . And take the children with you . And pray , no dallying . Why , bless your heart alive ! Dear , how late you are ! We had a deal of work to finish up last night and clear away this morning . Never mind . Long as you 're here . Sit ye down before the fire and have a warm . No . No , no , no . There 's Father coming . Hide , Martha . You must hide . Hide , Martha . - It 's cold out there . - Hello , Father . Hello , Timmy . Why , where 's our Martha ? Not coming . Not coming ? Not coming upon Christmas Day ? Here I am , Father ! We got you , Father . I could n't bear to see you in a state of disappointment . If only for a giggle . It 's so lovely to see you , my Martha . Shall we have a look , then ? - How did little Timmy behave ? - As good as gold . And better . Somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much , and he thinks the strangest things you ever heard . He told me , coming home , that he hoped the people sawed him in church , because he was a cripple and it might make pleasant for them to remember it upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see . I believe he grows more hearty and stronger every day , my dear . The pudding looks delicious ! The whole wash house smells like a pastry cook 's shop . Spirit , tell me , will Tiny Tim ? I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner and a crutch without an owner . Carefully preserved . - Hurrah ! - The Christmas goose ! Make space . Let 's get that cover off . Lovely ! Well done , Peter . I do n't believe I 've ever seen a more magnificent goose cooked . But I 'll pray that one Christmas , perhaps , the children might taste a turkey . Perhaps one day , my dear . Perhaps one day . A toast . To Mr . Scrooge . The founder of our feast . Founder of the feast , indeed . I wish I had him here . I 'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon , and I 'd hope he 'd have a good appetite for it . My dear , the children ... It 's Christmas Day . Christmas Day , I 'm sure . How can one drink the health of such an odious , stingy , hard , unfeeling man as Mr . Scrooge ? As you know he is , Robert . Nobody knows it better than you . My dear , Christmas Day . I 'll drink his health for your sake and the day 's , not for his . A merry Christmas and a happy New Year . He 'll be very merry and very happy , I have no doubt . God bless us , everyone . - Merry Christmas and happy New Year . - God bless . Kind spirit , say Tiny Tim will be spared . If these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die . - Die ! No , spirit . No . What then ? If he is to die , he had better do it . And decrease the surplus population . - So you 're thinking of an animal ? - Yes . - A live animal ? - Yes . - A rather disagreeable animal ? - Yes . - A savage animal ? - Yes . Wait , wait ! Is it an animal that grunts and growls ? Yes ! - And lives in London ? - Yes . - A horse ? - No . - A cow ? - No . - A dog ? - A pig ? - No . - An ass ? Yes and no . I know who it is , Fred ! I know ! It 's your Uncle Scrooge ! Yes ! And he believes it . I have no patience with him , Fred . I have . I 'm sorry for him . Who suffers from his ill whims ? Only himself . He decides to dislike us , wo n't come and dine with us , and what 's the consequence ? He loses a dinner . - Indeed , he loses a very good dinner . - Hear , hear . A magnificent dinner . Great . He 's certainly given us plenty of merriment , that 's for sure , and I think it would be ungrateful not to drink to his health . He would n't take it from me , but he may have it nevertheless . A merry Christmas to the old man , whatever he is . Uncle Scrooge . To Uncle Scrooge . Are spirits ' lives so short ? My life upon this globe is very brief . It ends tonight . - Tonight ? - Tonight at midnight . Hark . The time is drawing near . Forgive me but I see something strange protruding from your skirt . - Look here . - Naff off ! - Oh , man . Look here . - You daft old geezer . Look ! Look ! Down here ! - Go away ! - Are they yours ? They are man 's . This boy is Ignorance . This girl is Want . Beware them both . Have they no refuge ? No resource ? Are there no prisons ? Are there no workhouses ? Am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come ? You 're about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen . Is that so , spirit ? Ghost of the Future , I fear you more than any specter I have seen . But I know your purpose is to do me good . I am prepared to bear you company . Lead on . The night is waning fast . It 's precious time to me . Lead on , spirit . - I thought he 'd never die . What 's he done with his money ? Has n't left it to me . That 's all I know . It is likely to be a cheap funeral . For the life of me , I ca n't think of anyone who 'd want to attend it . I do n't mind going ... if lunch is provided . There , yes . What a frightful fellow . - All right . - Good day , gentlemen . Get ahold of yourself , Ebenezer . You 're having a wobbly . You wo n't get me in here . Christmas pudding , no doubt . I 'm ... I 'm on Lime Street . Come now . Merry Christmas , Joe . And happy New Year , to be sure . Come in . Sit down in me parlor and let 's have a look . Here . What do you call these , Mrs . Dilber , huh ? Mrs . Dilber ? Bed curtains . Well , I sha n't hold back my hand when I can get something by it ... Do n't you go getting grease on them blankets now . - His blankets ? - Whose else do you think ? He wo n't be feeling the cold without them now , I dare say . I hope he did n't die of anything catching . Do n't you be afeard of that . I ai n't so fond of his company that I 'd loiter about . You can look through that shirt till your eyes ache , and you wo n't find one hole in it . - It was the best he had . - Mrs . Dilber ! Would have been wasted , only for me . - You 're fired ! Fired ! - How did you mean " wasted " ? Somebody was fool enough to put it on him to be buried in . But I took it off him . If he 'd had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death , instead of lying there , all alone , gasping out his last breath well , we would n't have these things to sell now , would we ? Spirit ! I see ! I see ! The case of this unhappy man who dies a solitary , lonesome death might be my own . My life tends that way now . Merciful heavens ! What 's this ? Spirit , this is a fearful place . When I leave it , I shall not leave its lesson . Trust me . Let 's go ! I understand . And I would , if I could , but I have not the power . Spirit , if there is any person who feels emotion caused by this man 's death , show that person to me , I beg you . - Are we ruined ? - There is hope yet . Hope ? Only if he relents . He is past relenting . And even if we do n't , it 's unlikely any new creditor will ever be so merciless . We shall sleep tonight with light hearts , my dear . Let me see some tenderness connected to death , or this chamber will forever haunt me ! It 's late . Past your father 's time . He 's walked slow these last few evenings . Oh , he has walked with Tiny Tim on his shoulders ... fast , indeed . But he was very light to carry , and your father loved him so . - Father . - You went today , then ? Yes , my dear . I wish you could have gone . Would have done you good to see how green a place it is . You 'll see it often . And I promised him I would walk there every ... every Sunday . My little child ! My little child . Father , please do n't be grieved . Please , Father . I 'm sure none of us will ever forget our poor Tiny Tim . - Oh , no , Father . - Never ever . Thank you . Thank you , my dears . Bob . Specter ... something tells me our parting moment is at hand . Tell me who ... was that man we saw lying dead ? Spirit before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point , answer me one question ! Are these the shadows of things that will be or shadows of things that may be ? Men 's courses in life foreshadow certain ends . But if these courses are departed from , these ends will change . Is n't that so ? No . No ! Am I that man who lay upon the bed ? No . Spirit , hear me ! I 'm not the man I was ! Why show me this if I 'm past all hope ? Spirit ! Spirit , assure me that I may change these shadows you 've shown me ! Change them by an altered life !.. help me ! Spirit ! Help me , spirit ! Help , spirit ! Spirit , I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year . I will not shut out the lessons of the past , nor present , nor future . Oh , please , spirit , tell me I may sponge away the writing on that stone ! Still here ? They 're still here . I 'm still here . I 'm still here . I 'm still here ! I do n't know what to do . I 'm light as a feather , merry as a schoolboy . I 've heard that laugh before . - I say , what 's today ? - Eh ? - What 's today , my fine fellow ? - Today ? Why , Christmas Day . It 's Christmas Day ? I have n't missed it . The spirits have done it all in one night . They can do anything they like . Of course they can . Of course they can . Hello , my fine fellow . - What an intelligent boy . Do you know whether they 've sold the prize turkey that was hanging there ? Not the little prize turkey , the big one . - The one as big as me ? - What a delightful child . - Yes , my buck . - It 's hanging there now . Is it ? Go and buy it , then ! - Walker ! - No , no , I 'm in earnest . Go and buy it , bring it back here , and I 'll give you a shilling . Come back in less than five minutes , and I 'll give you a half a crown . I 'll send it to Bob Cratchit 's . He sha n't know who sent it . It 's twice the size of Tiny Tim . Mrs . Dilber . Merry Christmas ! Oh , my God ! He 's gone mad ! My dear Mrs . Dilber , you 're the loveliest creature I have ever laid eyes upon . Scrooge ! Unhand me ! He 's completely deranged ! Help ! What a charming woman . Help ! I shall love it as long as I live . What an honest face it has . Hello . Here 's the bird . Hello ! Whoop ! How are you ? Merry Christmas . Why , it 's impossible to carry that to Camden Town . You must have a cab . Drive on , my good man ! Hilly-ho ! Chirrup ! Hip , hip ! Chirry-up ! Bob 's your uncle ! Fanny 's your aunt ! Here 's your aunt 's fanny . Live it up , folks ! You 'll be a long time dead ! Do n't let the worms have all the fun . Merry Christmas . Good morning , sir . A merry Christmas to you . - And to you , sir . - Happy holiday ! And a merry Christmas to you . - " God bless you , sir . " - Thank you , sir . Glad tidings . Sir . Mr . Scrooge ? Yes . That is my name , and I fear it may not be pleasant to you . But allow me to ask your pardon . And will you have the goodness ... Lord bless me ! - My dear Mr . Scrooge , are you serious ? - And not a farthing less . A great many back payments are included in it , I assure you . My dear sir , I do n't know what to say to such ... Do not say anything . I 'm much obliged to you . Many thanks to you . And bless you . - Is your master at home ? - Yes , sir . I 'm ... his uncle . Is it an animal that grunts and growls ? Yes . - And lives in London ? - Yes . - A horse ? - No . - A cow ? - No . A dog . - A pig . - No . An ass . Yes and no ... Uncle Scrooge ? Well , bless my soul . I 've ... come to dinner if you 'll have me . Of course , Uncle ! Welcome ! Welcome ! Merry Christmas ! Everybody , this is my uncle , Ebenezer . Be good and pass this . Here you go . Enjoy . Next year we must have this dinner at my house . I insist . I 'll spare no expense . After all , you ca n't take it with you , can you ? No , you ca n't . A full 16 minutes late . What do you mean by coming here at this time of day ? I 'm very sorry , sir . I am a bit behind in my time . You are , indeed . Step in here . Well , it 's only once a year , sir . It shall not be repeated . I was making rather merry yesterday . Now , I 'll tell you what , Mr . Cratchit . A merry Christmas to you , Bob . A merrier Christmas , Bob , my good fellow , than I 've given you in many a year . I 'll raise your salary , and do whatever I can to help your struggling family . And we 'll discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a bowl of Christmas punch . But first , let 's make up the fires . I want you to go out and buy another scuttle of coal before you dot another " I , " Bob Cratchit . Off with you , Bob . We 've wassailing to do . Hilly-ho , Bob ! Yeah . Yes , sir . Right away , sir . And Scrooge was better than his word . He did all that he said he would and more . And to our Tiny Tim , who got well , Scrooge was like a second father . He became as good a friend , as good a master and as good a man as the good old city ever knew . And so , as Tiny Tim observed ... God bless us , everyone .

Why must you spent so many hours at the hospital when you 've a perfectly surgery at home ? It 's research , Gerda ! Research , as I 've explained before . - Why are you slowing ? - It might be about to turn red . - But it is n't , is it ? It 's green . - Oh ! Sorry ... I just become convinced it 'd suddenly ... Oh , God , Gerda ! Gudgeon ! Hello , Midge ! Great to see you ! - What a gorgeous car ! - He 's a Legonda . Goes like the wind ! I suppose that , by the time you take that magificent steed of yours to the stable , give it a rub down and a nosebag , lunch might be ready . - Who 's coming ? - The Christow . - And Edward 's arriving after lunch . - Good . Looks like you 'll have some company , Mr . Poirot . Someone has taken the cottage next door . Mr . Poirot ! Enchant ? , Madame . Everything is beautiful , as usual . But tell me , someone has taken up residence at Dovecotes ? Yes , sir . A lady . An actrice , they say . How 's the dreaded dress shop ? Bloody awful ! - Hello there ! - Edward ! Hello , Midge ! Hello , Henrietta ! But tell me , Madame Simms , what is this ? I did not expect any mail to this address . It 's from Lady Angkatell , up at The Hollow . Anytime . Anytime at all . You are sweet . And Ainswick is the best place in the world . Do you remember our special tree ? Igdrasil . The secret sign we used to draw everywhere ? Fancy a breath here ? My God ! Igdrasil . Who drew that ? You did . So , what 've you been doing , since I saw you last ? Nothing . That sounds ... peaceful . You could find peace at Ainswick , with me . I wish I was n't so dreadfully fond of you , Edward . Makes it so much harder to go on saying " no " . What you really mean is that you wo n't marry me because of John Christow . - Why does n't the fellow get a divorce ? - Because ... That 's it , is n't it ? If there 'd be no John Christow in the world , you 'd marry me . I used to spent my holidays with Edward , at Ainswick . It seemed so vast . 14. - Why did n't you inherit it , Lucy ? - Midge , you know very well girls do n't inherit . It 's the way the world wags . Edward is n't even my cousin , he 's family 's second cousin . But he 's still in tail . Ainswick falls like rain , right plop in his lap . - Are n't you remotely bitter about that ? - No , of course not . I 've invited that crime fellow for dinner . I 'm sorry ? That 's why I was in your bedroom so early , this morning . I had this premonition , you see . That we were to have terrible foughts , for dinner . So , him being here , just could be a distraction . What crime man , Lucy ? He was in Bagdad when Henry was High-Comissionary . He stays in one of those funny little cottages , down the lane . I mean , once you 're dead , you 're dead it does n't matter why , does it ? I 'm no good in anything . I do n't know why you ever married me . You needed taking care of , that 's why I married you . I try to be a good wife , John . This may not be the best time to tell you ... You know I love you , do n't you ? Of course I know , but I have to warn you ... No one else , just you . We 'll never make it to Shovel Down in third . Very fair shooting , Edward . Now , there . Your turn , Henrietta . See if you can kill a burglar . - Well done ! - No , you only winged him . Hello , everyone ! Hello , Henry ! - It 's the Christow ! - Hello . So sorry we 're late . - Try to put one in bullseye . I 've never tried . - Hello , darling . - Darling . - I think you may have met Midge Hardcastle ? - Yes , of course . And of course you know my second cousin , Edward . - How do you do , Edward ? - Hello , John . - What 's going on ? - Henry 's brought the artillery . Has he indeed ? I sprang my bloody wrist . Careful . Did I miss ? I bet I missed . My turn , is it ? Gerda , how lovely to see you ! Thank you , Henry . Come along , Gudgeon . I say , Lucy ! That 's nothing . Once , on the Asian side of the Bosphorus , I was jumped by a couple of thugs . We were rolling about in the dirt , we were . Then , before I knew it , she 'd shot one in the leg and one in stomach . You do it very quickly and you do n't think about it , Henry . Sena has in ballet class . Point shoes , the whole lot . - And Terence ? - Chemistry . Always trying to blow things up . He 's planning to make nitroglycerine while were away . - But do n't tell John anything . - Oh , I shan't . - And you ? - Oh , I 've taken up Leathercraft . Do you like this ? I made it . It 's so nice talking to you . But I suppose it will soon be time for dinner . Gerda why do you come here if you hate it so much ? I want John to be happy . - He could come without you . - No , he would n't like that . He would n't enjoy it without me . He said so . John is overly unselfish . I 'd rather stay in Harley Street , to be frank , but he thinks it is good for me , to get out into the country . Come on , let 's go in and get changed . There 's some sort of detective coming in , apparently . You would n't believe it . Monsieur Poirot has habilities one has to say , quite phenomenal . It 's absolutely true , the talk about there was in Bagdad . Monsieur Poirot and his little " green " cells . Grey , Madame . Pardon me . But we 're awfully lucky to have him as a neighbour . I mean , in case anything went wrong . Would you give it all up if I asked you to ? And come and live with me ? No . No ? It 's not really what you want . Could n't you lie to me , just once ? - Why ? - Because I love you , Henrietta . But you 're so ... damn it all , so detached . Your art , your cars , your friends . I want you to think you only need me . Why not ? I like Gerda . - Dinner , Milady . - Thank you , Gudgeon Please , Monsieur Poirot . Come this way . Merci . Has anyone seen John ? Well , the customers are awful ! One has to put up far more insolence in a dress shop than Gudgeon or Simmons or any decent domestic does here . It must be absolute hell , darling . But why does one has to be so proud ? Anyone having to earn one 's living , does n't have to be the end , has it ? It 's all about self-esteem , surely ? You 're the expert on that . So , how do you do it then , Monsieur Poirot ? I beg your pardon , Mademoiselle ? To solve so many crimes ? Merely I use the process of the thought logic and once the process it has been applied , alors , the mistery becomes ? clair ? and the criminal mind it is uncovered . Logically . Oh , I think it does . What happens if you come across one who 's cleverer than yourself ? This is not the highest probability , Mademoiselle . Have you ever been to Deauville , Monsieur ... ? Careful , sir . Henrietta has a very sharp tongue . After dinner , we use to play games . Perhaps charades . But tonight I think it would be most appropriate , if we were to essay the Murder Game . Lucy , do n't you think Monsieur Poirot would be rather bored ... Someone has to pretend to be dead . Murdered . And then we all have to find out who did it . It 's such fun ! It usually turns out to be Gudgeon . Lady Angkatell , it 's a proposition that is most delightful , but I 'm one who retires early to his bed . Your dinner , it was superb . Mademoiselle , I hope that we shall resume our conversation at another time . I 'd like that , Monsieur Poirot . - Sir Henry . - Thank you . I know ! You must come to lunch tomorrow . Oh , yes ! He must , must n't he ? Pardon , but tomorrow I am engag ? . Nonsense , there 's absolutely nothing to do around here , for miles and miles and miles . I insist you come to our sunday lunch . Henry , tell him I do not take kindly to being disobeyed . We 'd be very pleased to have you , old man . Et bien . It will be my pleasure to attend . Thank you . Bonne nuit . Good night , Mr . Poirot . - Good night . - Good night . Ace of diamonds . Why on earth did you lead that diamond , Gerda ? Oh ! I ... was it wrong ? Do n't be absurd , she had to lead the diamond . The only sane thing to do . Game and rubber . Well done . - Wait , did we win ? - A lucky finesse ! - You cheated . - Who the devil are you ? - Veronica Cray , Sir Henry . Please , please , forgiving me for barging in upon you like this . I 'm the dinky little house , up the lane and I 've had the most frightful catastrophe . Please , come on in . Henry , close the window . What happened ? I 've run out of matches . On a Saturday night ! And I smoke like a chimney ... truly . I feel a complete fool , but there 's not a match in Dovecotes so I 've come to beg some from my only neighbours within miles and ... - My God ! - Hello , Veronica . My God , it 's John Christow ! Matches , was it ? This is too , too extraordinary ! - Do you know each other ? - We did a long time ago . - Yes , John 's an old friend . He was the first guy I was ever in love with . Were n't we really madly in love ? Veronica , this is my wife . How lovely to meet you . Ah , Gudgeon , tell me , do we have plenty of matches in the house ? - A dozen boxes came today , milady . - Excellent . - Would you kindly get six ? - Very good , milady . And ... how do you like Dovecotes ? Oh , I adore it ! It 's so cute and so close to London ... And , yet , we feel so gloriously isolated . We kindda lost touch when I went to California , did n't we ? - You 've been to California ? - Oh , I live there , actually . I just popped over to do a little play . One has to keep up to hand , and say hello to Shaftesbury Avenue and all that . My dear Lady Angkatell , I surely wo n't need all these . We have plenty in the house . Will you see me back to my cottage ? I want dreadfully to know what you 've been up to in all those years and years , since I 've seen you . I 'm so sorry to have bothered you in this pathetic way , Lady Angkatell , - Night , night . - Good night . - That was Veronica Cray ! - Indeed . We must catch up one of her pictures , Henry . If that little performance is anything to go by , we will certainly get our money 's worth . - I assure it 's true - It ca n't be ! - I 'm not joking ... - No , it 's not true ! It is true . Come on , John . Come on . What time is it ? Uh ... I've-- I 've no idea . Sorry to wake you . I had to go in for a drink with the woman . Good night , John . Good night . Morning . - Morning . - Morning . - You wan na come ? No , thanks . I feel a bit shattered , to be honest . For me ? It came this morning , sir . We have to talk about our future . I 'm sorry ? Our future , John ! We 've wasted 12 years . I 'm not going back to the States . I 'm going to make my life here , with you . You 've this you 've got this taped out all wrong . We had quite a time together , last night , but Veronica , you know our lives are completely divergent . I mean , when we split up , 12 years ago , well , ... that was just it . We split up . We did n't split up . You ditched me . I was your fianc ? e and you ditched me ! I could n't go with you to Hollywood . I had to finish Med School . Of course , to being a doctor . I have children ! I know . I 'm married myself , at the moment . It 's nothing a good divorce lawyer ca n't fix . John ... I always did want to be your wife . You see , I have this passion , this overpowering passion ! - We have to be together . - No . That is not going to happen ! - But last night ... - Last night ... ? Look , you 're not a child ! Last night was a one off . Are you saying you do n't love me ? You are a very , very alluring woman , Veronica , but I do n't ... love you , no . I came all this way to find you ! Waited in this ghastly hovel  for the weekend for you to be here ! You see I knew that if we could be , just once more , together , ... just once more You - - you planned it ? You belong to me , John . You 're mine ! Because my career is so much more important than yours . Anyone can be a doctor . You 're a nasty piece of work ! You leave me again , I 'll really make you sorry ! So be it ! Goodbye . I hate you more than I thought I could hate anyone ! Good day , sir . Lady Angkatell would like you to come to the pavillion , sir , for a glass of cherry . - Out of doors ? - Would you care to follow me , sir ? Merci . Milady ? I see that you are playing the " Murder Game " . Alors , tr ? s bien . I congratulate you all . Henrietta ... - Allow me , madam . - Give that to me , Gerda ! Mademoiselle , do no ... Poirot ? What 's happened ? Gerda has mur ... I mean ... John has been shot . He 's dead . Is n't really my line , murder . and that nobody tampers with the evidence . It 's ... it 's a bit chilly . - You alright if we wait in the pavillion ? - Oui , bien s ? r . Can I offer you a cherry ? Non , merci . It 's better not to touch . - I suppose we can smoke . - Oui . Non , non , merci . A very able fellow , Christow . Very able . Slightly too able , if you take my meaning . I just do n't know what to do about lunch . It seems so heartless to be seating around a table , stuffing oneself as if nothing had happened . Do n't worry on my account , Lucy . God bless you , dear Edward , but say what you will , murder is a very awkward thing . It upsets the servants so , breaks whole routine out . The worst of all , it was duck for lunch , my very , very favourite ! I 've placed sandwiches and some coffe in the dining-room , milady . Gudgeon , thank you ! Gudgeon really is a jewel , you know ? And a proper , substantial sandwich is as good as lunch . And there 's nothing remotely heartless about them , if you know what I mean . - Lucy , do n't ! This is all so awful ! - Oh ! Midge ! Do n't cry , little Midge . Monsieur Poirot , this is Inspector Grange . I expect you 've heard about Monsieur Poirot . - I most certainly have . - Inspector . May I ask you what brings you to these " neck o da woods " ? Well , I visit this " neck of the woods " , Inspector , for the weekends . My friends persuaded me to purchase a cottage here . It is the second one , in that way , along the lane . And that path leads to the farm and that 's where Lady Angkatell came ? Edward Angkatell and Miss Savernake came from the woods separately and then they stood there and there ? Oui , it was like one mis-en-sc ? ne from the theatre . I 'm giving Gerda some brandy . Oh , how thoughtful of you , Henrietta . Yes , I was remembering , we were given a brandy , for shock , when I was a little girl , at Ainswick . Of course , I suppose it 's not exactly a shock with Gerda , is it ? Personally , I do n't know how I would feel if I 'd just murdered my husband , but would n't exactly be shock , would it ? I mean , there would n't be no element of surprise . Why are you so sure that Gerda killed John ? It seems so evident . Oh ! Well , fortunately , duck is ... quite pleasant cold . I could n't lie down any longer . I still ca n't believe that it 's real . That John is dead . Who could have killed him ? Who could possibly have killed John ? This is my wife , Inspector Grange . Lady Angkatell . I was hoping to have a word with Mrs . Christow . There she is . - Mrs . Christow ? - Yes , I 'm Gerda Christow . I should just want to ask you a few -- He was a wonderful doctor . So kind , so unselfish . The best of husbands . Who could 've wanted to kill him ? What exactly happened , Mrs . Christow ? It was all so sudden ... I went out from the house , and along the path to the swimming pool ... What time was this ? About 12:58 . I noticed the clock . No ... I do n't know . Sir Henry and Edward were out shooting . I just saw John ... blood and a revolver . - And I picked up the revolver ... - Why ? I beg your pardon ? Why did you pick it up ? I do n't know . Should n't I have ? So you have decided that Madame Christow shot her husband ? Yes , sir . Do n't you think she did it ? It could have happened as she said . Yes , could have . But it 's a very thin story . They all think she did it . And you thought she 'd done it , did n't you ? When you first arrived on the scene ... I am not sure what I thought . Something was not exactement as it should have been . What 's that ? Looks like leather work , sir . - Oh , right . - Sir , we got the weapon . Come on , pick it up . Yes , it comes from my collection . It 's my hobby , Inspector . - When did you last see this one ? - Yesterday afternoon . We were doing some target practice . Who actually fired the gun on that occasion ? I think we all had at least one shot with it . - Including Gerda Christow ? - Including Gerda Christow . And after the shooting ? I put the firearm back in its usual place . Will Sir Henry require a late supper , milady ? There is some duck leftover . No , Gudgeon , he 's driving Mrs . Christow up to London as we speak . He 's staying at his club . Gudgeon , about those eggs ... I meant to write the date on them , as per usual . But , because of the confusion ... Could you kindly ask the cook ? I 've seen to it myself , milady . Oh , bless you , Gudgeon . - Do you think Gerda will be alright ? - Oh , yes . I can just see them , scrabbling hockey types , from Turnbridge Wells . What extraodinary things you do say , Lucy ! Very well , Eastbourne and tennis , if you insist . I wonder if there 're any left ... ? - School friends ? - No ! Policemen . Do n't they normally leave one hovering in the hall ? Or outside , peeking behind a bush , watching the door ? In case another murder is comitted in the night ? Lucy , do n't ... I 'm so sorry , how stupid of me , of course . Gerda is on her way back to London . Oh , dear . I did n't mean ... Tomorrow , I think it 's better to telephone the shop , you know . Just tell them about the inquest . Just say you 're staying off here for a few days . I have n't said anything , but you do know how sorry I am ? Sorry ? That John Christow 's gone ? You did n't like John . Henrietta , for God 's sake ! No need to be like that . What did you think I 'd be like ? Did you think I 'd seat and cry for a pocket handkerchief while you 'd held my hand ? You 're nice enough , Edward , but , honestly , you are inadequate . Al . Yes . Monsieur Poirot , we could use your brains . Join us , would you ? So which of the ladies did this wrap belong to ? I take it , sir , that you 're referring to the cape of artic fox . I noticed it yesterday , when I took the cherry out to the pavillion . But it is not the property of anyone in this establishment , sir . Well , who 's is it , then ? It might possibly belong to Miss Cray , the motion picture actrice . She payed a visit after dinner , the night before last , for the purpose of borrowing some matches , sir . Which means that all Mrs . Christow had to do was to get it from the study . Do n't you agree ? - And her motive , what is it ? - Motive ? Jealousy , I 'd say . La jalousie ? Peut- ? tre . You know these fancy doctors . He 'd probably get one of those rich lady patients a good " see to " . And Lady Angkatell mentioned some trouble with a nurse . But she was a bit vague . Yes , she would be vague . I 'm taking the train off to London . I 'm going to Harley Street . Would you care to join me ? I do n't remember any quarrels . No . Mrs . Christow was devoted to her husband . Quite slavishly so . - Tyrannical , was he ? - No . But he was what I would call a selfish man . He took it for granted that Mrs . Christow would fall in with his ideas . Yes , but any hanky panky ? - Certainly not . What about Mlle . Veronica Cray ? Veronica Cray ? Well , we believe she was a friend of Dr . Christow's . - Do you mean the actrice ? - Oui . I 'd no idea he knew her . Any ideas as to whom might have killed Dr . Christow ? Absolutely none at all , Inspector . When the body was discovered , Mme . Christow was standing beside it , with a revolver in her hand . Look , I do n't know who you are , but if you think Gerda Christow killed her husband , you are categorically wrong . - It 's the Inspector , Mrs . Christow . - Thank you , Collie . - Good afternoon . - My friend Elsie , I mean , Mrs . Patterson . - Ma'am . This is Monsieur Poirot . Have you found out who killed him ? Uh ... no , not yet Ma'am . But perhaps Madame Christow would prefer to speak for herself . It was not me . No . It is a hard thing , to kill the one you love , n'est ce pas ? A very hard thing , I should imagine . I could n't do it . Balistic 's report . We ran it right away . Have a look at that , Poirot . Merci , Madame . So the balistics report proves that the gun in the pool was not the one who killed John Christow . I 've spoken to Sir Henry . He says that there is a gun missing in his collection . A .38 Smith Wesson , brown holster . I think this whole thing could be a frame set up to implicate Mrs . Christow . But , if that was so , why do not leave the right revolver lying by the body ? But she might not have pick it up . Well , he had a funny way to work about it . We suspected her right from the start . Oui , mon ami . Very swiftly you suspected her . Look , Poirot . You were a eye witness , you saw everything . Oui , I saw . But the eyes of witnesses are most unreliable . Sometimes , the eyes see what they are meant to see . You saying it was arranged ? There was something about the tableau , the people around the pool it was false . And I can not place my finger on what it was . There were three people , Lady Angkatell , Monsieur Edward Angkatell and Henrietta Savernake . Henrietta . And anyone of these three people could have shot Dr . Christow before Madame Christow arrived , could have retreated by one of the paths , turn around and returned . Blimey , you 're right . There is also another possibility , Inspector . Crime of passion . Bingo ! - You have interviewed her ? - Yes , I have . Christow went to visit her that morning . They had a fight . I spoke to the maid . Cray said to him : " I hate you more than I ever thought I could hate anyone ! " That is interesting . And it was her fur coat in the pavillion ? Yes , it was . She must have left it there when she entered to borrow the matches . I do not believe she went there to borrow the matches . She could have borrowed them from me and saved the walk . No , no , no . She was nervous , on account of you being a foreigner . Et bien ... - Sant ? . - Sant ? . You know something about human nature , do n't you ? I know a little about human nature . Inspector Grange has got into his head that I quarreled with John Christow on the day he died . But the real truth is so fantastic that I 'm certain that a guy like Grange would n't believe it . But I think you might understand . I am flattered , Mademoiselle . Actually , I am married . Madame . 12 years ago , John was very in love with me . Even obsessively so . He wanted me to give up acting , having a life of my own , even a mind of my own He was so possessive and domineering I thought I could n't go through with it and I broke off the engagement . I 'm affrai he took it rather hard . When we came back here , on saturday night , the whole thing blew up again . He went mad , quite literally mad . He wanted to leave his wife and children , he wanted me to divorce my husband he wanted us to get back together . He carried a torch for me , all these years . We argued and argued , and in the end I had to send him back The Hollow . He insisted . I told him I did n't love him , I could never love him and I begged him not to ruin my life a second time . I had to be brutal . Yes , I said I hated him . And we parted in anger . And now he is dead . - It is a tragedy . - Undoubtedly . Do you think I should say any of this at the inquest ? I mean ... his wife . I can not see that it has any bearing at the inquest . It is private . And perhaps it should remain so . I talked with the kitchen maid , sir . Simmons . She says that , Sunday afternoon , she saw the butler walk across the hall with a revolver in his hand . I 'm very sorry , sir . I suppose I ought to have mentioned it . At about 17:30 , I noticed a revolver lying upon the hall table . I picked it up and brought it in here . Which one , Gudgeon ? This one , sir . But that is not a revolver . That is an automatic pistol . I 'm very sorry , sir . I 'm afraid I 'm not fully informed about firearms . Sir Henry , I 'll have it fully checked for fingerprints . Oh ! ... I doubt there will be any fingerprints , sir . Why not ? Because I polished it with my handkerchief before replacing it , sir . Why the devil did you do that ? I felt it might be dusty , sir . How nice to see you , Monsieur Poirot . Oh , dear ! There 's a poor girl in the kichen , just sobbing her heart out . What have you been telling them about the pistol , Gudgeon ? Never mind , it does n't matter . I 'll explain everything . You may go . Dear poor Gudgeon , you know . He tries so hard to protect us from any kind of trouble ... No , no , no . He found it when he took out the eggs . Eggs ? What eggs ? You see , I went out to the farm to collect the eggs . I put the pistol on the egg basket and then I put the new eggs on top of the pistol . When I came back and saw John laying there , well ... I mean , unwell I sort of had a bit of a shock and almost dropped the basket . Dear sweet Gudgeon , as per usual , sprang to my rescue . Later on , I wanted to write the date on the eggs , otherwise , you see , we tend to eat the fresher eggs before the older one's , and that simply will not do ... And then Gudgeon told me he had taken care of everything . And which pistol was that , Lady Angkatell ? That was the Mauser.25 . And why did you put it into the basket ? Oh ! I knew you would ask me that , Monsieur Poirot . My wife is extremely absent-minded . Sir Henry , if I may ask you a question . How many people , in general , know that the police can identify a gun by the little marks on the bullet . The marks of the riffling . I think that 's pretty well common knowledge nowadays , Poirot . I was just taking the dog for a walk . I love peaking in other people 's houses . Do you mind if I take a look ? But certainly , Mademoiselle , entrez , if you please . I would be most grateful , however , if the dog might be kept outside . How beautifully tidy ! You 'd hate my studio . There 's clay all over the place , and glaze , and paint bottles ... But I understand , you are an artiste . I 've known crimes that were artistic , supreme exercises of imagination . But the solving of them , non . The criative power is not what is needed . What is required is a passion for truth . And , once you have the truth , once you have knowledge , is that enough ? Or do you have to go one step further and transform the knowledge into action ? Why did you come here , Mademoiselle Savernake ? As I said , I was taking the dog for a walk . It is odd I did never take notice of a dog on my visits to the Angkatell . That might be because they have n't got one . I borrowed the gardener 's . Do n't actually like animals much , dogs , horses ... horrible , smelly things . I am not , Monsieur Poirot , terribly truthful . Non . But I think that you have integrity . The inquest is tomorrow . I suppose not . Why should Gerda bear such heavy burden ? She adored John and now she is dead . I did n't break up his married life . I was one of a procession , along with Veronica Cray and all the others . - So he was like that ? - No ! He was a noble man , a fine man . He was doing a vital research into a debilitanting disease . It 's called Ridgeway 's , there is no known cure . He was working on it night and day , for months . His curiosity , his determination ... Oh ! I wish I could make you understand . - But I understand . - Really ? You mentioned Veronica Cray . She also was a friend of Dr . Christow ? They were engaged to be married 12 years ago . Were they ? Look , I 'll make it simple . Veronica was , and is , a bitch of the first water . He had a number of affairs , which Gerda never knew nothing about . But he really never got over Veronica . And in the last Saturday they met , for the first time in 12 years . He went out to see her home and he returned to the Hollow at 03:00 a.m .. Yes . How do you know ? The housemaid had a toothache . Lucy has far too many servants . And how is it that you know ? I was watching out my window . The toothache , Mademoiselle ? Quite another kind of ache , Monsieur Poirot . If you see me with a pistol in my hand , Simmons , the proper thing to do is come to me and say : Mr . Gudeon , would you be so kind and give me an explanation . Yes , Mr . Gudgeon . The improper thing to do is to go babbling to the Police . That is common . I do recall , though , waking up that morning with some sort of premonition , that there might , just might , be some kind of accident .. Accident , who might have had an accident ? Well , obviously , John Christow . And , I mean , one does feel awfully sorry , of course , and one does tend to blame oneself ... - Good God , Lucy ! Oh , Henry ! Oh , Henry ! Oh , Henry , I 'm so dreadfully worried about Ainswick . If Edward never marries , and he wo n't , you know , if Henrietta turns him down , it will all die out . It will . They will break it up and sell it off in little tiny pieces . Lucy , does it really , honestly , matter ? Of course it matters . Ainswick is my home . It 's all our land . No ... Somebody 'd got to get rid of him . Lucy , you did n't ... One does n't ask guests for the weekend and start bumping them off . - Did your aunt like John Christow ? - Lucy ? Lucy 's a cousin , not an aunt . Yes , she liked him very much . And your ... also cousin , Mr . Edward Angkatell , - did he like Dr . Christow ? - Not particularly . And do they like Madame Christow ? It 's not a matter of liking her , she 's fam ? ly . - Is she ? - We 're not all rich , you know ? Gerda is from a branch of rather humble Angkatell 's . She 's tolerated , I think it 's fair to say , because she 's one of us . And your understanding of tolerance would be to sleep with her husband ? Why did you take the revolver out of the hand of Madame Christow and drop it into the pool ? A Gerda is very clumsy . If there were fingerprints on that revolver , that is to say , fingerprints before Madame Christow handled it , it would 've been intersting to know who 's they were . Meaning that you think that they were mine . You 're suggesting that I shot John and then left the revolver beside him so that Gerda could come along and pick it up . But if I 'd done that , give me credit for enough intelligence , to have wiped my own figerprints off first . But , Mademoiselle , you have enough intelligence to know that if there would be no fingerprints in the revolver , other than Madame Christow 's , other than Madame Christow 's , it would be tr ? s remarcable . Because you were all shooting with the revolver the day before . And there are something else we have just discovered . We now know that the revover that was dropped into the pool was not the revolver that killed John Christow . " I told you , we were lovers . Oh yes , of course . He was your lover . So , as he was dying , he says , " Henrietta . " Very touching . - I do n't think there is any need to sneer . - I am not sneering . But I do not like being lied to . I 've admitted that I 'm not very truthful . But I do n't kill people , Monsieur Poirot . Gerda ! Poor dear , Gerda . I 'm so sorry . Not getting too a little sleep , I trust . What is an adjournment , you know ? You must be famished . Why do n't you come back to the Hollow for lunch ? I 'm taking Gerda directly home . She needs rest and quiet , not this . What did they see in Christow ? That wretched woman is completely heartbroken . - Poor devil . Bye . Edward ! - Damn cold ! - It is , rather . What 's this one ? It looks a bit like Gerda . Cowed and hunched . She modelled for me . Do n't you dare tell her that 's what what I ended up with . I call it " The Worshiper " . Who is she worshiping ? John . Did you understand all that business with the second gun ? No , but it lets Gerda off the hook , does n't it ? Let 's have some tea and toasts , then I 'll take you to your lodgings . Mademoiselle , do not ! John has been shot . He 's dead . Edward , Midge , how wonderful to see you both ! He rescued me from Madame Alfrege . It was frightfully romantic . I was whisked from the shop and taken to lunch at The Connaught and , do you know what ? I never went back . I 'm a dull dog , I know . I am no much good at anything . And nothing could make me happier . Of white satin , do n't you think ? And ivory Prayer Book . What about bridesmaids ? Oh , I do n't fuss . Just a quiet wedding . I quite agree . They do n't match , do they ? I mean it , there 's always a rather plain one , that ruins the whole -- Absolutely dozens of them , poking about in the woods , making a terrible mess with all the pheasants ! Why are they still here ? They 're searching for the missing revolver , Midge . Bonjour , Mademoiselle . Good morning , Monsieur Poirot . Will they find it , do you think ? Soon , I should say . You have returned very suddenly from London , Mademoiselle . There 's a party for Midge and Edward , who , believe it or not , are getting married . And it is to say that we are contending against a mind that is able of inventions that are intricate and ingenious . So that every time we seem to be heading towards the truth , we 're actually being led away from it . A mind that is subtle and yes , very ingenious , which is plotting agaist us the whole time . And succeding . What is that to do with me ? It is a creative mind , Mademoiselle . - And this is a strange tree . - It 's a Igdrasil . A memento of my childhood , I draw it everywhere , doodling , you know . I 've seen it before , in the pavillion , by the pool . In the pavillion ? Where it must have been drawn on Sunday morning . Oh yes , on the little table . - But that was on Saturday afternoon . - Non , non ... - Non , because Grange 's men did not leave the area until dusk . Oh , yes ! I remember . It was after dinner , on Saturday . Non , Mademoiselle Savernake . People do not doodle in the dark . No , I think you were in the pavillion on Sunday , after 12:00 , when Gudgeon brought out the cherry glasses . I think you stood by the table , watching someone , waiting for someone and you doodled . I did n't go down to the pool until 13:00 . Just after John Christow had been shot . But Igdrasil testifies against you . You were there and shot Dr . Christow or you were there and saw who did . This is outrageous ! Do you think you are cleverer than I ? The inquest resumes tomorrow , and all I 've got is vague suspicions leading to nowhere . Nowhere , instead of somewhere . That is it . Do you know , half the time I think those Angkatells know all about it . She went straight to Chelsea . I searched her studio with a fine tooth comb , but there 's no gun . Just art pieces . Sculptures , funny looking horses , bits of wood , metal ... - Horses , did you say ? - Wel , one horse . If you can call it a horse . - A horse ? - Yeah , what 's so fascinating about that ? It 's a point of psicology , Inspector . How quickly can you get me up to London ? What 're you looking for , sir ? This . The horse . Merci . Quite good , actually . Merci . Monsieur Poirot ! Mademoiselle Savernake does n't like horses . Voil ? . I think that this will prove to be the murder weapon . - So Miss Savernake did it . - Non ! Looks to me bloody likely . No , Mademoiselle Savernake is not , in my opinion , a murderer . If I might , the inquest is concluded , murder by person or persons unknown . Is it necessary to trouble Her Ladyship further , sir ? Lady Angkatell . Monsieur Poirot . Tell me , what are your views on compost ? I 've come to offer you apologies for the inconveniencies you have suffered . It 's high time to put a full stop to the whole thing . You do understand me , do n't you ? I 'm not sure that I do , Lady Angkatell . Oh , come , come , Poirot . You understand perfectly ! Since Inspector Grange has failed to find the murder weapon , he 'll have to let the whole thing drop . You , I dare say , wo n't . Non , I shall not let it drop . What if were told the truth ? Would you like to tell me the truth ? Oh , Monsieur Poirot , I would love to tell you the truth . Could we , Madame ? You really are very foreign , are n't you ? Are you quite sure you have not something , Lady Angkatell ? Something just came upon me , you might have overlooked it . I could be wrong , of course , and you could 've handled everything , but since you never mentioned it , I 'm a little concearned ... What 's the matter , Lucy ? - It 's the holster . - What ? Oh Henrietta , the holster ! The gun was in a holster ! - Yes , Collie ? - It 's Miss Savernake . The holster , Gerda ! Where is the holster ? You have to give me the holster and then you 'll be safe . Not completely safe . Dommage . Poirot ! How did you ... ? Sometimes , the fastest car it is not fast enough , Mademoiselle . Not when it races against the brain . Where are the children ? - Elsie 's taken them to the Zoo . - Thank Heaven for that ! I did . Why did you do it , Gerda ? Why did you kill John ? Because it was all a lie ! Everything ! I thought he was the noblest man in the world . But I saw his face when he followed that woman , that evening ... I knew he 'd loved her , before he 'd married me , but I thought ... I thought it was over . I tried to sleep , but I could n't . It was the middle of the night . I had to know . They were there . I could hear them . John and Veronica Cray . I believed in him as though he were God . I worshiped him . And it was all a lie . I had to kill him . You do see that ? I had to ! I am not quite so stupid as everyone thinks . I knew I could kill John and the Police would never know because I had read in this novel how they can tell which gun fires the bullet . It was easy . You shove the cilinder back into the frame and you 're ready for shooting . I 'd shot with one then hide it and let them find me holding the other . I forgot about the leather thing . - The holster . - I forgot about it too . I also forgot . The memory , it is selective , n'est ce pas ? And then I heard Inspector Grange mention this holster , this holster of leather -- I remembered where I had seen it before . What 's that ? Looks like leather work , sir . Where is your bag for the leather work ? I-I think it 's in the surgery . The surgery ? I seat there . In his chair . I 'll fetch it for you , shall I ? S'il vous pla ? t . But Madame ... Oh , I 'm not going anywhere , do n't worry . It could have worked , Mademoiselle , if you did not tell me how much you detested the creatures . I know that you were helped by your family , once they knew what you wanted done . Henrietta . Is n't it possible that Gerda came along by the pool , found John lying there and just picked up the revolver when we came on the scene ? This is what Gerda says ? Yes . But why do you wanted it done , Mademoiselle ? Because John asked me to . That 's what he meant when he said , " Henrietta " . He was asking me to protect Gerda . And he knew that I 'd do anything he wanted , because I loved him . Oui . I began to realize the truth when I saw there was a pattern , a pattern to implicate everyone , other than Gerda Christow . You deliberatly planted Igdrasil to catch my attention and put yourself under suspicion . Because I polished it with my handkerchief before replacing it , sir . And Lady Angkatell , and the family , they closed hands and colluded , because ... There 's only one thing to do , if you want to clear from suspicion the person who is actually guilty , suggest guilt elsewhere , but never localize it . - Vite ! - Oh , my God ! Gerda ! Gerda ! Help her , for God 's sake ! It is too late . Potassium Cyanide . Wife of a doctor ... She knew exactly what to do . What happens to me now ? Go , my child . Your place is with the living . I will remain here with the dead . 
@@5219541 Hello , I 'm Leonard Maltin ... and I 'm happy to be sitting here at Fess Parker 's ... beautiful winery in Los Olivos , California ... with our host , our winemaker , and our star , Fess Parker . Thanks for letting us come and visit you today . It 's a pleasure , Leonard ... and it 's always great to see you . Thank you . I 've just been watching , again ... the Davy Crockett shows ... as they first appeared on the air ... and it 's taken me back a long time ... and I wonder if you have a specific recollection ... of the first time you met Walt Disney ... and heard about this idea . I certainly do . When Walt Disney saw a bit from the movie " Them " ... and that led to a series of meetings ... with Bill Walsh , who later produced the shows ... and Tom Blackburn who wrote the screenplays . And after I 'd been out a couple of times ... I was asked to come again , and they said ..... he came in and said , " Why do n't you come with me ? " We walked down the hall till there was a desk and 2 chairs . I was carrying my little guitar . He said , " Where are you from and what have you been doing ? " He made me feel comfortable right off . He was not threatening . I felt very comfortable ... and finally he said , " I see you brought your guitar " . I said , " Yeah . I write a little song or two " . And he said , " Well , play me one " . So , I did , and he said , " OK , thank you " . And we parted and a few days later ... they said , " Come back . " We 're going to do the thing with you " . Did you realize the importance of that statement ... of that commitment at that moment ? No , not really . So , Walt Disney was ... that was a magic place ... and I 'd been at all the studios . I 'd been a freelance actor for about three years ... so I was familiar ... but there was something about the Disney studio ... that was very special . It was collegiate . Mm-hmm . And calm and peaceful ... and the people were more like family ... than any place I 'd been . And I do n't imagine as a working actor ... you necessarily met the boss at every studio you went to . No . Mr . Mayer managed to avoid me ... and so did Jack Warner . Did you feel or see Walt 's hand at work ... as the shows were being prepared ... or was it the people on the front line ... who were actually getting the job done ? I think Walt was very , very much involved ... although I did n't realize it at the time . First of all , if I could just tell you ... that the company ..... independent cameramen and directors ... and so forth from the industry . So they all came together ... and Walt Disney sent us as far away from the studio ... as you could get ... Cherokee , North Carolina . There was one telephone in Cherokee ... a motel and a filling station , and that was it . And we were there for two or three weeks . It was n't long until it was apparent ... that we were running over schedule . But he liked what he was seeing ... and then he visited us one day . Pat Hogan , who played Redstick the Indian ... had just been beating me up all day . And Walt and Lily showed up with some friends of theirs ... and I think from that moment on ... we felt pretty good ... that he 'd come to see what we were doing . Do you remember getting any instructions ... about how to play Davy ? There was a script which indicated a lot ... but did you have any kind of coaching ..... or did you sort of feel your own way ? Actually , I had quite a conflict ... with the director . We became friends ultimately ... but for a few weeks , it was really difficult ... because he was a stage-trained actor ... turned director . Norman Foster . My background was just the few films that I 'd been in ... and I tended to be sort of low-key . And he did n't think that I was coming across ... so he was constantly complaining and pushing me ... and maybe it worked . Sometimes you have to get people a little irritated ... to get enough energy ... so I 've never known where the equity was there ... but between us , it worked out ... and years later we became friends . But for a long time we were n't comfortable . The location filming adds so much to these shows . First , that they look beautiful ... but obviously , there 's an authenticity ... you 're not gon na get on the back lot . We traveled from Cherokee , North Carolina ... into Tennessee . There was a beautiful river there ... and that 's where we did the bear wrestling scene . You sure spoiled things good . Now I got ta do it the old-fashioned way . Yee-hoo ! Give him what fer , Davy ! Then we moved on to Nashville ... to Percy Warner Park ... which is a huge park right in the middle of Nashville . And it was just as natural ... as if we 'd been 40 miles south ... so we shot a lot of the film there ... but I think the high point was Andrew Jackson 's home ... the Hermitage , was available for us ... and we were able to shoot there on the grounds ... and then stop at the door ... and then there was a banker who lived in Nashville ... who had done a replica of the Hermitage ... and he allowed us to come inside ... so we had it both ways ... became really very involved ... particularly the community actors ... who played the legislators and the business people . We really did have some very talented people ... that I think television was just discovering . You and Buddy Ebsen just seemed like a perfect fit . We did hit it off ... and in so many instances , Buddy was teaching me things . For example , they brought up two horses ... for us to ride in one of the episodes . One was black and one was white . So I said , " Buddy , which one do you want ? " And he said , " I 'll take the white one " . So we had that little friendly rivalry ... going on right from the beginning . I 'm thinking about other good people ... like William Bakewell . Oh , Billy Bakewell became a lifelong friend . He touched my life in many ways ... and not the least of which was introducing me ... to the Motion Picture Country Home ... and sponsored me to be a member ..... I did n't have time , so I had to resign . Now , Kenneth Tobey has a funny situation . He 's in both series of " Crockett " ... in quite different parts . I guess they thought kids would n't notice , huh ? I do n't think they did . I think he got away with it . He was a great Bowie ... and Jocko was just one of my favorite characters . - What 's your name ? - Jocko . Mine 's Georgie . Well , I 'm pleased to meet you . Ahh ! Kinda tasty , ai n't it ? ... pink whiskers ... That 'd grow pink whiskers on a hound dog . Also , Basil Ruysdael . There 's another veteran . People ... no one today would know Basil Ruysdael . He was a light opera performer ... he sang and was a great character actor . Enjoying yourself , Davy ? That was a mighty fine supper , Mr . President ... and got her fresh painted ... folks are calling her the White House . Yeah . Sounds better at that . Yeah , that 's what she 'll be from now on . And I remember when we got close to the scene ... where Davy Crockett goes in ... and makes his speech before Congress ... he casually asked me on the set one day ... " Are you ready to do that scene that 's coming up ? " I said , " Well , I think so " . He said , " Would you like to run the lines with me a little bit ? " And I said , " Sure . I 'd love to " . Basil introduced me to some concepts ... of how to do that scene that frankly ... I had n't the experience nor had I recognized . So he was a great help ... and we continued our friendship ... until he passed away . All right , now let 's talk about Jeff York . He is so wonderful as Mike Fink ... and all those films ... that we had a lot of fun doing . Well , you know , Jeff was an interesting person . Ha ha ! Ai n't he forgive me yet ? Nope . But he 'll get over it . Well , lucky just his feelings got hurt . You know , Davy , you showed rare good sense ... in getting old Mike Fink to help you . So , he was a character playing a character ? Girls run and hide Brave men shiver I 'm Mike Fink King of the river I do n't know if you call it typecasting or not ... but again , Mike Mazurki just seems the perfect choice ... for that character . Mike introduced me to the concept ... that I could be a rag doll . We had no stunt doubles . When we had to do our fight . We had to make it up and all that . And Mike and I were wrestling and fighting ... and he would just pick me up and throw me ..... into a split rail fence ... which we had decided would be nice ... if I knocked the rail down . And so the first time he threw me into it ... I had no padding ... and the rail was much stronger than we anticipated ... and it really hurt . So we took the blanket off the camera ... and stuffed it in the back of my pants ... and we did it again and it worked . He spent many years as an actor ... but many years as a wrestler as well . Absolutely . And I have great respect for his physical prowess . It was n't until we got to " The River Pirates " ... that someone thought about ... having some stunt doubles there . But by that time , we were accustomed ... to doing most of the things ourself . Well , do you remember your first inkling ... that Davy was becoming a phenomenon ? Unlike some of the other phenomenons that followed ..... or vice versa . And everybody in-between . Briefly . How quickly did they put you on a regimen ... of making personal appearances as Davy Crockett ? My first stop was Oklahoma City . And this is the way it went . I got dressed in the restroom ... on a small commercial airplane ... went down the stairs , there was a limousine ... and six motorcycle policemen ... and we went as fast as you can go ... to a horse show in progress . Got out of the limousine ... I had my rifle and my hat and my costume on ... and they said , " Here 's your horse " . And I said , " What 'll I do ? " They said , " Go in , ride around the arena ... " wave to the kids ... " come out to the middle , sing Davy Crockett ... " and anything else you 'd like to do " . Then that 's the way we started . Wow . But I basically did n't mind doing the P.R ... for the studio . Walt had given me 10% ... of the Davy Crockett merchandising . That is , the Walt Disney Davy Crockett merchandise . So I enjoyed doing those personal appearances ... and going to Hudson 's Department Store in Detroit ... and Pizitz in Birmingham . It was a great adventure . I enjoyed it . And then you were at opening day of Disneyland ... which was another , I 'm sure , memorable day . Yes . In my wildest dreams ... I did n't expect to sing and dance on live television ... but we did . Such as it was . I was ridin'through the woods To trade off skins for boughten goods 40 arrows hit a tree I knew the Sioux were out for me I had the great pleasure of riding with Walt ... in the first parade ... and then going over to the fire station ... and having a little libation ... and sliding down the fire pole ... in the crowd ... and looking and seeing what he had put together . And then his first speech . I always thought he made great speeches . He had a knack of communicating ... verbally , personality-wise . He was a good salesman . - He was a great communicator . - He was . What was the best thing ... about being part of that Walt Disney family ? I 've had the friendship and the interest ... of so many people and in such a broad way ... because Disney is not ... just a popular product in America ... it 's a popular product in the world . And so to be a part of something of that nature ... and to share that with the individuals ... that created it ... I often feel , you know ... that I 'm being congratulated for Bill Walsh and Bakewell ... and Walt and all the people . And it 's been a wonderful experience . I 've seen no negative . The only thing I 'm looking forward to ... Yes . Fess , I want to thank you ... for letting us visit your beautiful winery ... and for sharing all those wonderful memories . Cheers to you . It 's a pleasure on behalf of the Fess Parker family . And I 'd like to invite you ... into the little village of Los Olivos ... here in Santa Barbara County for lunch . I think I will agree . Thank you very much . OK . Beautiful .

@@5220641 The rain has stopped , Your Majesty . We should be able to continue with the portrait . So I should hope , Albert . First time we 've had the whole family here for six years . Let 's try and get one in . We 'll need both banks to fill light . I 've already strung the cables , sir . - All set up , sir . - Thank you . We 're ready now , everybody . Please remember to look straight into the lens and keep your eyes wide and bright . Now , after three . One , two ... three . I know , at a time like this , it 's difficult to apply oneself to any task . But a surviving heir to the throne must be found . The nation , the Commonwealth , and I dare say the known world await your findings . Good luck , gentlemen . Since when do we give a toss about this kind of bullshit ? Shut up , Dysentery . Where 's your sense of national flippin ' pride ? - Excuse me , Sir Cedric . Who is it ? His name is Jones . Ralph Jones . Ralph Jones . Is he everything we might have hoped ? Well , he has his strengths and his weaknesses . You see ... he 's an American . Quickly . The strengths ? And here 's one from the great Don Ho , the godfather of Hawaiian soul . # Tiny bubbles # In the wine # Make me happy # Oh , how they make me feel fine And he 's in there ! # Tiny bubbles # Make me warm all over Are you shittin ' me ? # With the feelin ' that I 'm gon na love you # Till the end of time Thank you . - Brady , I got that 20 for you tomorrow . - Yeah , right ! Hey , Mitzi . Your show went a little better than mine . Hey , Ed , what are you doin ' down here ? I 've had it with you , Jones . What did I do now ? Couple cheques bounce ? No , he 's here for your protection . Hey , Jones , get over here . I 'm not finished talkin ' to you . Come on in . I 'll sign a picture for ya . Smashing show , by the way . Smashing . - We 're not renewing you after this week . - What ? ! I 'm puttin ' Mitzi in your slot . You little backstabbing ' bitch . - Just turn in your tux , Jones . - What ? Cos I would n't sing ' The Impossible Dream ' ? Vacate your room by noon or we 'll throw your stuff out . Shit . Can you believe that ? It 's beyond all comprehension , Your Majesty . But I have news that might bring you cheer . I doubt it . It is my glorious duty to inform you ... that you are the new ... King of England . You see , the late king 's uncle , the Duke of Warren ... One Gastro Death-Dealer with onions , jalape���o ? os and Tabasco . Thank you . At any rate , Constance had a son , your father . Now , since he and your grandmother are both dead ... you are the only surviving royal heir in your line . Look , even if I believed ya , which I do n't ... I have n't got time to be the King of England . I got ta get a job . This is more than a job . I may put a band together , get back to playing rock and roll . But you ca n't refuse the throne . It 's a sacred trust . - Yeah ? What does a sacred trust pay ? - You do n't get a salary , as such . - As I figured . I pay you , right ? - You do n't need money . Everything 's taken care of . The king has his own castle , five castles , in fact ... You 're good , Dunc . Real good . - Do you remember your grandmother ? - Connie ? Yeah . Remember a ring she wore ? Sure , she 'd brag about it all the time . She said she got it from some prince ... There 's only one other like it ... the Duke of Warren 's . Was this the ring ? Holy shit . Yes ! Yes ! How long do you need me ? I 've never held a job for more than six months . Well , you see , a king is a king for life . No problem . My schedule 's pretty open . # God save the king # God save the king # Rule Britannia # God save the king There it is , Your Majesty . Your new home . - Which room 's mine ? - Um ... all of them . # God save the king # God save the king Excuse me , Sir Cedric . His Majesty is here ... King of Great Britain , Northern Ireland and all her other realms and territories ... Head of the Commonwealth , Defender of the Faith . How you doin ' ? How do you do , Your Majesty ? - I 'm Cedric Willingham . - Glad to meet ya , Ced . Have you ever been to England before ? No . But I have almost all the Rolling Stones albums . Well , then , you 're practically a native . Dunc says you 've been here 25 years . You must be a hell of a typist by now . I 'm not that type of secretary . My duty is to instruct you in the arts of sovereignty , to make you a king . Uh , look , my ' duties ' are mostly for show , right ? I hope you 're not countin ' on me to solve problems ... because I do n't have a lot of experience . English law prohibits monarchs from solving problems . Unfortunately , it does n't prohibit you from creating them . Good ! You might be thinking what name you 'd like to use as king . ' Edward ' and ' George ' have been popular this century . - What 's wrong with ' Ralph ' ? - It lacks a certain ... majesty . I ca n't really think of any notable Ralphs . Well , sure ... Ralph Macchio . Ralph Lauren . Ralph Kramden . Oh , this is extremely nice . Better than I 'm used to . This is the picture gallery . Many of the people in the paintings are your relatives . That 's the Duke of Warren , your unfortunate grandfather . You have his chin . That 's George III . You may remember him . He was king during that little temper tantrum you call the Revolutionary War . Sounds like sour grapes to me , Ced . After all , we did kick your ass . The loss is entirely yours , or rather theirs . Try to remember you 're an Englishman now . Fine . When she failed to give him a son , Henry VIII had Anne Boleyn ... ? - Look into adoption ? - Beheaded . Jeez , this is a tough country . Would this be to your liking , Your Majesty ? You know , I kinda like that . That 's an upholstery fabric , Your Majesty . English people do n't generally like their monarch to look like a sofa . Ah . These are traditional English dishes , some of which you will be served tonight . Here we have roast beef and Yorkshire pudding ... bangers and mash and the ever-popular spotted dick . Spotted dick ? ! - Dick of what ? - These are the bangers . Sausages . The spotted dick is a dessert . Could I just have some ice cream ? Quite an eventful first day , Your Majesty . I 'll leave you to rest now . This is Your Majesty 's bedroom . There you go , chief . Through those doors is your dining room , and across the way , the bath . Through here is your study ... and there is your dressing room . Anything we 've left out ? I do n't know . How about a bowling alley ? One other thing . At your coronation four months hence ... you will be required to wear the imperial state crown . It 's usually kept in the Tower of London , but we placed it near your bed ... as a reminder of the eminence of your office . It contains the Star of India , the second largest diamond in the world . You should practise wearing it to get used to the weight . - Good evening , Your Majesty . - Thanks . - Hey , Ced . - Yes ? What exactly is it that a king does all day ? Scarcely a minute is unaccounted for . Nevertheless , what you do is not as important as what you are . An embodiment of our history , our culture , our morality , our pride of achievement . In short , our ideal of civilisation . You must , under harsh public scrutiny ... exhibit all of our virtues and none of our shortcomings . Wait a minute . I thought all I was supposed to do was dress up and wave . - I do n't even know what our virtues are . - You will learn soon enough . I 'm afraid it 's a god 's burden to bear . Unfortunately , it must be borne by a man . Good evening , Your Majesty . It 's not enough simply to be the king . You must look and act like one . We 'll begin with the walk . Imagine yourself to be the master of your domain . A leader of men . Do n't swing your arms . Back straight . Head up . But relaxed . And please try to keep in mind that Jones will need a certain period of adjustment . He 's American . He 's impervious to adjustment . Better to declare his line at an end than subject England to this embarrassment . Are you suggesting that we have no king at all ? Certainly not . Simply choose a king from the House of Stuart ... who reigned in glory before the Wyndhams . Make theirs a royal line again . That would be your line , Lord Graves , making you next in line for the throne . Yes , I believe it would . Removing Jones would be a drastic measure for us to take at this juncture . After all , he does have royal blood , no matter how badly diluted . So until he commits some grievous error , we will simply have to live with him . Well ... yes . I suppose so . Well , Jones , you really fell upstairs this time . Yeah , Gordon . Could you bring me something ? - Anything . - Anything , Your Majesty ? I 've never had anybody bring me something . I wan na try it out . Certainly . Perhaps an assortment of fine chocolates ? Got any Milk Duds ? Sir Cedric , the king 's gone ! He just walked out . - Why did n't anyone stop him ? - We tried , sir , but he is the king . - McGuire 's with him . - We 've got to find him before the press . Think ! You 've been made King of England . Where 's the first place you would go ? Our headliner , Miss Fanny Oakley . Thank you , Fanny ! And now a young lady making her professional debut ... straight from Las Vegas , Nevada ... Miss Flamingo Mirage ! Yes , sir . Brewer Street , Soho . I will , sir . I 'm sorry ... Hey , Flamingo . Hi . Really unique show . Striptease without the nudity . My name 's Miranda . And the show was terrible . - Who are you ? - Ralph Jones . You know ... - you do n't really have a Vegas accent . - I would n't know . I 've never been there . How embarrassing ! Why did I ever think I could do this ? You just got ta remember to take a crossover step before your spinback ... or you 'll never make it around for the hip reveal . - A lot of girls have trouble first night . - This is my only night . They already sacked me . Know anybody who 'd wan na buy a tearaway dress ? - How about one of the maids ? - Your Majesty ... we should stay with the present uniform . Phippsy , you old hound ! I did n't know you went for this sort of thing . Meet Miranda . - Do you guys work here ? - Well , no . - I 'm the new king here . - The king of what ? Burlesque ? No ! England . That is n't a proper thing to joke about . I 'm not jokin ' . They just hired me . I could get you your job back . - I do n't think ... - I do n't want it back . I just wan na get dressed . Excuse me , please . This 'll only take a minute . I 'm new here . I do n't know many people . I thought we 'd get together tomorrow , have a drink ... - discuss the mood of the country ... - Alan ! - Who 's Alan ? - The bouncer . This is ridiculous . Nobody believes me . Maybe we should get some cards printed . - Alan ! - Look , I 'll make you a deal . If I can prove to you by tomorrow night I 'm the King of England , go out with me . Do n't you be touchin ' him now , lad . - Have we got a deal ? - Yes , all right , fine . Coming here is the best thing I 've done so far . Hiya , Ced . I need hardly remind you that this is not the preferred entertainment of royalty . Sorry , Ced . That 's it , Your Majesty . Grip the bat . Swing it vertically , not horizontally . In baseball the ball comes to you on the fly . In cricket it usually hits the ground . The bowler is trying to hit your stump . If he does , you are out . So the better shot to learn initially is the forward defensive shot . Bowler ? At first , Your Majesty , just try to block it . Bowler ... Pitch a few up , bowler . Nice and slow . It 's outta here ! Although there 's relief in most quarters that a new sovereign has been found ... doubts remain as to whether the American born king ..... the king 's life thus far has been relatively free of achievement : His mother is currently serving a two-year prison term ... - Miranda Greene ? - Yes . I 'm Lord Percival Graves . Do you have a moment ? It is a matter of some urgency . Do come in . I understand you 've met our new king . Yeah . Looks like I did . And you made quite an impression on him . - Who said that ? - Have you seen today 's Bugle ? 72 per cent of the people see the ascendancy to the throne of England ... by an American commoner as a serious threat to the status of the monarchy . I 'm sorry . What 's this got to do with me ? You are in a unique position to be of service to your country . I 'm sure that you are aware that members of the royal family ... are expected to maintain certain standards ... particularly with regard to the company they keep ... then the pressure on him to abdicate would be considerable . - You 're asking me to sleep with him ? - Oh , no , no , no . No , nothing like that . I simply want you to spend time with him . To befriend him , nurture his burgeoning affection ... until such time as a simple photograph can be taken . Little snapshot of you together in public . Forget it . He is making a mockery of centuries of tradition . We are on the brink of a national crisis . I think we 'll survive . What 's in this for you ? I 'm prepared to make it well worth your while . Thanks , but I do n't need the money . What about your family ? What about them ? Your father and brother have been out of work for almost a year , have n't they ? Such a tragedy , the demise of the steel industry ! My enquiries tell me that their savings have dried up . Debts are mounting . I do n't think you understand quite how much I 'm offering . Close the door . ? 15,000 to start . And if you 're successful , enough to ensure ... that you never have to worry about money for the rest of your life . You or your family . Now , surely , you 're not prepared to sacrifice their future ... for the sake of an American usurper that you do n't even know ? I think not . Tea ? Milk ? Sugar ? One lump or two ? Two for me . A little bonus there . So ... What 's on the agenda today ? One word of advice , Your Majesty . When you meet the Prime Minister ... it would be best to say ' How do you do ? ' rather than ' How you doin ' ? ' No problem . How do you do ? Excuse me . I did n't get much sleep last night . Still on Vegas time , plus I have n't had a day job for four years . Your Majesty , may I present the Prime Minister , Geoffrey Hale ? How do you do , Geoff ? - It 's a pleasure to meet Your Majesty . - Think nothing of it . Call me Ralph . No , I 'm afraid I ca n't . Shall we sit ? I do n't want to keep you , Your Majesty ... but there is a matter of some pressing national interest . - Fire away , Geoff . - As you may know ... there 's considerable unrest in Africa ... resulting in the emergence of several new states . Ah . Well , the first thing we 're gon na have to do is buy all-new globes . Beyond that , we should n't rush into anything . There 's no problem that ca n't be ignored if we put our minds to it . Yes , well , of these new states ... Zambezi is the most important , owing to its recently discovered mineral wealth . That 's pretty much my feeling . - I did n't know Zambezi even had a king . - They did n't until recently . Mulambon is anxious to legitimise himself ... by rubbing elbows with the royal houses of Europe . So , Your Majesty , we would be grateful if you would host a reception for ... him ... You 'll have to excuse him , Prime Minister . He is more of a night owl . Extraordinary fellow . Could I have a word , Willingham ? He simply wo n't do . He 's common , ignorant and extremely ill-mannered . The man 's an orangutan . God help us with the King of Zambezi . # Well , be-bop a-lula # She 's my baby # Be-bop a-lula # I do n't mean maybe - Your Majesty ? - Yes ? - Did you have a nice nap ? - I guess the jet lag caught up with me . - I 'm ready to go now , though . - Good . There 's much to cover ... and a primer on etiquette . What 's this ? Date night . Where does the king eat in this town ? I 'm in the mood for sushi . That 's out of the question . We have n't arranged security . Japanese are dangerous here ? Your Majesty , there are elements at large who might seek to do the king harm ... - ... for their own personal ends . - What kinda harm ? Well , kidnapping you for ransom . In some cases , even ... Even what ? Killin ' me ? You know , Ced , I ca n't take too many more surprises . Where was this when Phipps was goin ' on about the castles ? We did n't want to alarm you . There 's nothing to fear if precautions are taken . You must accept some limitations on your personal freedom , and on your wardrobe . So far , there are no royal luaus planned . There 's still got ta be a way to get this date in ... Your Maj . I 've got the king 's special permission . Go through . Miss Greene , Your Majesty . - Your Majesty . - You do n't have to worry about that . - And please , call me Ralph . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I could never do that . Yeah , God knows what could happen ! Well , I guess just the seven of us . That was a lovely dinner . I ca n't believe I 'm eating in the throne room . Yeah , well , Willingham wanted it to be intimate . I asked Gordon to get us some music , something we can dance to . Oh , here 's dessert . Would you care for some spotted ... Dick ? Yeah . I came to London to study design . I only tried exotic dancing because I needed some extra money . I went to night school for a bit . But when my dad lost his job , I started sending money home . Sure you will . Something 'll break for ya . I 've never done anything my whole life and look where I am . There . - What 's this ? - What 's what ? - There 's no such word as ' yo ' . - Are you crazy ? I use it all the time . You do n't have to look it up . We 're using the King 's English . If I say it , it 's a word . By the way , the Y 's on a triple-word score . I 'm starting to catch up here . Narrowed the gap to 164 points . What ? I do n't know . You 're not the kind of girl I 'm used to . You can spell , you wear clothes to work . You just have more class , I guess . I 'm just a sales girl from South London . There are things about me you might not like . Like what ? You 're beautiful , you 're smart , you 're honest . I should go . - Thank you for a lovely evening . - Thank you . I 'm sorry it took such a long time , Your Majesty , but I found you some music . I hope you are n't enamoured of her . - It would never work out . - Why not ? As king , you are expected to marry a woman of noble birth ... particularly given your less-than-perfect breeding . And Miss Greene , fetching as she may be , does not qualify . Your Majesty may remember , in 1936 ... King Edward fell in love with a commoner and had to abdicate his throne . The House of Wyndham can ill afford another such disaster . I did n't say I 'd marry her . I just wan na take her out ... if you did not see Miss Greene at all . But if you insist , it 's imperative that you only see her here at the palace . I 'll teach you a poem to help you remember the order of the kings . One , two , three Eds , Richard two , Henry four , five , six , then who ? Edward four , five , Rich the bad , then Richard III ... Then Henrys twice and Ed the Lad . Mary , Lizzie , James the vain , Charlie , Charlie , James again ... She 's already seen him twice this week . We could tip off the press next time . Have some photographers outside . No , let 's wait a bit longer . Give him enough time to become hopelessly infatuated with her . Pull ! Now this is what I call a room . Your Majesty , the Sovereign King Mulambon of Zambezi . Welcome , Your Majesty , on behalf of the people of the United Kingdom ... And the Commonwealth ... to have you as our guest . We hope you had a pleasant trip . Oh , look ! See the swan ? Keep those knees tight in . Sit back . Grip with the knees . Heels down ! Heels down ! Whoa ! Your Majesty . Oh , blast ! Hello , newsdesk ? I have something you might be interested in . When in public , a royal personage must refrain ... " from chewing gum , using profanity ... " picking his nose , scratching his private parts ... and staring dawn the bust lines of female dignitaries . What ? That 's everything . Good morning , Your Majesty . I 'm afraid I have some distressing news . Miss Greene 's presence last night did not go unnoticed . Your Majesty , for the sake of the monarchy , this gives you little choice ... but to end your friendship with Miss Greene . What ? ! I ca n't do that . I do n't even wan na do that . Do n't worry . I 've always liked my standards down where they are . Welcome , Your Majesty , on behalf of the people of the United Kingdom . It 's our pleasure to have you as our guest . Welcome , Your Majesty , on behalf of the people ... You got a good thing goin ' here . Do n't blow it . Do n't worry , Your Majesty . You 'll be fine . Your Majesty , may I present His Royal Highness King Mulambon of Zambezi . Hey , homes ! What 's happenin ' ? Gim me a quintet , brother ! I do not comprehend , Your Majesty . Welcome , Your Majesty , on behalf of the people of the United Kingdom ... You wan na go get a beer ? Do you feel that being the king of a major nation is tougher than you thought ? Yes , it is difficult sometimes , with all the ceremonial duties and official obligations . But I 'm quite pleased with the economic progress my country has made . The Rolls does n't have much poop . - This car gon na have fuel injection ? - Everything . Five-speed transmission ... - Reclining buckets ? Rear spoiler ? - No , but it 'll get excellent gas mileage . Gas mileage is fine , but keep in mind the first question any car-buyer asks : ' Will this get me laid ? ' Beautifully stated . Ah ! Looks like that 's all she wrote . Wan na go again ? Yes . Hi-ya ! - What was that , a five ? - No , it was a three . - Not on the line ? - Makes no difference . - I plan to claim victory with this throw . - Be careful not to foot-fault there . If he gets anything better than a seven here , we 're screwed . - You 're good . Can I get a set of those ? - I 'll send you one . Listen , I 've been meaning to ask you . I am the king . Damn . I knew I was gettin ' hosed over here . Well , I think he did pretty well , considering . It could have been worse . Yes , he could have exposed himself , I suppose . Yes ? The Prime Minister for you , sir . Good afternoon , Prime Minister . Yes . Oh , really ? Well , it 's a strange world we live in , is n't it , sir ? Yes , thank you . Goodbye . The Prime Minister spoke to King Mulambon . The king said he could n't remember when he 'd had so much fun . - Sherry ? - Please , yes . King Ralph seems to have passed his first diplomatic test with high marks . The king 's personal style , which had raised some eyebrows in official circles ... is now being characterised as " a breath of fresh air " . Congratulations , Your Majesty . We were a little nervous when we first decided to take a chance on you ... but , erm ... Today 's ' breath of fresh air ' can quickly become tomorrow 's ' ill wind ' . Now the Zambezi thing 's over with , I got a couple weeks of vacation coming , right ? If anything we will have to increase public appearances in light of your popularity . And the ball season will soon be upon us . You will need dance lessons . Waltz , foxtrot , even eightsome reel . Come on , I have n't had a day off since I 've been here . I ca n't go out , I eat alone , I live in a museum , I sleep in an auditorium ... - You will get used to it . - I got no family , no sex life . Good . Less chance for scandal . I do n't see anybody that does n't work for me . I 'm gettin ' palace fever . Are you trying to tell me in your uniquely American way that you are lonely ? Yeah . Good evening . Right , I 'm gon na give you guys one more chance . Fetch ! Sir Guy Cracknell ... Knight of the British Empire . Ooh , I 'm sorry . Are you all right ? I got him . I got him good . I 'm sorry . Really , I 'm terribly sorry . I got ta get outta here . Your evening cocoa , Your Majesty . - You have n't seen this , Gordon . - Have n't seen what , Your Majesty ? - I really need a night out , Gordon . - There are easier ways . Stay , boy . Stay . Hello ? Congratulations , my dear . The king has broken out of the palace ... and is at this very moment on his way to see you . When he calls , meet him wherever he chooses . There will be a photographer following you . Make sure that he gets what he needs . Good luck . Oh , yeah ! Hello , Miranda ? It 's me , Ralph . - Are you alone ? - Yeah . There 's somethin ' I wan na do . Two double Whoppers with fries and two giant Cokes . Two double Whoppers , two fries , two giants ! - Got any money ? I have n't been paid . - Sure . You know , you look familiar . Are n't you ... ? Yeah , you are , are n't you ? You 're the new king ! What , are you crazy ? What would I be doin ' in here ? It 's the king ! Could I have the burgers , please ? - Oh , look ! It 's the king ! - No , you got the wrong guy . I ai n't him . I ca n't ... All right , all right , one or two . Your Majesty , here 's a burger on the house . - I think I 'm gon na need a new burger . - Over here , Your Majesty . Maybe just one quick one . Very nice . - What the hell did you do that for ? - We 've got to go . - The fries are n't ready . - There 'll be photographers everywhere . - How about some onion rings ? - Your Majesty , I 've got your burger . - You should get back to the palace now . - I do n't wan na get back to the palace . - There 's got ta be some place we can go-- Well , maybe one . Two , three , four , side ... Two , three , four , forward ... Two , three , four , side ... Hope you 're not too upset about this ' mystery woman ' thing . The girls at work said it was probably some East End tart ... trying to get her picture in the papers . I wish we could meet again , somewhere else , in different circumstances . What ? What is it , this ' commoner ' thing ? Edward VIII and that Wallis broad ? That was 50 years ago . This is the ' 90s . We got ta be able to work somethin ' out . Anything 's possible . Not in England . Not for royalty . Do n't say that . I ca n't see myself making it here without you , Miranda . Now , this is exceptional . You realise , do n't you , that you 're looking at the fall of the House of Wyndham ? And before long , the House of Stuart will be restored to its rightful place . And you , Gordon , will be private secretary to the king . - Thank you . - Excuse me , my Lord . A Miss Miranda Greene to see you . Lord Graves . What an unexpected surprise . Here 's your money . All of it . I 'm just glad that I got out now before any real damage was done . You ca n't bluff me . You 're right . Then there 'd be more to give back . Come back here , you little strumpet ! I rather enjoyed that . Welcome to Windsor Castle , Your Majesty . The Prime Minister will be here shortly . There 's something he wishes to talk to you about . The peak goes to the front , Your Majesty . Now that you 've handled the Zambezi reception so famously ... we feel that you 're ready to help us with a matter of even greater national import . I do n't know if you 're aware of it ... but Finland recently discovered large oil deposits in their area of the Baltic Sea . One of our companies is bidding for the contract ... to supply all the platforms and drilling equipment ... a contract that could create thousands of jobs in the Northeast . Unfortunately , we 're getting spirited competition from the Japanese . I 've heard they can be a problem . What are we hunting , Ced ? I believe it 's pheasant , Your Majesty . However , we have one more ace to play . The King of Finland is due here in two weeks on a state visit . - Is this gun loaded , Ced ? - Yes . You will , in keeping with tradition , be hosting a royal banquet for him . I 'm afraid we wo n't be able to get by on pretzels and beer this time . The king will be with his daughter ... Princess Anna , one of the most socially desirable women in the world . Does that mean she 's ugly ? Far from it . We 're organising a ball in her honour to follow the banquet ... so that you two can get to know each other better . Excuse me , Your Majesty . The beaters are approaching . Here they come , Your Majesty . They 're over . - Did I get one ? - Fortunately , it 's only a flesh wound . Now , if everything proceeds as it should ... This is going too far . You ca n't tell me who to marry . - Is n't being king worth something ? - Yes , that 's why you must marry . - To protect your birthright . - What about matters of the heart ? They must be subordinated to the good of the monarchy . You 're the last of the Wyndhams . A queen must be found to perpetuate the line . Princess Anna is the best of the acceptable candidates . I know it 's difficult , but there are times when you must put aside personal desires . A king 's life is not always his own ! - You 're serious about this . - Yes ! Well , I got news for ya . My life is my own and I ca n't take this shit any more . I got everything in the world and nothin ' I need . No friends , no freedom , no fun . I 'm outta here ! You 'd walk out on the English people ? - I told you I was the wrong guy for this . - You 're wrong for everything , Ralph . Who are you callin ' ' Ralph ' ? It 's ' Your Majesty ' ! Not any more . You quit , just as you quit the bear scouts . - Cub scouts . - Little League , high-school band ... three colleges and an assortment of jobs too numerous to mention ! Now you want me to quit on Miranda and any chance at a normal life . That shirt is not yours . I was n't born to this crap . You ca n't expect me to accept these restrictions . What of the thousands of workers who will benefit ? - Maybe something else 'll come along . - Will it ? Are you willing to bet their future on it for a woman you 've known a few weeks ? You want me to marry one I do n't know at all ! To accept responsibility for once ... without beating retreat at the first sign of difficulty . The throne of England is not a job to be discarded when it 's your bowling night ! First sign of difficulty ? You 've been destroying my fantasy for weeks . It 's up to you whether you embrace this situation as a challenge to your abilities ... or simply to chalk it up as another failure , a monument to your own passivity . I think it 's time you made a stand somewhere for something . If not now , then when ? There 's no guarantee I 'll be attracted to her . Then we 'll get her a G-string and some pasties ... but you must not shrink from your duty . To refuse to receive her now would be disastrous for England . Your family , your government and the people of England are counting on you . You owe it to them and to yourself . OK , I 'll give it a shot . Thank you , Your Majesty . - Miranda ? - There 's something I have to tell you . - Yeah , I was just gon na call you . - I do n't think we should see each other . - What ? I mean , I really wish I could . You just have to trust me . It 's not a good idea . Yeah , they 're puttin ' the pressure on me over here , too . It could never have worked out . Sure , I understand . I guess we should just be glad for the time we had , that kind of thing . We did have a good time , did n't we ? Please do n't think badly of me . No . It just was n't meant to be . Yeah . Goodbye , Miranda . Bye . Ralph . Now , I have a little errand for you , Gordon . My Lord ? This is my invitation to the Finnish ball . Make sure that Miss Greene gets one just like it . - Of course . Shoulder ... arms ! Royal salute ! Present ... arms ! Welcome . On behalf of the people of the United Kingdom ... it 's a pleasure to have you as our guest . Thank you , Your Majesty . We are honoured by your invitation . - May I present Queen Katherine . - Queen Katherine . - And Princess Anna . - Princess Anna . It 's a pleasure to meet you . Allow me to introduce the Prime Minister , Mr Geoffrey Hale . Your Majesty . Your Majesty . Your Royal Highness . With His Majesty 's compliments . He also instructed me to give you this . I have no doubt that they will be the toast of the continent . Good evening , Your Majesty . Lord Percival Graves . I know that you will acquit yourself as famously with the Finnish royals ... as you have in your other endeavours . One word of advice , if I may . If things become too staid , too formal for you ... With your lustrous charm ... I would n't be afraid to show them who you really are . Thanks . I 'll try to keep that in mind . Majesty . His Britannic Majesty , King Ralph I ... and Their Royal Majesties , King Gustav and Queen Katherine of Finland ... and Her Royal Highness , Princess Anna . I am told you are something of a sportsman . My particular passion is polo . - No game like it for a gentleman . - I 've heard that . If I ever get to be one , I 'll take it up . Do you ever do any fencing ? Just a little , when I was a kid . A couple of watches here and there . - The princess is lovely , is n't she ? - She does n't say much ... but she is what they call in America a fox . I am glad you find her so . Best wishes in your fox-hunting , Your Majesty . - Really ? That often ? You must have collected several tails . Well , I admit I slept with a few , but I 'm not like that any more . Nowadays you ca n't be too careful . You never know who they 've been with . No ... I suppose not . Of course , once I had a steady girl , that put an end to it . - She did n't like fox-hunting ? - Well , of course not ! Anna is n't into it , is she ? Oh , yes , she loves it . Most royals do . Gustav , let the king eat . His guests are waiting . Right . Sorry , they do n't feed the chickens enough over here . Excuse me . Just spectacularly bad luck . It could have happened to almost anyone . I 'd be better off doing things my way . When I try to do things right I screw up . All is not lost , Your Majesty . Shall we dance ? - You dance great . - Oh , thank you . So do you . I 'm curious about what kind of things you like . Oh , I do n't know . Certainly the fine arts . The opera , the ballet , the symphony . - And I love to travel . - Oh , yeah ? Me too . - Have you ever been to Hoover Dam ? - No , I missed that one . - We prefer Deauville . - Deauville ? France . Daddy played in the Gold Cup there this summer . - Then , of course , we went to Ascot . - Oh . What country is that in ? England . What do you say that we take a little breather ? - It seems to be going well , Willingham . - Yes . We 've been settin ' a torrid pace in there . I hope the rest of our life is n't as wild . Now that we 've gotten to know each other ... I need to talk to you about this . Do n't you think we should develop some special feelings for each other first ? It would be a charming bonus , but I hardly think it 's necessary . We 're royals . We marry for the ... position . If I wanted to marry for love ... I would have married Gunnar Jann back in Penike . But do you really wan na marry me ? Well , I must admit , you 'll require a bit more work than I 'd hoped . You are unsophisticated , ignorant and totally lacking in social grace . But I console myself with the fact that you have nice buttocks . I beg your pardon ? As you were dancing ... I drowned the memory of your behaviour at dinner ... with a vision of you bending me over the Queen-Anne desk ... in the white drawing room . Would n't that be uncomfortable , with all those pens ? Yes . Or best of all ... - I would hope so . Ah , there you two are ! Come , Anna . You have n't danced with your father . Coming , Father . Yes , yes , they do make a lovely couple . - How 's it going , Your Majesty ? - Great . We have nothing in common , she sounds like a tuba ... she wants to have sex on a bed of nails on national TV ... but at least the party stinks . I got ta do something to liven things up . Time for some of that American flamboyance . - Your Majesty . - I got a little number I 'd like to do . - You guys got a piano ? - No , but we 've got a harpsichord . Good enough . Let 's go over the changes . Thank you . - You guys ready ? - We 'll do the best we can , Your Majesty . Ladies and gentleman , I 'd like to welcome you all to the ball again . Since this is the biggest audience I 've ever had ... I 'd like to play somethin ' for ya , maybe pick up the tempo , get things rollin ' . This is a sweet Little Richard Penniman tune . A little rusty . Here you go . Help me out here . Thanks . Coat was cramping ' my style . # Yeah , good golly , Miss Molly # Good golly , Miss Molly # Good golly , Miss Molly # Whoa , you got me , Miss Molly , yeah # Good golly , Miss Molly # Whoa ! # Good night ! Thanks . You 've been a wonderful audience . Thanks a lot , guys . - Great to see you ! Why are you here ? - What do you mean ? - Who is this girl ? - Miranda . Who are you ? I am Princess Anna , the king 's future bride . Future bride ? I see . Excuse me , I think I should be going . No , wait , Miranda . I can explain this . Sorta . - Anna , we are going . - I want to know who that girl was . I 'm sure His Majesty regrets ... In the wake of last night 's disastrous royal ball ... the Finnish government has awarded its equipment contract to a Japanese firm . King Ralph not only shocked his guests with his rock-and-roll gyrations ... but further insulted King Gustav and Princess Anna of Finland ... by parading with his " mystery woman " , a former stripper named Miranda Greene . Business and political leaders have condemned ... Never , in recent times , has a monarch so shamed and embarrassed his country . - Hear ! Hear ! - Must we stand idly by ... and suffer the degradation of our most sacred traditions ... by this witless ivory-tinkler from across the sea ? I say no ! Hear , hear ! I say it is time to reclaim our heritage . Hear , hear ! I say it is time to reclaim our national pride . Hear , hear ! I say it is time to reclaim our throne ! Hear , hear ! Sorry , Grandpa . Maybe I should have myself beheaded . Tommie , this is Ralph . I need a favour . - Mrs Greene ? - Yes ? Hi . Is Miranda here ? As I live and breathe ! You 're him , are n't you ? Just barely . I know I should n't have come , but I wanted to see you . Parliament wants me to resign . Hale agrees . - You 're not gon na do it , are you ? - I do n't know . I 've never done anything of importance . I usually bail out long before that . But I am the king , even if I should n't be . I do n't wan na be the last of the line ... the one who embarrassed the country and had to crawl out the back door . King Ralph the Chickenhearted . - What do you think I should do ? - I 'm in no position to give advice . After we first met at the club ... - Lord Graves came to see me . - Graves ? He offered me money to help my family ... if I would ... see you ... and compromise you in some way . You went for it ? You let him bribe you ? - To begin with . - I do n't believe this . Ever since I 've been here , I 've had people sayin ' ... ' Stay away from her . She 's the wrong class . ' And I ignored ' em ! I kept tellin ' myself ' Everything 'll work out fine once they know you like I do ... once they find out what a great gal you were . ' And you were settin ' me up ! What did they give you for the night in the park ? Triple-word score ? It was n't like that . After that night , I gave Graves his money back . - I did n't know he already had photos . - Yeah , right ! I wish I could believe that . I do n't expect you to , or to believe that I 've missed you . But I wish we could still see each other . I was stupid . I was offered an easy way out of my problems and I took it . I did n't think about the consequences . I do n't know what to think any more . I 've been in over my head all along . The only thing I was ever sure of was you . You were England to me , Miranda . Come in . You wanted to see me , Your Majesty ? Yes , Gordon , I 'd like something . Anything , Your Majesty . No . Just an explanation . I 'll see what I can find out , Your Majesty . Perhaps you can ' find out ' why the note is written in your handwriting . I ... do n't know anything ... about ... anything . - Good day , Your Majesty . - Your Majesty . - Got a second ? Of course . It 's been a rather disturbing day . Yes , it has , but that 's not why I wanted to see you . I was thinking of something you said to me once . Most things go in one ear , out the other ... no offence ... but this stuck with me . You said you were nervous when you first decided on me or something like that . - Did I say that , Your Majesty ? - Yes , you did . - The word ' decide ' got me thinking . - Did it , Your Majesty ? Yes , it did . Now , I 'm the king , right ? - Oh , yes , indeed . - And as my assistant private secretary ... you are sworn to give me whatever information I might need , are n't you ? Yes , Your Majesty . All right then , Phipps . Fess up . Have a seat . I 've been talking to Dunc about something he said a while back . It came out there was another guy in line for the throne besides me . Is that true ? I 'm afraid it is , Your Majesty . Was his claim as strong as mine ? Almost , yes . His great grandfather had an unfortunate evening with a parlour maid . - So he was English ? - Yes . Then why was n't he chosen over me ? He begged to be let off . He insisted that he was undeserving of such an exalted position . In other words ... you just could n't face it . Yes , Your Majesty , I could n't . I did n't feel worthy and I have no children to continue the line . So I swore Phipps to silence and decided to stay on as your private secretary . Why ? So you 'd pick up a few pointers , just in case ? I was determined to help you do the job so well ... I am sorry , Your Majesty , both for my deception and my cowardice . I probably ought a be pissed ... but I had nothin ' else goin ' and I did n't get shot . Plus you are a relative . Thank you , Your Majesty , for your tolerance . Call the Prime Minister . I wan na address Parliament . Parliament ? ! Parliament . My Lords , members of the House of Commons ... His Majesty , Ralph I , by the grace of God ... King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ... Head of the Commonwealth , Defender of the Faith . Please be seated . My Lords and members of the House of Commons . It 's unusual for a king to address Parliament ... but I have some things to say and I wan na say them first-hand . As you all know , I have made some terrible mistakes lately ... I know I ca n't undo what 's been done . I can only try to make up for it in some way . With that in mind , I placed a call last night to King Mulambon of Zambezi . I am happy to be able to announce ... that Zambezi will begin production of Africa 's first car by the end of the year ... and , in a deal worked out with Prime Minister Hale ... all of the engines will be built right here in England . This means opening three manufacturing and assembly plants in the Northeast . In addition , Zambezi wants to buy ? 200 million worth of English heavy equipment ... to help in the mining of their vast national resources . Yeah ! As happy as I am about all this , it does n't make up for my shortcomings as a king . I have done my best to learn the ways of royalty ... to try to be the kind of king you could be proud of . For that reason , I have decided to give up my throne . But before I go , there are some things I wan na set straight . Since I became king , one member of this house has worked to discredit me ... hoping that his family would return to the throne . The so-called scandalous photographs you 've heard about ... were taken and given to the King of Finland ... by a man working for Lord Percival Graves . This is an outrage ! A vile piece of slander ! I demand to know the source of these accusations ! We have the confession of a royal page , Gordon Halliwell , who worked with you . I know no such man ! And several cheques made out to the photographer , signed by Lord Graves ... - ... whose fingerprints were on the photos . - So ? I saw them at the ball . Scotland Yard found the negatives in his house this morning . By what right can you order my arrest ? By the Treason Act of 1702 ..... Charlie , Charlie , James again ... William III . Shame ! That 's right . String ' I'm up . Wanker ! I did n't bring this out to defend myself , but I embarrassed England unintentionally . Graves did it deliberately . This is kinda where my notes run out . I guess I 'll have to wing it from here . I just wan na say that when I first came here , I hardly knew where England was . But over the last few months , something has changed . I 'll always consider myself an American ... but I 've come to feel like I 'm English , too . I now realise how important a king can be to his people if he 's the right man . I also know that I 'm too set in my ways to ever be that man . As an Englishman , I want all of us to have the kind of king we deserve . For that reason , tomorrow I 'm turning over the throne to Cedric Charles Willingham ..... and a better , more qualified man than any nation could hope for . And so to him I pledge my allegiance . Long live Cedric I , by the grace of God ... King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ... Head of the Commonwealth , Defender of the Faith . God save the king . God save the king ! Well , I ca n't help it ! I 'm gon na miss the geezer , all right ? And one last thing . There 's been some discussion ... and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has suggested ... a healthy annual income and a house in the country befitting your status . I do n't know , Ced . I should stay out of the royalty business . You would n't have any official obligations ... and I 'm having this house equipped with its own recording studio . Maybe I should give this a little more thought . I think so . After me , you 're still the only Wyndham left ... I know you 'll do a hell of a job . You got the breeding , the know-how , you 've practically been king already . You 'll probably have to work on your dancing , though . And feel free to change the decor . Just a dab here and there . Anyway , I wan na thank you for everything you did for me . I could n't have made it without you . And you too , Dunc , and Tommie . It 's I who should be thanking you . You showed me how to be a king . Me ? I was a lousy king . On the contrary . You are a good and decent man ... and you 've acted honourably . I shall try to follow your example . Thank you , Ced . Hey , do n't forget the crown . Practise wearing it to get used to the weight . So long , Tommie . Good luck , Your Majesty . So long , Dunc . Goodbye , Your Majesty . So long , Your Majesty . I proclaim you Ralph Hampton Gainsworth Jones ... Third Duke of Warren . # Duke , duke , duke # Duke of Earl , duke , duke # Duke of Earl , duke , duke # Duke of Earl # Duke of Earl , duke , duke # Duke of Earl , duke , duke ... Watch your back . All right . I see it . Ma'am . This for the living room ? Yeah . This is one of the nicest houses we 've ever moved anyone like you into . It 's got gas heat , air conditioned , harvest gold fixtures in the kitchen . If you like that kind of thing . Some of the ladies do . Hey , Linda , what do you think ? I always promised you a nice house somewhere in America . Let 's not get carried away , OK , Vinnie ? It 's gon na be a lot easier if you start calling each other Terry and Todd . It 's a nice house , Terry . okay ? No , you 're Terry and he 's Todd . Wait for me ! Let 's take a look inside . Come on . Thanks . I 'll need your social security number So I can process your payment . My what ? Your social security number so we can pay you . 2 . 2 . 1 . 1 . 5 . 5-dash . 6 . 6 . - 2 . - 1 . - 1 . 2 , 5 . 2 ... That 's one too many numbers . Take off the 5 . If you have any problems at all , call my office in San Diego . They always know where I am . Truth is , I 'm usually there . We 'll let you know as soon as we know when we 're going to New York to testify . Great . Great . Thanks for everything . You 'll like it here . It 's a nice community . I 'd live here myself if my wife did n't ... Did n't hate it , right ? No , no , no . Take my word . She 'd hate it . She has to be near town because she works with athletes . If you ever want baseball tickets , give me a call . Great . Baseball . The Padres play the Mets every so often . Though you folk are probably Yankee fans . Most organized crime people are . I love the Yankees . If you have questions , give me a call . Thanks . I really appreciate it . This is my job . I get paid . You do n't tip FBI men . Sure , you do . Yo , Frankie . Oh . You think this guy 's for - - hey ! There 's a 4:00 nonstop out of here . You really going back to New York ? You 'll find another wife . I know . I could 've pulled out months ago . You would n't have gotten the big house Or the extra allowance for the spouse . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Next time I see you , you 'll be eating white bread . You 'll probably even like it . It 's not bad with egg salad . It 's better than the slammer . Keep telling yourself that , sweetheart . You might believe it after a while . And stay out of my purse while I 'm on the phone . I was n't in your purse . Yes , you were ! I 'd like a cab at -- What the frig is the address here ? How should I know ? Number 1 Happy Street . You know what the guy tried to do ? No idea . I have n't met a criminal in years . He tried to tip me . Can you believe that ? How much ? 100 bucks . 100 bucks ? That 's not the point . The point is the man proffered a gratuity . It 's against protocol . I ca n't accept that . No , I know you ca n't . Not to mention it was insulting . Task completed , Coopersmith ? Yes , sir . This is n't going to take a lot of my time . This guy 's living in the middle of nowhere . Is there anything else I could take on in addition to my regular duties , sir . Coopersmith , This is an extremely important government witness . When you 've delivered him to his 2 court appearances , then we 'll talk about something else . I do n't want to fill out any more forms . I want to go undercover . I want to stake out some son of a bitch in a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and eat a lot of takeout food . I want to wear a windbreaker . Once , when I was undercover , I got to drive a BMW . I know . I ca n't help it . It was the high point of my life . I 'm getting back into undercover work . Forget it , Kirby . It 's against regulations . There 's overtime involved . You ca n't catch criminals in the FBI If there 's overtime involved . Something could change . Things change . Yeah . Right . This is San Diego all sports radio . We 're talking about last night 's game . Another heartbreaking loss by the home team . The Pads , way ahead , lost in the ninth when Wally Bunting walked in the winning run . I guess so . Relief pitching . It 's a high-risk occupation . Anybody could blow a 7-run lead . 8 . Whatever . They 're sending me down . To the minors ? To Wichita . I 'm sorry , Wally . I 'm gon na miss you . Margaret will miss you , too . I 'm sure . I mean , therapists are n't supposed to say that they 'll miss their patients , so how do I know ? Boy , this is the second relief pitcher she 's lost to the minors this season . I 'm going too , Barney . Where ? To Wichita . Why on earth would you go to Wichita ? How old are you ? 26 . Look , I 'm sorry , Barney , But it 's just no fun here . You 're no fun . What do you mean I 'm no fun ? You get the oil changed on the second Tuesday , you get the car washed on the fourth Thursday . Look at how you eat pancakes . What 's wrong with the way I eat pancakes ? How does he eat pancakes ? He has a system for eating pancakes . So the bottom pancake gets as much syrup as the top one . He has a system for everything . Wally . An error cost the Padres the game . The losing streak now stands at 4 in a row . KBAJ now ends its broadcast day . The score again-- L.A . 5 , San Diego 3 . Thank you very much . You 're welcome . Have a nice day . Good morning , sir . Would you like to try a vanilla bran oat crunchie ? What do you think ? Have a nice day . Fuck you ! That 'll be $12.36 . Wow ! A hundred . Excuse me , sir . I hope you had a very pleasant shopping experience . Yeah . Good ! Here 's a form for our suggestion box . What 's that ? It 's a vegetable . Car 274 to headquarters . Car 274 to headquarters . Male subject apprehended driving stolen green Chrysler . Hey , Hannah , Got a grand theft auto just waiting for you . Let me at him . And let me know when you 're done with him , because I could use him . He makes the hairs on the back my neck stand up . The hairs on the back of your neck ? Yes . That has never happened to me . I 've never been interested in anyone on any level unless I know ... if he 's a college graduate . Yes . OK , that probably seems quite comical to you . It 's your life . Suit yourself . I did ... and look where it got me . Todd Wilkinson , I 'm Hannah Stubbs . I 'm the assistant district attorney . How you two girls doing ? What robbery ? I borrowed a guy 's car . He gave you the keys . But he did n't . Right . If he 'd left them , I would n't have had to jump start it . How do you happen to know how to jump start a car ? I learned it in the army . I was in the motor pool , and everyone was always losing their keys . The entire United States army would n't have moved had it not been for me jump starting it . And it came in handy on several occasions - - jump starting ambulances in order to get invalids to the dialysis machines . What was the name of , um ... what was his name ? Eddie . Eddie what ? That 's all I know . He drives a blue Nova . You were n't picked up in a blue Nova . It was a green Chrysler . Oh . Well , that explains it . I jump started the wrong car . I was in a hurry . I was on my way to church to say some Novenas for Thanksgiving . It 's an American holiday . And I 've been to Italy -- To Florence , right ? Yes . Ever been to Sicily , by any chance ? No . Thanksgiving is very big in Sicily on account of the large number of Sicilians who went to America and then got thrown back out . There were 2 cases of liquor in the back seat of that car . People drink too much . Those 2 cases of liquor were reported stolen from Kelly 's Liquor on Fifth Street earlier today . You 're kidding me . I accidentally borrowed the wrong car of a guy who stole some liquor earlier today ? The car you stole belongs to the Reverend Malcolm Dickenson . He is the minister of the Presbyterian church here in Fryburg ! Are you sure he 's a minister ? One of my best friends makes his living as a completely phony minister . For 2 bucks , I can make you a minister . Now ? Can you see him ? What 's the license number ? Ma'am ? E-N-4 -- Oh , uh , down the hall , One flight up to your left . Thank you . E-N-4 . Call me Vinnie . It says here your name 's Todd . Barney Coopersmith , FBI . Hannah Stubbs of the district attorney 's office . What 's going on , Vinnie ? You 've got a ring of phony ministers stealing liquor . Make me a minister . I 'll go undercover , infiltrate them . We 'll nail all these -- OK , knock it off . What have you got ? Grand theft auto . Felony theft . Where 's the car we gave you ? If I knew , I would n't have borrowed the other one . We 're arraigning him in the morning . No , you 're not . We most certainly are . This man is in the federal witness program . He 's under the protection of the FBI . What are you doing in my purse ? Just looking . Come on , Vinnie . Let 's go . You 're a good-looking girl , except for those army shoes . No wonder he split . Come on . You ought to get a pair of nice high heels . Spectator pumps , I think they 're called . Where are you going ? This man is a member of an organized crime family . They put that stamp on everybody . It 's a stereotype , and I resent it . He has to testify at 2 major mob trials in New York in the immediate future , so therefore you are not going to arraign him for anything tomorrow . Now wait just a minute . This is not a dump site for the toxic waste of criminal America . That 's my last mint . Spit that out ! Spit that out and return it to this woman ! Bring him back here ! Lady , this man is much more important than a couple of petty larcenies . That 's your opinion . You do n't live here . Oh , really ? Oh , really ? Oh , really ? You got ta do better than that . You 're going to lose the argument . Stay out of this . How long have you been in this job , 2 weeks ? Go to hell ! Just go to hell ! Way to go ! What if he promises not to do it again ? Do me a favor . Tell her you wo n't do it again . I did n't do anything in the first place , which is what I was trying to explain . I am not happy about this ! Lady , this is justice department policy . Well , they 're wrong . They 're wrong , and I 'm right ! Let me ask you something . Have you ever been wrong about anything ? Yes . Once . The shoes , right ? The shoes are tragic . Creep . Disgusting , revolting , creep ! I thought he was cute . Not that one . Tommy and I are going down to grandma 's house For Thanksgiving with dad . Do you remember dad ? Yeah , he used to live here . We 're going to be back on Sunday night , though . Promise you wo n't flush him down the toilet ? I ca n't promise anything . Mom ! I promise . Come here . You scared me . So what 's up ? What are you doing today , mom ? I 'm working , So it 's just as well you 're going . I would n't be here anyway . Do you still love our dad ? No , but I still love you . " and your dad loves you . That 's all that really matters . " Mm-hmm . Hey , everybody ready ? Hi , dad . Hi . Now go on . Have a good time . We 'll talk about this when you get back Sunday . Bye , mom . Bye , mom . Hi , dad . Let 's go ! What , I 'm supposed to ring the doorbell in my own house ? This is not your house anymore . I may not live here , but it 's still my house . He made me drink . I 'm drinking in solitary . Look at me . I-I 'm cleaning in solitary . Of course , you always clean in solitary . There 's nothing new in that , But still , drinking , muttering to myself , Compulsively scrubbing . Oh ! I do n't like this , Kirby . Really . The guy 's hanging around a bar . He 's looking to buy stolen credit cards . Could be a major criminal conspiracy . I do n't know . We go undercover . We blow this thing out of the water . Who made you undercover ? I did . It does n't work that way . This is your big chance . These are not the good one's . They got a limit . They do n't all have limits . They might not be valid . I work at the post office . I do n't know your name , though . My name is Todd Wilkinson . Mrs . Stubbs ! Hey , Mrs . Stubbs ! We got one ! We got us a criminal . No , we do n't . We got us a criminal we already had . Mrs . Stubbs ! As I live and breathe . It 's me , Vinnie . I know who you are . I just met you . Oh ! Oh , darn it . Brand-new shoes . No , these are old shoes . It 's a miracle they lasted as long as they did . There could definitely be a transfer of stolen goods taking place right in front of our eyes . Do n't be an idiot . What 's with you lately ? I 'll take care of this . Go home to your wife and family . Hey , you can drive away . I wo n't follow you . I have another errand to run , if you do n't mind . I find that hard to believe . It 's Thanksgiving . I 'm in a community where I know no one but my bartender . My wife , God rest her soul , died 3 years ago to the day . I 'm sorry to hear that , but that is no excuse for criminal behavior . Like your shoes , it 's a miracle she lasted as long as she did . Aw , jeez ! Look at these guys . Look how cute they are . Look at them frolic like this . I 'm sorry , Mrs . Stubbs . I miss my dog , too . They made me leave my dog behind . How you guys doing , huh ? They would n't let you take your dog ? He only answered to his name . What was his name ? Fungole . Oh ! Need some help ? Yes . Hey , hey , hey . Boo , boo , boo . I 'm not really . It 'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog . What are you doing ? All right , come on . There you go . Oh , God . I wish I could remember what the other one looked like . The turtle died , and you 're going to pass another turtle off as the dead turtle , right ? Right . Trust me . They all look alike . That one . Pretty bird . Pretty bird . Polly want a cracker . It do n't say Polly want a cracker . What do it say ? You 're under arrest . I once knew a guy had a parrot said that . Yeah ? $2.04 with tax . Is that correct ? Right . Thank you very much . You 're under arrest . I think I 'm going to stay behind and get me a new dog . Excellent . I 'm very happy for you . You dirty rat . I already said you dirty rat . Yeah , but I say it better . Johnny Bird ! I thought you was dead . That was the general idea . Billy Sparrow . Todd Wilkinson . Ooh , that 's a good one . Who 's the dame ? An assistant D.A . I recently made the acquaintance of . They picked you up ? Misdemeanor . They do n't have misdemeanors here . They just have felonies . Where 's Linda ? She could n't take it . Jeez , I 'm glad to see you . I was feeling so ... alone . You 're not alone . You are really not alone . Toot , toot ! Barney ! Barney , what a day . What a great day ! What are you doing here , Vinnie ? What am I doing here ? I live here . I live here . We got to talk . What 's the matter ? You seem down . I 'm not down . You look depressed . That 'll cheer you up . I got to talk to you . I 'm with you . I have a job , OK ? I 'm with you . My job 's to protect and safeguard you so you can testify at 2 major trials that are gon na send people to jail who are significantly more important than you . When you testify , they 'll try to destroy your credibility . If you get into trouble here you 'll just make it easier for them to tear you down . I 'm with you . So you can not commit credit card fraud . Who says I committed credit card fraud ? Yo , Todd . Hey , how you doing ? We have pictures of it . I 'm trying to tell you , I 'm with you . When I say I 'm with you , I do n't mean it like an expression like I 'm saying I know what you mean . I mean , I 'm with you . I 'm with the government . I 'm ready to testify . He 'll go to jail . I do n't want you to testify . I want you to keep your nose clean . Capeece ? You trying to say capisce ? Yeah . Well , do n't do it , Because it hurts my ears when you do it . Just out of curiosity , where 's your wife ? She , uh ... got the chicken pox . It 's terrible . She 's in the hospital . Really ? Did you tell somebody she was dead ? Who told you this ? OK , OK . Maybe I said it . She left me , Barney . Walked out the door . Yeah , well , my wife left me , too . When did this happen ? In October . That 's when mine broke up . What is it about October ? I do n't know . The pressure of Halloween ? You never know what to go as . That cute D.A . That 's who I told . Hey . No , not my type . I like them a little , uh ... I do n't know . Kind of dirty or something . You ought to take her out . You ought to marry her . I 'm still married . A guy in Reno will marry you even if you 're still married . I 'll arrange the whole thing . Do me a favor . Do n't arrange anything . Do n't do anything . Just lay low until we get through New York . Stay out of trouble . I 'm with you . What 's this ? Oh . Surprise ! Surprise ! Rocco Bamonte ! Peter Baker . Peter Baker ? That 's fantastic . Richie Paolucci . No , no , no . Michael Peterson . I was your pallbearer . I appreciate it , Vinnie . Vinnie ! Nicky the Fish ! What are you doing here ? It 's great to see you , Vin . Hey ! Dino ! How are you , Dino ? Boy , Vinnie , you look good . There 's nothing in it . Last week I drove 43 miles to a restaurant I heard had good marinara sauce . How was it ? Please . They way I look at it , this is where you go when you die . Everything 's so clean . Everybody 's so nice . Good we 're not broke , or we 'd really be miserable . I 'm broke . But you get your check every week From the government , right ? How long you think you get your check ? Forever . Yeah ? Here 's to forever . What are you saying ? Read the fine print . They only send you the check till you testify . Then ... they actually expect you to go to work . Bastards . Creeps . What the hell ? We should go into business . There 's enough of us here to start a crime wave . Hold it . Come on , come on . Bring it in . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hijacking . See you guys later . Now , Vin , remember , no speeding ! Watch yourself . OK , boys , back to work . We are not accusing you of anything but speeding at the moment , Mr . Wilkinson , but I 'd like very much to know about the items in your trunk . Which items ? Well , let 's start with the cassette players . I do n't know anything about cassette players . There were 40 of them in your trunk . Oh . A guy I know won those in a contest . They were part of a shipment that was hijacked 4 days ago on the way to Radio Shack . Oh , that 's terrible . And the swordfish ? I know this guy . His whole life is fishing , But he caught too many fish , so he asked me , would I keep some fish in my freezer , but I do n't have any room in my freezer on account of another guy I know giving me a side of beef . Mr . Wilkinson ... put the ball away and sit down ! The books . You got something against books ? I have nothing against books . I 'm curious about the books in your trunk . You see , I was thinking of writing my story , so I bought this book on how to do it . Why do you need 25 copies of it ? In case I want to read it more than once . I 'm sure it will come as no surprise to you to learn these books were part of a shipment that was hijacked yesterday on the way to B . Dalton 's . No ! Yes ! Mr . Wilkinson -- How 's the turtle , Mrs . Stubbs ? Fine , thank you . Did your kids ever figure out you switched turtles on them ? Because I know it would be a major disappointment for them to find out . Did you have a warrant to search his trunk ? No . See , she did n't even have probable cause . You had no right to search . Probable cause . Jefferson put that in the constitution . Not for you . I 'm exactly the guy he put it in for . Mrs . Stubbs , I admire your zeal . Do n't patronize me . I 'm the worst-case scenario of Jefferson 's dreams . This way . Presumably , the statute of limitations will not have run out -- I 've been thinking of advising this man to get involved with you , but now I 'm afraid I ca n't , because you are definitely losing your sense of humor . You ca n't touch him . I can , too ! If you ever had a sense of humor . When you finish testifying , All bets are off . Everybody thinks they 're humorous , but they 're not . See ? No sense of humor whatsoever . Care for something to drink , ma'am ? No , thanks . Something to drink , sir ? Let me borrow that pen again . What can I get you two to drink today ? Ginger ale for me . 2 double scotches , please . We 're only allowed to sell you 2 drinks . 2 double scotches would be 4 drinks . I see . All right , how about this ? You sell me my double scotch and you sell my friend his double scotch , but instead of putting his on his tray , you put it on mine , and I 'll pay for you both . You look fantastic in red and blue ... PAM . All right , then . That 'll be $12 . OK , and , uh ... keep the change , please . We 're not allowed to accept tips . Not allowed to accept tips . You tip a flight attendant ? I tip everybody . That 's my philosophy . See , actually , It 's not tipping I believe in . It 's overtipping . I think this is the kind of thing people would like to know . Give me that pen again . American airlines flight 550 for San Francisco is now boarding ... Vinnie , tomorrow morning you 'll be seeing the prosecutors . Tomorrow morning I have an appointment with my tailor . You 're going over testimony . Gaetano 's expecting me at 10:00 . The next day you 'll testify , after which we 'll go back . Do n't let anyone know who you are or that you 're in town . You 'll telephone no one . If anyone looks like they know you ... Vinnie ! Vinnie ! Welcome home ! We love you , Vinnie ! Welcome home , Vinnie ! I do n't believe this ! Are you crazy ? Nobody knows I 'm here but them . I ca n't do that , Vinnie . Do n't make me look like a criminal in front of my mother . Mama . Mama . Oh , mama . Mama . Mio bambino . Mama . Barney . Hey , hey , hey , mama , mama , mama . I thought Wankel invented the rotary engine . Vinnie ? Vinnie ? Vinnie ! Vaca . Where the hell where you all night ? Vinnie , we 're late . We have an appointment downtown . You see what I mean ? Tragic . Barney , take a look at the 2 of us . Take a look . You see , we do n't match . You dress like this , you attract attention to me . That 's dangerous . Wait till you see this . Wow . The worst . It 's a pair of socks . Just try something different . Vinnie , I 'm not interested in this . Of course you 're not . We know this . No wonder your wife left you . She did n't leave me because of my socks . The wardrobe is a symbol of how you are . Now what do you think ? Barney , listen to me . It 's very hard for a human being to change . I know this . I am an expert on this . So , sometimes ... in order for a human being to change , you have to change from the outside in . Wow ! You look beautiful . Come on . Tomorrow , as the Provolone trial continues , the U.S . attorney 's office is expected to call Vincent Antonelli , one of the chief lieutenants to Gazzo until September , when he entered the federal witness protection program . Look how young I look in that picture . Jeez . What do you want from room service ? Nothing . You got to eat something . What I want is linguini at Bruno 's . A little linguini , a little scungilli . I 'll get you some Italian food . Room 606 . Do you have any Italian food ? What does that Italian dressing come on , salad ? OK , I 'll take one of those . And what kind of pasta do you have ? Macaroni and cheese . OK , I 'll take one of those . What 's this Chicken Volavent ? Can you make that without the silky cream sauce ? I just want it in a flaky pastry . OK , fine . Then -- What are you doing ? ! I 'm wrinkling up your jacket like you 're wrinkling your pants . What are you talking about ? Why ? ! You bought a $1,200 suit . You hang up the jacket , but lay around in your pants . You 're wrinkling the pants . Give me your pants . I 'll hang them up . What happens - - give me your pants - - the pants go to the dry cleaners more than the jacket , and you end up with a suit that does n't match . Will I need change ? No . No . They 'll have change down there . I 'll be back in about 5 minutes , OK ? Aarrgh ! Vinnie ! Vinnie ! Vinnie ! So we open up the truck , and what is there but 6,000 watches ? I think , great , 6,000 watches . Hey , how you doing ? But what I do n't realize is that each watch is worth 10 grand . Now if you do your multiplication ... May I help you , sir ? I 'm meeting somebody . Vinnie ! $60 million would buy the bar . So Eddie , make me the drink you made the night Mary was shot . I think it was a Bloody Mary . Psst ! Vinnie . Who 's that ? Come here . It 's Louie ! Louie Vinchenzi from San Francisco . I ca n't believe you did this -- A $1,200 suit on my credit card . You wan na have a good time or sit in the motel ? 18% on my credit card . Annette , give me that gray suit I gave you . I 'll be paying it off the rest of my life . Champagne for everybody ? What a fantastic guy . I could 've bought a VCR . Could 've bought a new car ! Do n't get him mad . I ca n't believe you did this to me . All right . Let 's go . Right now . Relax . This is my territory . Back to the motel . I want to show you something . You see those guys ? Yes , I do . If they find out you 're FBI , we have a problem . You 're a better-looking guy than I am , but I always look them in the eye . Therefore , I 'll always get laid more than you , which is fundamentally unjust , am I right ? You 're into justice . This argument should appeal to you . Come here . What ? Leave your celery . Hiya , girls . How ya doing ? My name 's Vinnie . What 's your name ? Angie . Angie . How are you ? What 's your name ? Marie . I 'd like you to meet my brother-in-law Barney . He invented that valve doohickey on the artificial heart . Do n't ask me to explain it . Barney . What a great name . They always say that , even if your name is Morty . Now look her right in the eye . Hi , Marie . Hi , Barney . What do you say we all dance ? Oh , Vinnie , no . I 'd rather not . Come on . I want to dance . Let 's go . Pull it up . Pump up . What are you doing ? You 're too stiff . You 're slouching . You got ta stand up like this . Buckle your knees a little . Move your hips . Hey , Barney . Put your hand here like this . Ohh . Do it . Now watch this . Do it . Do it . Vinnie ! Aah ! Aah ! Hey , Barney . Yeah , Vinnie ? Where 'd you learn to shoot like that ? In the bureau . Really ? Yep . You saved my life . You saved my life . We 're in each other 's debt forever . That 's so great . Good night , Vinnie . Good night , Barney . And what happened then , Mr . Antonelli ? Mr . Capelli left the room . Did Mr . Gazzo say anything at this point ? Mr . Gazzo said , " kill the fart . " I apologize , your honor , But that 's what he said . And then they had a little eggplant Benny 's mother made . She puts capers in , which I think is a mistake . Then they killed Nicky Capelli . One behind the ear with a .22 . Richie loved to use .22s ' cause the bullets are small and do n't come out the other end like a .45 . A .45 will blow a barn door out the back of your head . Lots of dry-cleaning involved . A .22 will just rattle around like Pac-Man until you die . Thank you , Mr . Antonelli . You 're welcome . Your witness . Mr . Antonelli , Where exactly do you live ? Nowhere . Objection . Mr . Levine knows perfectly well the witness is unable to answer that question . I withdraw the question . Are n't you currently in the federal witness protection program ? Yes . You 're living somewhere in America under the protection of the federal government . You agreed to testify against Mr . Gazzo . That correct ? That 's not all I get . Perhaps you could enlighten the jury as to what else the government 's giving you in exchange for this testimony . Sure . I get to never see my parents again or my loved one's . I get to live in a place ... it 's OK . Do n't get me wrong . The air is clean . The people are nice . But for a guy like me , who was raised on the sidewalks of a city that never sleeps , it 's a living hell . There were times when I thought of giving it up , particularly when my wife left me . They gave us a nice house with flowers in front . It made her sick . But I made a deal with the government , so I 'm here to tell the truth . If you think I 'm saying what I 'm saying about Mr . You can unscrew a light bulb . Michelle , a drink here for my friend . Oh , I could n't possibly . Oh , come on , have a brandy . Monks make it . Vinnie , we 'll have to work so hard next time we come to New York so it wo n't be a letdown after this trip . What a fabulous time I had . Although I got to admit , it will be good to get back home . Barney , I 've been thinking . It does n't make any sense for you to have a problem with that D.A . Get off my back about the D.A . I 'm not talking about romance . I 'm just talking in general . Why make war with the D.A . ? You got ta be out of your mind , especially in your line of work . So when you get back try and make peace with her , a little gesture to show you 're friendly . That 's my philosophy . Hi , Mr . Wilkinson . Hi , Mr . Wilkinson . Hi , kids . How ya doing ? Hi , Todd . Hi , Debbie . Hi , Brodie . What a day for a mow , huh ? Hey , tiger . Where 'd you get that jacket ? You look sharp . Hey , baby . Way to go , Coopersmith . Coopersmith . Good morning , sir . You could use a little help yourself . Who gave me this ? Hi , kids . My name is Todd . I 'm a friend of your mom 's from the office . Hi , I 'm Jamie . I 'm Tommy . What are you doing here ? We have to leave right away . Otherwise we 're gon na miss batting practice . Let 's go . Hey , we ca n't go . We ca n't go . Why not ? Of course you can . Oh , yes ! Where is it ? Does it have a TV ? Awesome . This is rad . Oh , yes ! We ca n't possibly . Oh , mom . Why not ? Please , mom . Yeah , please . Come on . Oh , thank you . Yes ! Hey , mom . Vodka . Put that away right now . Got any vodka ? Hey , there you go . Put your seat belts on . Hey , you do n't have to put them on in this . Hot dogs ! Are these good seats or what ? Here 's a program for you . And you keep track of everything . Never take your wallet out at the ball game . Did n't your mother ever teach you this ? No . Put this away . How many hot dogs do we want , 2 each ? Real men always have 2 . OK , and 2 for your mother . I do n't want a hot dog . And she was right , too . My wife walked out on me at the low point of my life . I thought your wife died . I only wish . 2 , 4 , 6 hot dogs , please . And keep the change on that and remember this section . Pass them down . Pass one to your mom . Barney Coopersmith , what a coincidence . What do you mean ? You invited me . It 's an expression . OK , you go sit next to her . Everything does n't have to be a war with you J . Edgar Hoover types . Hi . Hi . The reason you never take your wallet out at a ball game or anyplace else is that someone 's gon na steal it from you . When you wave your wallet around , they watch where you put it . When you get up to go to the bathroom , they follow you in and use a bumper . See that ? You feel anything ? Well , look at this . So always protect your wallet . Play ball ! Yeah . Play ball . Padres ! Padres ! Padres ! Padres ! Padres ! Padres ! Padres ! Padres ! What ? He was safe . Nice day , huh ? Catch it ! That was awesome . Yeah , how about that ? You kids play baseball ? We play in the field behind the mall . I know that field . It 's in bad condition , though . Every time it rains , it gets all yucky . A dome is what you need . The first little league in America with a dome . Really , it 's a worthwhile cause . You ought to raise money for it . It 's a cocktail party for law-enforcement personnel in the San Diego area . If you 'd like to come with me . Yes . I would . I 'll call you . Ahh . By the way , My name 's Shaldeen . Hiya , Shaldeen . What 's yours ? My name 's Todd . Todd . That 's a beautiful name . It 's Italian for ... " extra special . " Hello . Barney , how ya doing ? What 's going on , Vinnie ? I 'm in Reno . I just got married . You got what ? Married ! Say hello to Shaldeen . Shaldeen , say hello to Barney . Hi , Barney . Hi , Shaldeen . Can you put Vinnie back on , please ? Bye . You love her or what ? I do n't understand . You 're already married . I did n't marry her under my real name . I said , Vinnie , you 're already married . He said , do n't worry . I did n't marry her under my real name . Do n't tell me you 're gon na book him for bigamy ? No . Hannah does n't find him as funny as I do . Of course you have . Everyone thinks they have , even people who do n't . You look nice . Thanks . Do you want to dance ? I 'm a terrible dancer . So am i , but I can do the Merengue . They 're not playing the Merengue . They will . Thank you . 1 , 2 . She 's a therapist . He owns a lumberyard . She left me for one of her patients . He left me for someone I was in a car-pool with . Jamie , the 9-year-old , is the serious one . You know how it is with brothers . If one 's serious , the other one 's funny . Like with me and my brother . You 're the serious one . I 'm the funny one . Really . She moved to Wichita , And I have n't seen her since . I see him constantly . He walks into the house without even knocking . Your kids are at your mothers ? Good morning ! Guys ! Hiya . Hey . Oh ! You want to come into this house , you ring the damn bell ! I 'm sorry . Do you mind getting the door , please ? Thank you . Oh ! Aah ! Oh ! Ooh ! You 've chosen the right agent , sir . Barney , I 've got you the assignment of your dreams ! You 're going undercover , buddy . Congratulations . We 're launching a major sting operation tomorrow . Step into my parlor . At 1300 hours . Synchronize your watches , men . We get to be Canadians ! I still have the witness to look after Until he appears in court . He has one more court appearance . When ? In 3 weeks . This is an important assignment . You 're gon na be out for as long as it takes -- 4 weeks , 8 weeks , however long . I 'll make sure someone 's assigned to your witness . You know how it is when you fall in love . Sir ? Undercover ! Undercover . You ca n't even call ? We 'll be stashed away . You ca n't use the phone for anything that 's not related to the job . Someone could be tapping the phone . You could jeopardize the entire investigation . But you just got here . OK , fellas , this is it . Let 's go ! All right , get this : You 're Harry Redleaf , and you 're Dicky Thorson . You 're from Vancouver , and you 're in town to buy stolen goods rrom a major hijacking ring . They 'll contact you when they 're ready to fence their goods . When will that be ? Not today . It will be whenever it will be . So , me and Barney just sit here waiting ? That 's right . It will be a lot easier If you start calling each other Harry and Dicky . Have a nice day at the office , honey . See you later , darling . Bye , honey . Jesus , look at this shit ! Oh , look at this rain ! Bring it back here , Epstein ! Back it up ! Pull it a little to the left , Just a little bit ! Take it easy ! That 's it , hold it ! Ah , what the hell is this ? Where are the stereos ? How are we going to fence this shit ? All right , guys , what do you got ? We got two big spenders in town . We got nothing to sell them . What the hell are we supposed to do with these ? How many of these we got ? See , you guys see a problem . I see potential . Have a nice day . How you doing ? Would you mind us leaving this bottle here to raise money for the Fryburg little league ? Ha . Not at all . Have a nice day . Hiya , kids ! Give us a clue . Give me some idea . I do n't know what 's happening . We lost contact temporarily . What are we supposed to do in the meantime here ? I 'm wasting the best years of my life for nothing . I got a wife and a family I 'm not with , Dicky , But you do n't hear me complaining . You call me Dicky one more time , And I 'll kill you . Thank you . Hi , Todd ! Hi , Todd ! Hiya , Tommy . Hiya , Jamie . What 's all that money for ? I do n't know . Race ya ! I 'm first , I 'm first ! I do n't know what kind I 'm getting . What can I do for you ? I do n't know yet . Got to look around . That looks really good . Take your time . I 'll get chocolate chip . Coming up . Okey-doke . It 's $1.00 , right ? Mm-hmm , $1.00 . Sorry . Maybe he 'll put in night lights ! No , he 'll put in a dome and astroturf . Mom , you should 've seen the money in the bottle . There 's like trillions of dollars . And it was our idea . Well , not exactly our idea , But we told him how awful the field was . He might even put in bleachers . Oh , yeah ! And astroturf again ! And maybe even a dome . All right . It 's the first time in my life I try to do something for someone , repay my debt to society , and you arrest me for it . He might be telling the truth . It was all for the community . I swear on my mother 's life . Let me do this . I live here . This is my home . For better or for worse . I love it here . And you were going to give the money to the community , were n't you ? Yes . Yes ! Listen , Mrs . Stubbs ... Over here . Against the wall , sir . I 'm a new man . This is not the old me . This is the new me . He seems like a completely different person . He seems totally different . Anyway , I 'm not your problem . You have major crime going on right here under your nose . You 're wasting your time with me . I 'm nothing . I 'm small potatoes . What I could tell you about what 's going on around here if I wanted to , It 's big . Come on , buddy . What if he 's telling the truth ? At least listen to him . OK . What ? Two of the biggest fences in north America Are sitting right here in Fryburg , ready to make a deal on everything in town that is n't nailed down . Am I ? There 's no deal if they 're not here . They 're here . If he said they 're here , they 'll be here . Yeah . Harry Redleaf and Dicky Thorson . From Vancouver . Did I tell you they were from Vancouver , or did I tell you they were from Vancouver ? Let 's go . First left out the door . Here you go . Thank you . They never leave the room . They just sit there like they 're waiting on something . Did I tell you , or did I tell you ? What about male customers buying things for their wives ? They all watch Oprah Winfrey . Police ! Police ! Police ! Freeze ! You 're under ar ... REST . Hannah . Bastard . You bastard ! I had no idea ! For once in my life , I 'm telling -- The deal is off ! Cuff him ! He has to testify again in New York in 3 days , but he not gon na make it now because by tomorrow this story 's in the newspaper . In 24 hours every hit man in America will be here . I seriously doubt that . You want to bet ? I never bet when I 'm sure I 'm right . Presumably you have n't done much betting , since you 've only been wrong once in your life . Twice . Hannah . There you are . Barney ! Thank God ! You got to get me out of this mess ! That 's the way it 's been your whole life . You spill your milk , and somebody else gets to clean it up . Well , I 'm not cleaning up your mess this time . Hey , Barney , lighten up . I 'm sorry . What kind of jail is this ? Oh , I do n't like to use this bathroom , so they let me use the office bathroom . Is n't there a guard ? Everything all right , Vinnie ? Oh , Jimmy , yeah . No problem . Thanks . Come on in . Come on in . Sit down . You have a pillow with your name embroidered on it ? Yeah , Crystal made that for me . It 's nice , is n't it ? Hey ... at least you never got involved with her . I ca n't believe I even suggested it ! Do n't you understand , Vinnie ? I 'm in love with Hannah . And now she hates me , and it 's all your fault . I 'm so pissed at you ! I 'm really pissed , OK ? OK . Yeah , right . I am . Really , I am . I owe you . You saved my life that night in New York . I could never shoot at anyone . I never touched a gun in my life . It doomed me forever to middle management , and that 's the truth . I should do something . What could I do ? Vinnie , do n't do anything . Please , stop doing things . I have to make a phone call . Aw , Vinnie , now what ? I am entitled to make a phone call , am I not ? Oh , jailer . Should I use the office line or the one in the coffee room . Our position , your honor , is that we be permitted to hold Mr . Antonelli without bail . Every day he is on the streets , he commits a crime . And while that may be all right in places like New York where people are used to it , here in Fryburg , every citizen is a victim . Your honor , speaking for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , our position is that Mr . Antonelli must not spend another night in jail . His life is in danger . He must be protected so that he can testify and therefore , we ask that you grant bail and release him in our custody . Your honor , this is exactly what the FBI does . It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit . There 's all this melodrama , as if cartoon hit men in white-on-white ties are going to walk in and try to kill him . Obviously , this is preposterous scenario , the sort of paranoid fantasy that -- Duck ! Duck ! Hannah ! Get down , get down ! You OK ? Move ! Cover the stand ! I got to get out of here . Follow me . Get going , Coopersmith ! Vinnie ! Ah , where is he ? Vinnie ! It 's all right , everybody ! They 're gone ! It 's all right ! Take my gun . Wow . You saved my life . I 'm in your debt forever . That 's how it works . Take me ! Get in . Just pretend I 'm your hostage . I ca n't believe it . You 're actually building this . Yo , Vinnie ! Yo , look at this ! Hey , Dino , Nicky , Benny ! Looking good ! Looking good ! Oh , mom ! Guess what he built . I know . OK , hold on a sec . It 's so awesome . Hannah , Hannah ! Is n't he wonderful ? Why did n't you say anything about this ball park when I arrested you ? What , and ruin the surprise ? You did n't say anything about this ball park because there was nothing to say . You arranged all this from jail to avoid prosecution for embezzlement . Now that hurts . Because this was my intention from the very beginning . The children needed a ball park , and I responded . See ... My favorite uncle , uncle Alfresco , swore to me that he would buy me that bicycle . I counted the days until Christmas . 5:00 , Christmas morning , I run down -- All right . Nobody move . This is just between Vinnie and us . Guys , I 'm in the middle of an anecdote . Come over here and nobody gets hurt . OK , OK . Come on , kids , move back . And everybody just get out of the way ! Take Vincent ! Go , Vinnie ! Aah ! All right , freeze ! Hold it right there ! Nice action . Thanks . I thought you did n't -- I lied . Now , where was I ? Oh , yes . 5:00 , Christmas morning , I run downstairs and look under the tree , And what do I find ? Uncle Alfresco dead on the floor , Shot through the back of the head . Plus , no bicycle . Is n't that right , Barney ? Yeah . Vinnie told me about this little league thing months ago . And the only reason I did n't say anything about it was ' cause it was supposed to be a surprise for the kids . Do you expect me to believe this ? Yes , I do . How about it ? Nice . Very nice . Hey , hey ! Now , when you guys are laying this sod , remember , green side up . Green side up . OK . Hey , Crystal , I want to show you this . Now , what 's gon na happen here ... Hey , peanuts ! Get ice-cold soda ! Hot dogs ! Car radios ! Peanuts ! Peanuts ! CDs ! Get your cannolis , zeppoli , Veal cutlet hero ! Get the new best-seller , how I got here - - adventures in a life of crime and punishment . I must be working out some screwed-up karma . I know what you mean . Who would 've thought we 'd each have two husbands in a row who were in the federal witness program ? But you know , this lawn reminds -- Here , sweetie . Let 's have a good game . Hey , umpire . Yeah ? I got a little proposition to make you . The Fryburg Turtles ... They 're going to win , hmm ? Hmm ? And now , Fryburg city council 's man of the year , Mr . Vincent Antonelli , will throw out the first ball . Hey , all right , all right . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much . Hey , come here , kids . Come on , come . Whoa , look at these guys ! Looking good ! Whoa ! Huh ? How about that , huh ? Whoa ! Merengue ! Oh ! My boy Vinnie ! Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you . Hey , Crystal , how 's our little one ? Turtles all the way ! Play ball ! You know ... Sometimes I even amaze myself . 
@@5221141 Oh , here comes Daddy . How do I look ? - Terrific , Mom . - Good . You know , every payday I like Daddy to see what his last check went for . Assume the position . Hi . Nice to see you . Good to be back . If anyone needs me , I 'll be on the couch . Goodbye . So long . Do n't write . Do n't call . Al , perhaps you did n't see us . I think he 's playing dumb . No , honey . I 've known him for years . He 's not playing . - Where 's the money , Al ? - I got robbed . I was driving home and I drove by the bank , and the street was cordoned off . So I knew I should n't get out of the car , but I did and that 's when they jumped me . - Muggers , Al ? - Worse . Bankers . Bill collectors , electric-company reps that wiry little woman from the water company . They were all there . I felt so violated . But I fought like a wildcat and I think I felt a toe snap when I bit through that water-company babe 's penny loafer . And that gas guy 's gon na be reading meters out of one eye for a while . Well , you know , this is my own fault . The organ grinder who owns the monkey does n't let him have the check . You 're the organ grinder , all right . Hey , what 's this ? Well , it was my handkerchief . Here , boy . Good boy . Hey , kids , look at this . It 's a brochure announcing a monthly shoe-sales contest . And the winner gets a free first-class trip to Hawaii . Well , that 's fine for the winner , but what would Dad get ? So you bowel-constricting vampires I call loved ones think I could n't possibly be a winner , huh ? - No . - Not really . Cherry . But I was a high school hero . And I can do it again . Any man who can score four touchdowns in a single game after a night with your mother is surely capable of new glory . Al Bundy will win this contest and go to Hawaii . - First class . - How come the winner ... - ... only gets one ticket ? - Otherwise he 'd have to take his wife . Where 's the incentive there ? Here he comes . He 's coming in for a pit stop . Sold 24 pair of shoes , and I 'm in third place . Shower me . Squeegee me . Shoe me . Fratella 's in second place , but I can take him . He goes home at night to visit his wife . The sap still loves her . Luckily I do n't have that problem . No time for frivolity . Freshen me . Shirt me . Shoe me . Get away from me . I am now ready to sell . How odd . I only hope that this is not a night in which you need shoes . Well , you know she does , Al , I told you . We have a big , important dinner with the bank president , remember ? Marcie was in the shower , you told me my hair was a mess so of course , I ran off to fix it . When I came back , you were gone . You must have just missed the burglar . Anyway , hey , how 's my hair ? Soft , yet manageable . Now , Marcie , as a friend who 's also in the business let me fix you up with a nice pair of shoes . Now , just sit down right here and put your feet in my hands . You 're not gon na look up my dress , are you ? I 'm not going through the rest of my life blind just to sell you shoes . - They 're perfect . I 'll take them . - Fine . That 'll be $500 . Five hundred dollars ? Well , they came in a six-pack . Apparently , they were a family of cats and we were asked not to separate them . But trust me . They were n't killed for shoes . They were all run over by cars . That must be where they get Hush Puppies . Oh , spare me . Just give me the shoes . I 'm tired of looking at myself in your head . Come on , Jefferson , we 're late . And remember , after dinner when they serve the cigars and brandy you go in the other room with the wives . All right , but I better get a phone book for my pants because every time it 's the same thing . The lights " accidentally " go out and I 'm the helpless victim of a gang-goose . Look , those people are important to my career . I need some help . The wind has picked up . Could be disastrous for my hair . You know . Mom . You know what I 'm thinking ? That we should go upstairs and split up Marcie 's shoes ? No , I was just wondering what I was thinking , because I forgot . Hi , Dad . - This is Petal . - It 's part of a flower . Is n't she great ? I met her in Quantum Physics . Hold my calls . There never are any , son . Never mind that now , Dad . See you tomorrow . Young lady ! Young lady , you do realize that 's my son 's bedroom you 're going to ? Yes . Hey , nice shoes . Dad , do n't . Come on , Dad . Dad , no . Come on , Bud . Get over it . What is one girl in the grand scheme of your life ? Just your only chance . And neither has Mom . And lately , neither has your father . Family . Bask in the glory . I did it . I won the contest . You 're looking at the shoe salesman of the month . I 'm going to Hawaii . First class . And you know what they have in first class ? Unlimited peanuts . And a passenger-lavatory ratio of only six to one . Gee , I 'm gon na miss you guys . Well , hang onto your haemorrhoids , honey . I have news for you . I called the airlines and there 's been a change of plans . I traded your first-class ticket in for four standbys . We 're all going to Hawaii together . And , Dad it was my idea . Oh , that was so smart . Well , standby is n't too bad . I mean , how long can they possibly make us wait ? Well , I checked on Seven . Marcie found him where we left him . In her guest room . - Well , what about Buck ? - Oh , I took care of that . I opened up six cans of dog food and I told him to only eat one each day . And I could tell by the way he dug into that first can that he understood completely . Some man or men are gon na be very lucky to have you one day . Attention , ladies and gentlemen . In the first-class lounge the champagne is now 42 degrees . And , as always , unlimited peanuts are now being served . First class . Champagne . Peanuts flowing like wine . That was supposed to be me . Welcome to the first-class lounge . May I see your ticket , sir ? This is standby . You embarrass me and yourself . - Excuse me . - Hey . It 's John Sebastian . Believe in magic , buddy . I seem to have lost my ticket . Oh , it does n't matter , Mr . Sebastian . Life is good . I should have said I lost my ticket . Would n't have done any good . You 're not a rock star . Oh , Richie Havens . Welcome , sir . Spencer Davis . Good to see you . Robby Krieger . I love the Doors . - Mark Lindsay , always a pleasure . - Thank you . Peter Noone . Please come in . Hey , man . Groovy there . Right on . Peace , love and women should n't have to cook , man . Dig it , I 'm hip . Try to keep the groupies off me if you can . Excuse me , excuse me . - Ticket , please . - Well must 've left it in the limo . Rock ' n ' roll always forgets . I 'm sorry , sir , but I do n't recognize you . You 'll need a ticket . Sebastian . John , my man . Come here . Axle . Axle Bundy . You know , from- From Shoes and Socks , remember ? San Francisco , 1969 . I do n't remember too much about 1969 . Who does ? But seriously , you must remember me from the big concert last year . Live Aid . Lemonade . Kool-Aid , Ice Capade . One of those . Yeah , I remember . Peter , look who 's here . Who 's he ? Axle Bundy ? Oh , Axle , great . Hey , I 'm a big fan . I 've got one of your records . You remember the one that sold . Have you still got that tambourine-playing wife in your band ? Still screeches horrible backup vocals . Hey , you must be-Just call me yours . Yeah , and we 're Bombshell and Troll . Hey , fab . Hey , come on in . Unlimited peanuts for all in here . Hey , you got something on your tie-Sandwiches . Could you imagine living like this all the time ? No wonder Fergie 's such a piglet . Speaking of geezers son , have you seen your mother ? No , but if she 's anywhere on this stewardess , I 'll find her . You are who I think of when I have sex with my husband . You are who I think of when I have sex with my husband . You are who I think of when I have sex with my husband . You are who I think of when I-When I clean up the floor around the toilet . Hey , Axle , come on and join us over here . We 're jamming . Yeah , come on , man . It would n't be a jam without ... Who is that guy ? The name 's Awful Grungy or something . I do n't - I do n't know him . But I know that 's Peggy , and I believe we all remember her . I think I remember him . Oh , I do n't know . - Hey , fellow rock bros . - Hey . - I just had me a groupie . - All right . Hey , why do n't you jam with us . Come on , Al , for old time 's sake . Hey , man , where 'd you learn to play pastrami like that ? A little after-hours deli on the South Side . Wild , man .

@@5221341 What are you doing ? Well , I 'm gardening . What are you doing ? I 'm gardening . What are you doing ? Why do n't you come over here and see , honey , since you seem so confused ? Oh , my God . You are gardening . Yeah . Hello . I am gardening . Why ? Because Babette bought me a bag of bulbs . Why would she do that ? She thought that cultivating new life would help distract me from my current emptiness and sense of loss . Well , that 's weirdly sweet of her . Yes , it was . Anyhow , I forgot about the bulbs ' til Babette brought them up this morning , so I dug them out of the garage . Where they 've developed some sort of mold . - This is the planet of the mold . - Help me . Mom , I 'm no botanist , but I do n't think anything 's gon na grow from this piece of tar . Just put it in the hole and cover it up . Just tending my bulbs . - Makes you feel better , does n't it ? - Absolutely , much better . - You need any help ? - Oh , no . I got Rory helping me . - Hi , Babette . - Hi , sugar . - Do n't worry , I 'm looking out for your mom . - I 'm glad to hear that . Oh , and just you wait ' til spring . You 're gon na wake up one morning , walk out , and pow , color coming out of your yin-yang ! I 'll see you girls tomorrow . I 'm going to have color coming out of my yin-yang . Well , then maybe you 'll finally get a man . This has got to be the grossest thing ever . Forget about the bulbs . Let 's talk about something else . How 's school ? School 's fine . It 's hard but good . Tanna 's fine . Oh , my God ! You bulbed me ! You bulbed me ! - I was aiming over there . - Oh , it got my hand ! It got my hand ! - Shake it off . Shake it off . - Oh , it wo n't go ! It wo n't go ! You wiped it on my shirt . It was a reflex . - To ruin my shirt ? - I 'm sorry . - You never liked this shirt . - It 's not that . It 's just that ... - There 's something crawling up my leg ! - Oh no , oh no ! I got it , I got it . - There 's something crawling up my leg ! - I got it , I got it ! It 's big ! Okay , so the next time that Babette gives you a bag of bulbs to plant because you 're lonely , you say ... - No , thank you . - Why ? - Because it smells like a locker room in here ! - Tough luck ! Fine ! - Did the alarm go off ? - I shut it off . Who needs an alarm when you 've got Workout Barbie around ? Never mind that some of us were up finishing a chem lab ' til 2:30 in the morning ! I for one love waking up at five a.m . to the sound of someone grunting out crunches in the common room ! I told you - earplugs . You know , she talks to herself when she stretches . " Come on , Janet . Push it , Janet . Love the pain , Janet . " - It 's pornographic . - What time is it ? I know what she 's doing . It 's psychological warfare . Do n't let your enemy sleep . Push him ' til he cracks . I know . It 's Tuesday , too . That 's waffle bar day . Why did n't you wake me ? Oh , sure , blame me . I 'm the victim here , remember ? Excuse me , excuse me . Can I ... Yes , thank you . - Rory . - Marty . You remembered . Well , I was n't the one passed out in the hallway , so I had a better shot . True , very true . So , I see you 're a little late for breakfast . Yeah . My alarm was turned off . Hey , you want some eggs or something ? I always take enough for ten . I blame my brother . - He always took the biggest piece of chicken . - And left you none ? No , there was plenty more . I just really wanted that big piece . Oh . Well ... - Hey , I want you to meet The Breakfast Crew . I mean , it 's not like an official club or anything . There 's no hats . At least not until we can all agree on a color . Excuse me , guys . I want you all to meet Rory . - Who ? - The robe . - Oh , the robe . Nice to meet you . - I told them about your act of kindness . - Oh , it was nothing , really . - I would n't say that . That was one nice robe . - We all took turns trying it on . - Not true . Ignore him . - I 'm sorry I have n't gotten it back to you yet . - Oh , it 's okay . - Nice bunny shoes . - Thank you . It was nice meeting you all . I actually have to go , so ... - I embarrassed you . - It 's fine . I 'm sorry . But then when I saw you show up this morning like that , I thought , here 's my chance to even the playing field . Marty , this is not as embarrassing as being totally naked . No , it 's not . But it 's close Well , consider the playing field leveled . Good . See ya , Rory . See ya , Marty . Exactly , yes , that 's just the kind of thing we 're looking for . Well , I 'm so glad to hear that because the last three designers we met with had very different philosophies . No , I did n't know you did the Silver Thatch Inn . Oh , that was so beautiful . Yeah . Okay . Well , why do n't we meet Friday , say , around two o'clock ? Okay . Luke 's Diner . It 's right in the middle of the town square . Bye-bye . - What was that ? - I was taking it outside . Three people came in while you held the door open . - You 're exaggerating . - Why ca n't you respect the rules of my diner ? I do respect the rules of your diner . It 's that baseball cap I have issues with . All right , I 've done extensive research , checked references , and prescreened three other designers for you . Here are their names . Well , hopefully I wo n't need these . I think I just found a new designer for the inn . Well , good . I love doing research just for the sake of doing research . I live to grow . Are you still buying me lunch ? I 'd be happy to buy you lunch , but I should probably take you somewhere else . Why should you take him somewhere else ? Because , Kook Danes , Michel eats a very specific diet . Normally , yes , that 's true . - Talk to me about your chocolate cake . - What do you want to know ? - Is it Mexican ? - Is what Mexican ? - The chocolate . - How would I know ? It would say so on the wrapper . You could go look . I 'll wait . Take him somewhere else . Oh , just bring me a doughnut , but put some sprinkles on it , okay ? Do you know what one of life 's great mysteries is ? Whether or not you 're going to be joining us for Friday night dinner . Lorelai , you know very well our dinners do not work like that . There is careful planning and shopping and preparation that goes into every meal no matter how boring and simple it may seem to you . Oh , Mom ... Hey , what ... - Get off that phone ! - Oh , shoot , Mom , there 's no cell phones in here . I 'll call you back later . Bye . And when I need you - nowhere . It 's obvious Hemingway is just using Jake 's impotence to indict a society which exploited its underclass to fight in the trenches of the first World War . Interesting theory , Heather . What does everyone else think ? I do n't know . I mean , is n't Jake 's impotence more about that generation 's loss of faith in love ? Please . That grossly ignores the social context . Rory 's right . The book 's about a guy who ca n't sleep with the woman he loves . We 're out of time . Okay , everyone , we 'll continue this Thursday . I 'll see you all then . - Thanks for the save . - No problem . Heather can get a little " workers of the world , unite " sometimes . Yeah , I 've never actually met someone who likes the word bourgeois so much . So , what are you up to this weekend ? Oh , studying . Sleep , hopefully . A rarity in my dorm room . - Yeah ? Do you eat ? - Habitually . Ever been to Pancia di Lucca ? I hear it 's good . No , I haven't . - I was thinking of going there this weekend . - Oh , cool . Tell me how it is . Okay , I will . Or , hey , you could come with me . I ca n't this Saturday , but if it 's good , maybe another time , okay ? Sure , okay . So , see you next week . Bye , Trevor . - Where ? - Anywhere . The floor , the top of another dirty washing machine . My Belle and Sebastian t-shirt was in the garbage . So now , on top of a massive amount of reading and studying , I get to rewash my formerly perfect clean clothes . Well , that 's just wrong . I think you should quit school in protest . Okay , if you say so . Oh , no , wait . That 's not ours . What do you mean it 's not ours ? Who 's it for ? - I 've got five minutes . Where 's the pizza ? - There . - Thanks . Hi , Rory . - Hey , Lane . My mom ordered all the okra in the Western Hemisphere . - She got a great deal and I 'm starving to death . - Swallow . - You want a Coke ? - No , no time for liquids . I have to be home for dinner in four minutes . Another piece , please ? Great . Okay , this is good . You all look good . Things are good ? - Things are ... - Okay , got ta go . Thanks for the grub . - She is so throwing up on the way home . - I 'm gon na go put this stuff in the washer . Wait , have some pizza and tell Mama all about your day . Okay . Oh , yesterday Janet woke up to find that Paris had chaired her in her room . Oh , nice . And then , later , when Janet had climbed out the window , she retaliated by gluing shut the opening of Paris ' glue gun . - Wow , she went for the crafts . - This war is getting totally out of hand . - Naked guy . - It was totally humiliating . Humiliating ' cause naked guy 's hot ? It was humiliating because I had terrycloth rabbits on my feet . So naked guy 's not hot ? Naked guy is Marty , and it 's not like that . He 's sweet . Sweet means bad butt . Sweet does not mean bad butt . Sweet means sweet . Poor naked guy . He should 've left his clothes on . Okay , you have got to stop talking about naked guy . I just met Marty . All right . If not him , are there any other guys on the horizon ? Nope . No ? How about a professor - someone older , wiser , - with brown cords and whiskey breath ? - Oh , well , yeah . There 's one of those . Come on , Rory . - You do n't like him ? No , I like him fine . I mean , he 's smart , and he takes my side in the debates , and he 's decent to look at . So , why 'd you say no ? Too many clothes ? I do n't know . He ... he carries a bottle of water around with him all the time . - That 's just weird . - Right . Hydration . Very creepy . And he 's preppy , and I do n't really like preppy . Plus , he 's gon na go study in Barcelona next year . - So ? - So it 's a waste of time . It ca n't go anywhere . - It could go to dinner , maybe a movie . - Mom ... No , look , Rory , I know you 've never really dated . What are you talking about ? I 've dated . - Who did you date ? - Dean . - Was relationship number two . So maybe I 've never dated , but you have n't either . I have dated at least once . - You had me with dad - relationship . - Yes , but ... Max - relationship . Dad again - relationship . Okay , fine , I may not be the world 's best dater , but I do it and you should give it a shot . I mean , you 're in college now . What else is there to do in college but date ? I 'm gon na go wash my clothes now . Wait . Was that it ? Is this conversation over ? Sorry , did I win ? - Here , I wanted to show you this . - Castles of Ireland ? There is a room in here that I 've always wanted to do . Here it is . Oh , I love that . What is that wall treatment ? - That 's anaglypta wallpaper . - What are you doing ? I 'm looking at anaglypta wallpaper . Luke , this is Natalie Zimmerman . Natalie 's gon na help us design the Dragonfly . - Nice to meet you . - Did I tell you we 're gon na have horses ? The property already has stables , so why not ? I love horses . I 've always loved horses ever since I was a little girl , and now I finally have a grown-up excuse to buy a pony . Great . Listen , National Velvet , you have to move this stuff out of here . - Why ? - Because this is a diner . People wan na sit . - This is business . - No , this is business , and it 's open , and it 's decorated , and it wants its seats back . Fine . Sorry about that . He 's trying to steal the " World 's Grumpiest Diner Guy " title from Mel . No problem . That sounds interesting . You know , Emily actually has some in the smaller upstairs guest bath . You should take a look at it the next time you 're there . - Emily ? You mean like my mother , Emily ? - Yes . - I did n't know you knew Emily . - Oh , yeah . I did her second-floor remodel about a year ago . I thought that 's how you got my name . Oh , no , I got your name from a magazine . - So you know Emily ? - It 's a small world , is n't it ? Yes , yes , really small . About the same square footage as that box they threw McCain in . So , are you ready to see bedrooms ? Yes , sure . I ca n't believe we sit around and talk about books and get graded on it . I mean , there 's almost nothing I like more than talking about a good book or a bad book or a really thick magazine . Hey , Trevor . You know what else I like to do besides talk about a really good book ? Eat . Is n't that weird ? And , actually , for me , they 're linked . It 's true . When I talk about a book , I get really hungry - starving . - You ever experience that ? - Not really . Oh . Well , it happens to me all the time . Like right now , for example , starving , really . And I enjoyed " The Snows of Kilimanjaro " so much that I will probably be hungry for quite some time . All weekend , probably . Especially Saturday night . - Saturday night ? - Saturday night . Well , that fact has been pretty well established . Okay . Sure . Yeah , let 's go to dinner Saturday night . - So , you 're at ... - Durfee , suite 5 . - I 'll pick you up at 7:30 . - Sounds good . Okay . I got ta hand it to you there , Trevor . You sure are persistent . - Davey ? You 're naming him Davey ? - Yes . - I love Davey . - Me , too . Oh , I ca n't believe you finally picked a name . It makes it real . Yes , because the stomach and massive ankles were too ambiguous . Does Jackson like it ? Well , he 's okay with the stomach , but the massive ankles freak him out . The name Davey . - It was actually his suggestion . - Really ? He wanted Davey if it was a boy and Colgate if it was a girl . - Colgate ? - His great-grandmother 's name . Great-grandmother Colgate . Well , at least you know it 's gon na be a boy . Yes , but he does n't know it 's going to be a boy . And I realized he has to know that I thought Colgate was an insane name , but if I did n't fight him on it , it must be because I knew we were n't gon na have a girl and then he would know we were gon na have a boy , and that would spoil everything for him . So I told him , " We are not naming our daughter after a toothpaste ! " We got in a big fight and we 're not talking . - Cool ! - Yeah , I know . Everything 's perfect . My baby has a name and my husband 's sleeping on the couch . Oh , and I figured out that I 'll go with the Avery stove for the inn . Is that okay ? Because I know it 's a little more expensive . - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . - It 's the Avery . It 's too extravagant . - No , the Avery 's fine . Everything 's fine . - You 're sure ? - I 'm sure . - Just ... Natalie knows my mother . - Emily ? How ? Yes , because she did her second-floor remodel like a year ago . Oh , so she really knows your mother . They 've been shopping together . It 's a bond . - Sookie , I do n't know if I ... - Lorelai , no . - She knows my mother . - So what ? Sookie , my whole life , my whole existence , my essence , my being , my ability to be this sparkling creature standing here before you - - all of this depends on the complete and total separation of my life from my mother 's life . That 's how it works . - But we like Natalie . - We do like Natalie . - Or the purple , purple , purple guy . - Purple , purple , purple . - They were horrible . And then we met Natalie , and she was perfect . Look , just try . At least give Natalie a chance , okay ? Please ? - I 'll try . - Good . I 'm gon na go home and get going on the Avery . All right . I have to stop by Luke 's . I 'll call you later . - Okay . It 's going to be fine . - Yes , it is . Hey , Luke . What 's going on ? Oh , well ... Tom called . The banister on the stairs has to be replaced . It 'll be $4,000 . Tamsin Cordally called . He needs a deposit on the quartersawn oak . It 'll be $4,000 . Julio the landscaper called . Vicki from Vicki 's Horse Supply called . She thinks Pepper and Gunsmoke would suit your needs , but Gunsmoke snores , so the stables ca n't be too close to the guests ' bedrooms . Rory 's looking for her black Converse , and , oh , one last thing - - I 'm not taking messages for you anymore ! - Sorry . - What did you do , have business cards printed up ? - People just know I 'm here a lot . I missed a call from my meat guy because I was on the phone discussing Gunsmoke 's deviated septum . I 'm gon na call all these people today and tell them never to call me here again . - You bet you will . - Consider it done . Good . - Just ... - What ? Just one more thing . Did a package arrive for me here today ? - What ? - I 'm sorry . Never mind , never mind . Luke . Sorry . I 'm cutting it kind of close here . Everybody , drop everything . Ed 's cutting it kind of close . - Here 's your tickets . - You seem mad . Look , Ed , just go to the game and enjoy it , okay ? - Choke on a hot dog while you 're at it . - I have to tell you , Luke , I am never accepting anything free from you again . What a threat ! Boy , you 're a real master of fear , there , Ed . Look out , Jason and Freddy . Ed may never mooch off of either one of you ever again ! - What is wrong with you ? - Nothing . - You 're yelling at Ed . - Ah , Ed bugs me . - Ed cries . - I 'm just having a bad day . Excuse me ? Days . You 've been stomping around , barking at people for days . - I have not . - Yes , Cujo , you have . - Really , Lassie ? Why is that ? Look , I bought these tickets for Nicole ' cause she 's a Yankees fan . I thought it 'd be nice if we went to a game together . - Oh , man . - And it 's no big deal . I mean , the closer it got to the game , the more I felt like a loser . I mean , I 'm sitting on these tickets , which means I thought I 'd still be in a relationship . I do n't know . Stupid . I broke my own rule . I asked for it . What are you talking about ? Never plan for anything more than two days in advance . That 's your rule ? Yes , ' cause when you make plans , then you have expectations , and when you have expectations , then you will get disappointed . Having expectations also gives you something to look forward to . Yes , then you 're looking forward to being constantly disappointed . Hey , I have an idea . - Tomorrow night is usually movie night . - What ? Rory and I would always rent a bunch of movies , order food - - it was our thing . Now she 's at school and busy , so why do n't you come over ? It might be fun . - Okay . - Yeah ? - Sure , what else have I got to do ? - Ah , I love when men say that to me . What time ? - Eight . - Eight it is . I 'll stop by the video store and pick us up a couple movies . What do you want to see ? I do n't know . Come on , tell me . I do n't want to get something you 've seen . Do n't worry about it . I have n't seen anything . - People always say that . - Well , with me , it 's true . - " Casablanca " ? - Nope . - " Bonnie and Clyde " ? - A video game would be nice also . " It Happened One Night " ? " His Girl Friday " ? " Treasure of the Sierra Madre " ? " Diner " ? I saw " Mr . and Mrs . Bridge . " Oh . My house , eight o'clock . We have such work to do . I 'll see you there . Oh , by the way , if my package arrives today , bring it with you , okay ? Thanks . Hold on , whoa . Wow , that could have been very ugly , huh ? The great cappuccino disaster of 2003 . Very sad - - Shelley Winters drowns . Think the coffee was stronger than I thought . - Can I take your coat ? - Thank you . Your daughter called and said she was gon na be late . Her class ran long . Could I - just - it 's new . I ca n't be away from it just yet . Oh , thanks . Okay . Back in a flash . What are you doing ? I was looking for my lip gloss . You need the radio on to look for your lip gloss ? Well , I came out here and I could n't find it and so I thought maybe if I tried to retrace my steps , it would turn up . - Very clever idea . - Yeah , I thought so . So I put my purse on the seat and I put the keys in the car , and naturally the radio came on ' cause that 's what it does , and , " Shadow Dancing " was playing , which was one of my all time favorite songs in junior high . - And you forgot to look for your lip gloss . - Just for a second . Look at that . Yes , it 's a miracle . Come inside , Lorelai . Well , ca n't I just wait ' til the song ... I 'm coming . You ca n't sit here for three seconds without Rory . Not true . Oh , stop it and sit down . I want to talk to you about something . I just found out that Sookie is pregnant . Do n't look at me , I had nothing to do with it . - May I ask why you did n't bother to tell me ? - Well ... Lorelai , your not telling me about Sookie is unforgivable . - Why , it 's not like you 're such good friends . - I went to her wedding . So did Kirk . I have n't sent her a gift , Lorelai . How does that make me look ? Like you hate her and all childbearing women . You are so intent on keeping me out of your life . It 's not even my life . It 's Sookie 's life . How did you find out about it , anyway ? Why , are you going to track down the informant and have him shot ? Maybe . It does n't matter how I found out . I found out , no thanks to you . Mom , please , just tell me how you found out . Why ? Does it bother you not knowing ? - Yes . - Me , too . - Rory , you 're here . - I 'm so sorry I 'm late , Grandma . - Hi , Mom . - You 'll pay . So come on , sit down and tell me all about Yale . If you do n't , she 'll find out anyway . Yale 's interesting . It 's a lot more free-form than I thought . Well , you 're an adult now . They treat you like an adult in college . In college , yes . In the Gilmore house ... We 've switched subjects , in case you were wondering . - I 'm actually going on a date . - You are ? - Well , your first college date . - Who 's the lucky guy ? - Just a guy from my English class . - No . - Your English class . - What happened ? - I thought you turned him down . - You turned him down ? I know , but I thought about it and I reconsidered . What did you do ? Did you ask him out ? You asked him out ? Oh , Rory , tell me you did n't ask a boy out . I did n't ask him out . I just made sure he knew I was available . - Better , Mom ? - No , that 's not better . Rory , you 're in Yale , not Amsterdam . How you conduct yourself socially is as important as how you conduct yourself academically . I promise , it was very proper . - What are you gon na wear ? - I do n't know . Do you want to borrow something of mine ? - No , she does not . - What does that mean ? It 's bad enough that you have n't taught your daughter how to interact with the opposite sex . You will not dress her up in one of your " Sex and the City " ensembles and send her out to tell the entire campus , " Do n't worry . I 'll ask you . " How do you know about " Sex and the City " ? Okay , see , something like this outside against a wall - very " Little House on the Prairie " with a twist . I love " Little House on the Prairie . " Jack the dog . I 'm not really sure . Okay . Well , just keep in mind that anything you see here I can have duplicated . I 've got this guy in Delaware that can knock off anything for about half the price . Maybe we should go . What ? We just got started . Well , maybe we should think a little more before we shop . What are you talking about ? We 've been thinking for months . Let 's start buying ! Holy mother of God , this bench is $15,000 . We can find something else . - Oh , no , we do n't have to find something else . - What are you talking about ? We have absolutely no problem paying full price for that bench . - What ? - Yeah . No money problems or problems of any kind . Our entire lives are perfect . We have no complaints and plenty of money . I 'll be back . - We can not afford that bench . - Oh , I know that . I do n't want her to know that . - Her - Natalie , her ? - Yes . - Why ? - Because it could get back to my mother . - What could get back to your mother ? - That we have money problems . We do have money problems . I know , but I do n't want my mother knowing that we have money problems . I do n't want any personal information leaked out because in Emily 's hands , - that could be a weapon . - Well , Natalie 's not gon na say anything . How do you know ? How do you know she 's not filling my mother in - on our every move on a daily basis ? - You 're being paranoid . Oh , yeah ? My mother found out about you being pregnant . - Not from Natalie . This is getting crazy now . You have got to go out there and talk to her about this . - I do n't know . - It 's the only fair thing . Come on . Go . Hey , look , Natalie , I have to say something to you . I feel a tad silly even mentioning it , but I think I have to . - Did I do something that ... - No , you did nothing . You 've been great , really . Great ideas , great attitude . - It 's just that ... you know my mother . - Yes ? That 's it . You know my mother . And my mother and I do n't exactly have the smoothest of relationships . Right . I mean , we 're not warring or anything , but it 's just that we 're very different , and I feel kind of weird sharing things with her . Look , I promise you , I have n't been in contact with your mother for a long time . I had n't even met you yet . So trust me - - she knows nothing that you have n't told her yourself . Oh . Okay . I feel really stupid right now . No , do n't . I enjoyed working with your mother , but this inn is the kid of thing that I love to do . And the place has incredible potential and somebody 's gon na get a chance to make it a wonderful inn . I would be heartsick if I lost this opportunity . Look , I have n't spoken to Emily in months . I doubt I 'll be speaking to her in the future . I promise . - Okay . - Really ? - Absolutely . - I 'm so glad . So am I . So now that I talked myself back into a job , what do you think the outlook for this lawn jockey is ? Not good . - Emily would hate it . - Wrap it up . Okay , so this is option number four . - Okay . Sorry . Start again . What do you think ? Men respond subconsciously to a woman 's pheromones . You should run in place ' til he gets here . It 'll give you a nice musk . Go back to your leg . Roommates meeting starts in two minutes . Hey , I told you to stop with the math and the Sharpies on my good sheets . Okay . Sorry . - How come the puppy does n't pee on your bed ? - I 'll be right out , Paris . Hurry up . All right , everyone , take a seat , please . Rory , one last curtsy , and let 's move . My date will be here in ten minutes , so talk fast . Thank you all for coming . Now , I 'd like to start this meeting by saying that no one here is on trial . This meeting is about healing , it is about redemption , it is about accepting responsibility and making amends . I do n't believe this . Hey , since I 'm already standing , why do n't I start ? This is thrilling . Setting your alarm for 5:30 in the morning when no one else here shares the desire to put on nylon shorts and run in circles for an hour like a greyhound is selfish . I have a partial athletic scholarship , Paris . The grunting and the sweating , and there are plastic balls everywhere . - One balance ball . - No one can sleep . No one can breathe . Rory missed breakfast the other day . You 've seen Rory eat . She can not miss breakfast . Paris has a point there . Excuse me , but if I remember correctly , Rory missed breakfast because you turned her alarm off . Janet does have a point there . And while we 're airing grievances , what about your stupid craft area ? Everywhere you turn , there 's glitter or seashells or macaroni . - And the smell of the glue . The coasters I make are for everyone . Those push-ups are for you and you alone . - I vote we get rid of craft corner . - No , that 's my emotional homework ! Okay , let 's just all calm down for a sec . No . I can not calm down . I have tried to be reasonable . I have told myself over and over , " God , look at her . Imagine what she 's been through to make her turn out like that . " - A lot ! - But you 're impossible ! And frankly , I 'm just sick of your constant negativity ! You 're on steroids , are n't you ? That 's what 's behind this obsessive behavior . You 're calling me obsessive ? - I am not intimidated or afraid of you . - Hi . You ready to go ? Just one sec . We 're finishing up a roommates meeting . - I 'll race you . - What ? To Hewitt Quad and back . - Forget it . I am not gon na race ... - On your mark , get set , go . Now they 're gon na have a nice musk . - Shall we ? - After you . Ah , man bearing bags of food . Come in . - I went a little overboard here . - No such thing . I got tons of fries , half a pumpkin pie . You got whipped cream here ? Always . And , I was n't sure what to do with the burgers because sometimes you order with double cheese , sometimes you do n't , so I brought one with normal cheese and one with ... - What did you do ? - I ordered food . I said I 'd bring food . So I ca n't contribute , like I 'm a piker ? No . Just that I did n't need to bring food . I 'm leftover girl . I 'll have the burgers tonight and the Chinese food during the week . I do n't like fresh Chinese food . I like stale Chinese food . I give up . - I got you a nice , cold beer . - Appreciate it . You are one click away from " Casablanca . " Start it up . No , whoa . We need to get situated . Are you all situated ? - I 'm situated . - You need to , like , squish around a little . - I do n't need to . - Come on , squish around a little bit . I 'm fine how I am . Okay , but , you ca n't squish during the movie because it 's distracting . That 's rule number one . There 's rules ? Oh , yeah , especially for a true classic like " Casablanca . " It 's not like we 're watching a there's-nothing-else-on movie or a guilty pleasure like " Hardbodies . " Oh , my God . Have you seen " Hardbodies " ? I do n't think so .k.a . " Hardbodies . " - Let 's see that . - No , Luke , we 're seeing " Casablanca . " - Then let 's see that . - Okay , the rest of the rules - no talking during the movie . No exceptions during a true classic . And minimize distraction . You know , no shifting around a lot , no phone calls , nothing . No going to the bathroom . If you go , you miss the movie ' cause we 're not pausing the movie . That 's the only way to get the flow of the thing , okay ? - Fair enough . - Okay . Here we go . What 's that ? Okay ... A , no talking during the movie , and B , do n't tell me you 've never seen the FBI warning before . It 's new to me . Oh , my God . You 're beyond monk . You 're uber-monk . Just start it up . I wo n't talk again . Now , Luke , the train is not going to leave the screen . - Hit the button . - Okay . Hang onto this . We 'll page you when the table 's ready . Thank you . A riot of color . Geeky but cool . Ever been to Italy ? No . Yes . What am I saying ? Yes . I was just there . Duh . Hard thing to forget . Yeah . I 'm just so used to not having been anywhere , but yeah , I have . And what 's it like ? Terrific . Boy , they have these places all over . Two in Miami , Detroit . Hey , two in my hometown . - Now , that 's a great town . - Definitely . So you 've been there ? - Where ? - Chicago . Oh , no . You know , I miss things about home that I did n't think I 'd miss . Like my little brother Brian . He drove me crazy my whole life , and now I ca n't wait for his e-mails . You have any siblings ? No . You know , I read this article once about restaurants like this where they have an open bowl of mints that you grab on your way out . And when people come out of the bathroom , a lot of them do n't wash their hands . They 'll grab a mint and walk out , and people have studied the mints and they found traces of urine in them , so they 're urine mints . - Hey , we 're being paged . - Good . Right this way . - Thank you . - Enjoy . - Stop doing that . - Shh , no talking . - Then stop doing that . - Doing what ? Looking at me . Vain party , table for one . It 's creepy . I enjoy watching people watch certain parts of certain movies . But you look over just before something big happens , so I always know something 's coming . Oh , I do ? You did it just before Humphrey Bogart saw Ingrid Bergman for the first time . Well , she 's the costar . You knew something was coming . - There goes our flow . - Well , we missed stuff while we were talking . - Hi , it 's Lorelai . Leave me a message . - You 're back too far , we 've seen this . - I did n't . I was looking at you . - We 'll never get through this . Mom , are you there ? - Oh , wait , wait . - Come on . Mom , if you 're there , pick up . - Honey , are you okay ? - There goes the phone rule . - No , this whole night is sucking . I 've never had this feeling before . Sort of frozen , sort of unsure , sort of wishing you 'd read a lot of dating articles in preparation ? I have no idea what I 'm doing here , and everyone is staring at me - because they know we 're on a bad first date . - Oh , so the guy 's a dud ? Trevor 's fine . I 'm moronic . I bring the conversation to a crashing halt every time I speak . Well , where is he now ? In the bathroom , probably pondering my brilliant anecdote about urine mints . About what ? You know , when people go to the bathroom and they do n't wash their hands and they come out and they take a mint . Oh , my God . I 've been eating those mints for years . We keep bumping menus , and my neck already hurts from trying to turn and look at him when he talks . Can I tell him to sit on the other side ? Honey , you just ... you have to relax , ' cause it 's just a date , and sometimes dates do n't go well . I mean , I 'm sorry I ca n't be of more help , but if he comes back and you 're on the phone , it might make things more awkward . - Bite the bullet , huh ? - Yeah . Sorry , but yeah . - Okay . I 'll talk to you later . - Bye . - Oh , poor thing . - Dating 's the worst . Yeah , but they 're sitting on the same side of the table and that 's awkward , and she ca n't think of what to say next , and you know , she 's just got ta go through it and figure it out on her own . She could say there 's a draft . - What ? - Where she 's sitting . She could say the air conditioning is hitting her , switch to the other side , - and just blame it on that . - That 's perfect . - Mom ? - Hey . Is he back yet ? Say there 's a draft and move to the other side of the table . It 's very ladylike to feel drafts . He 'll totally understand . Okay , good . And then ask what his brother and sister 's names are . - He 'll like that you cared enough to confirm . - Yeah , that seems right . Do n't worry about the conversation . Just talk , and if the talk does n't flow , it does n't . And stay away from urine-related topics , and you 're good to go . - Thanks , Mom . - Oh , the draft thing was Luke's . - Well , thank him for me , too . I 'd better go . She says thanks . I would n't trade places with her for the world . Really ? You would n't want to go out with a boy named Trevor ? - You might want to wait and see his picture . - I mean dating . It 's a horror . It 's the only cure for the singleness thing , barring ordering a spouse off the internet . - I missed nothing by not dating . - Not true . If I had dated a lot , I 'd still be single . I 'd just have spent a lot of bad nights at Tony Roma 's . Yeah , but dating is how you get to know your potential partner . It 's the only way . There 's the gut . I can tell if I 'm comfortable with someone within seconds of meeting them . I feel it here . I felt it with Rachel . I felt it with Nicole . - I was immediately relaxed . - You 've got the gut thing . - Aah ! You 're fast-forwarding . We 'll not gon na get through this thing . I just wan na get to the good parts . There are no bad parts of " Casablanca . " Just go back . Back . I 'm gon na go grab dessert . Hey , phone again . - Hello ? - Who is this ? - Who 's this ? - This is Emily Gilmore . - Who 's this ? - Luke Danes , Mrs . Gilmore . Your daughter 's friend from the diner . I 'm not really supposed to be talking to you here . Hang on . - Why did you answer the phone ? - You answered it before . Yeah , but that was Rory . You should have told her I 'm not here . - Then what would I be doing here ? - Light maintenance . - Come on , take it . - You broke a rule . You 've broken every rule . What 's up ? So now you 're telling people they ca n't speak to me ? No , Mom . It 's just a little movie-night rule . If you and Luke wan na talk , you guys can talk . - I 'm talking about Natalie Zimmerman . - Natalie ? I called her today about sprucing up a room she did for me a year ago , and , as you would say , she blew me off . Well , what did she say ? She said she could n't help me out , but she would n't say why , so I leaned on her a bit . She cracked and said she 'd made you certain promises . Mom , I never told her she could n't work for you . She said you did . - Well , no . Our agreement was ... - So there was an agreement . - Yes , but ... - To exclude me ? No . Well , not exactly . So far I know there 's Natalie and Sookie and Luke on movie night . What about Richard ? Am I still allowed to talk to my husband ? Mom , this is just a big misunderstanding . Go ahead and hire Natalie . But you 'll still have a problem with both of us using her . I will cease working with her . She 's all yours . I 'll tell her tomorrow . Oh , wonderful . So it 'll be my fault she loses the job . No , Lorelai , you keep her , and I promise I 'll never speak to her - ever . If she 's bleeding on the side of the road , I 'll drive by and pretend I did n't see . - Mom ... - I have to go . I 'm firing Natalie . - That 's up to you . - Consider it done . - I 'll see you Friday . - Yup . I know just how you feel , Rick . " He fell asleep during " Hardbodies . " How do you fall asleep during a classic like " Hardbodies " ? There 's no accounting for taste . He looks comfy there , does n't he ? Yeah , he does . So , you wan na talk about it or you wan na forget about it ? Well , there 's nothing much to talk about . It was just bad . I got a little better as the night went on - talked a little more . He was very nice , just not my type . Oh , and the whole draft thing backfired . How so ? Well , I switched over to the other side of the table . Then he started to feel the same draft and came over to my side . - But we made up the draft . - The power of suggestion . - Boys are so malleable . - It just all seemed so forced . Luke thinks it 's all about gut instinct - you know instantly if a person is right for you . I think you have to go through a lot to find a contender . And you 've been very lucky with boys before . They were just always sort of there , but I think for the most part , - a girl 's got to hunt a little . - And go through a lot of non-contenders . Yes , then the non-contenders become your fun bad-date anecdotes . In fact , on your next date , if you 're stuck for a topic , - tell him about your bad date . - But what if that date is bad ? - Then you have an anecdote for your next date . - And how long does this go on ? You 've seen " Grey Gardens . " It could go on forever . - Oh , well , just shoot me now . - Hang in there . Oh , yeah , somebody had already dumped them out , so I put ' em in my basket to keep ' em clean . Hope you do n't mind . No . Thanks . Wow , that 's the coolest laundry basket I 've ever seen . I love The Smiths . I had an older brother that got me into them , and when my friends were listening to Hootie and the Blowfish , I was memorizing " Meat is Murder . " Well , I have a mom who 's pretty much cooler than anyone you 'd meet , - and she did the same thing . - Mine 's a plain old soccer mom , but she 's great . Well , being away like this makes you think about stuff like that , does n't it - home ? Totally . Hey , would you maybe wan na get a cup of coffee sometime , in between classes or something ? I do n't think so , but thanks . You 're welcome . 
@@5221441 When I was 14 , it seemed like all I did was work . I worked at school . " Four score and seven years ago , our forefathers " brought forth from this continent a new nation , " conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal . " I worked at home . Sometimes I even went sleep-working . But the one thing I always did for fun was go to the movies . Man , did you see Purple Rain ? Yes ! " Why do n't you stay a while , see how it 's done ? " Man , did you see Rambo ? Yeah . " Do we get to win this time , sir ? " Man , did you see Beverly Hills Cop ? " Here , why do n't you go ahead and take this banana ? " The one big movie I missed was Ghostbusters . " I got slimed . " " Man , that chick is toast . " Are they still talking about Ghostbusters ? Yeah . It 's only the biggest movie out this year . - Then what are you talking about ? - I thought you saw everything . - I kept missing it . Now the only place it 's still playing is the dollar theater . But popcorn still cost eight bucks . And this is the last week . Maybe we can catch it on Saturday . - It leaves Thursday . - Forget it . We 'll have to see it when it comes out on video in 4 years . Back then , that was quick . I 'm not waiting four years . Class ... I just want to let you know that I wo n't be here tomorrow because I have a funeral to attend . Who died ? My sister . Oh , I 'm sorry . Thank you , Chris . It 's hard because I do n't have 19 or 20 other siblings like you . What 'd she die of ? She died of a bad case of grammar . Watch those prepositions . I ai n't afraid of no ghosts . 2x15 Everybody Hates Cutting School In my neighborhood , most kids ' parents did n't get involved at school , so whenever my mother had the time , she would . I 'm coming up to your school tomorrow to help out with the book fair . Are you going to help at my bookmark table ? I 'll try , baby . When are you coming ? Around 9:00 . Why ? Nothing . No " nothing . " What 's wrong ? Well , I just do n't want you calling me " sweetie " and stuff like that . Last time you came , people made fun of me for a week . Why do n't you just call him Joe Rockhead ? That 's what all my friends call him . That 's ' cause your frien smell like hot toilet bowls . You smell like underarm and booty crack . Hey , stop it . We 're eating . Well , do n't worry , Drew . When can I come up to your school ? Not tomorrow . Not tomorrow . Nothing 's going on , anyway . I was n't asking about tomorrow . Just in general . I know , I 'm just saying that nothing 's going on tomorrow . What , are you embarrassed about me , too ? - No , I 'm not embarrassed . - Then what 's your problem ? - I do n't have a problem . - Then why I ca n't come up ? You can come to the school , just not tomorrow . What 's the big deal about tomorrow ? Nothing - - that 's what I try to tell you . That 's not what I asked you . I know , I just said that tomorrow nothing 's going on . Then why making a federal case out of it ? - I 'm not . - You are . Baby , I thought you did that already . A new license costs 17.50 . And I 'm not giving them people my money until I have to . My father waited until the last possible moment to pay for everything - - and I mean everything . Your meter 's only got a minute left . When that quarter runs out , I 'll put in this one . Baby , you 're almost out of gas . When that gas runs out , I 'll put in some new gas . Push . Push . Julius , would you just pay the man , please ? ! When the baby 's all the way out , I 'll give him all the money . You better get up there early ' cause you know how those lines are . Yeah , I 'm going to be there when the door opens . I 'm going to take my picture , pay my 17. Man , this is going to be so cool . Wait , you never cut school before ? I 've had perfect attendance since kindergarten . Well , listen , if you do n't want to do this , I understand . I would n't want to mess up your record . Nah , it 's cool . Who knew that in the future this one unexplained absence would keep Greg from getting into Harvard ? If we get caught , I can just say it was your fault . Same thing happened to Colin Powell . The only thing I 'm worried about is , what if people miss us ? Like who ? The only person that 'll miss you is me . The only person that 'll miss me is you . Things are n't much different now . What about when they take attendance ? Oh , I got Pedro to cover for us . Meanwhile , my father was there bright and early to beat the line at the DMV . Too late . Well , get in line . This is the line to renew your driver 's license ? No , this is the line for tickets to see Scritti Politti . Yeah , this is the line . Man , all these people . I thought I was gon na be out of here in an hour . Try three . Make that three and a half . While my father was gettinginline , my mother was about to getoutof line . Well , Rochelle , all I need you to do is to help the children pick out a book , and then send them to the front to pay for it . That 's it ? That 's it . I have everything else under control . No , you do n't . I could 've stayed at home for this . Back at school it was lunchtime . Today 's special was " Running Like Hell . " - You ready ? - Ready . All right , now just be cool and keep walking . While we were cutting class , Greg was sweating like Lil Kim in Sunday School . You think they know we 're gone ? The only one that would even notice is Caruso . He can just beat somebody else up . What 's that ? I was up all night packing for everything we might need . I 've got peanut butter sandwiches in case we get hungry , I 've got some wet naps in case we get sticky from the peanut butter sandwiches , I brought a compass in case we get lost , some extra water , Rolaids , aspirin , a traveling toothbrush ... Greg , we 're going to the movies , not Gilligan 's Island . If we did , Greg would have got with Mrs . Howell . Hold on . For my " cutting school " scrapbook . Smile . Greg saw that picture on eBay last week for $500 . Only problem with my mother helping at a book fair was she did n't read books and she was n't fair . Flowers in the Attic . Now that sounds nice . Read that . You done lost your Jackie Collins mind . And do n't cut your eyes at me , either . Boy , do n't you know you are too big for a coloring book ? White kids your age are building sculptures by now and you 're over here trying to stay inside the lines . Come on , Picasso . Get to chipping ' . Come on . Chip on . You should n't be embarrassed that your boy only has a fifth grade reading level . You should be embarrassed that he 's 27 . He should be reading War and Peace , not Horton Hears a Who . Here . Here you go . Hey , baby , how 's it going ? Oh , I 'm sorry , sweetie . I did n't mean to call you " baby . " - Honey , I ... - Mom , just be quiet . Buy some lemonade . It 's good . My baby made it . The line was getting shorter , and so was my father 's patience . What ? ! You 'd think they were married . May I help you ? You got people out here . You ca n't just go to lunch . People have stuff to do . Then why do n't you come back another day ? Because my license expires today . Well , then I guess you 're just gon na have to wait . And do n't bang on this door again . She 's lucky he did n't bang on her head . The weirdest thing about being out of school on a school day was plain and simple : no kids . This feels strange , like everyone 's staring at us . Almost like being a black kid at an all-white school ? Enjoy the show . Two tickets for Ghostbusters , please ? Two dollars ... It 's a black ... holiday . Yeah ? Which one ? Which one ? The Autobiography ... of Miss Jane PittmanDay . Great woman . She was a credit to your race . And Howdy Doody 's a credit to yours . What are you doing here ? I 'm an octoroon . In that case , only one-eighth of him should be off from school . Okay . Enjoy the show . Happy holidays . If I made it past this guy , I would finally get to see Ernie Hudson 's best work . Meanwhile , at the DMV , my father was playing the waiting game , and he was losing . 126 , window " A . " 37 , " D . " 37 , " D . " 42 , window " F . " Number 25 ? Can I help you ? Yes , you can help me . I 'm here to renew my license . Number 127 , window " F . " This license is expired . No , it 's not . It expires today . Yeah , but I been standing in line since 7:45 a . m . Are you one of those people that waits until the last minute to pay ? No , I 'm one of those people who likes to wait until the last four hours and 15 minutes to pay ! Would you like a dime so you can call someone who cares ? I ca n't believe he did n't take the dime . Please , ca n't I just give you my money and go ? Thanks . Right after you take your written test . I 've been driving for over 20 years . I know the rules of the road . My father knew the rules of the road , but they werehisrules . In a construction zone , you speed up . When pedestrians are entering the crosswalk speed up . At a railroad crossing , you really speed up . In the meantime , my mother decided to give Tonya a lesson in making the hard sell . Well , these bookmarks ai n't gon na sell themselves . Especially because you can use any piece of paper for free . If people ai n't coming to the bookmarks , you take the bookmarks to the people - - take that side . Lift it higher , girl . That was a bigger fire hazard than pyrotechnics at a Great White concert . Hey , girl , you got a bookmark ? No , thank you , I do n't need one . Oh , okay , Miss Evelyn Wood . I guess you 're just gon na speed-read through the whole book . And who are you ? Oh , who are you ? With your magic book that just stays open to whatever page you leave it on . Excuse me , I got to go . Girl , you need to go with your cheap behind . You ca n't spend 25 cents on a bookmark ? Did you spend all your money on cookies ? No ! I bought a book . Oh , really ? What 's it about , crushing dreams ? ' Cause that 's exactly what you 're doing . Fine ! I 'll take one . Thank you . Here you go . Bye . Lay off the cookies . I wonder what they 're doing at school . Feeling like suckers . On behalf of the Corleone Junior High students I 'd like to welcome a very special guest -- Earth , Wind Fire ! Yeah , suckers ! Excuse me , can you be quiet ? Ms . Morello ? I thought you were at a funeral . No , stupid - - she 's at yours . Chris , I 'm sorry for sshushing you . I know your people ca n't help talking in the movies . Why are n't you in school ? I wonder if she 'd believe it was Chicken George Day . Well , we just finished lunch , and we figured we 'd get a little popcorn , and ... now we 're on our way back to school . I do n't mean to be disrespectful , but what are you doing here ? - Well , Greg ... - Hey , baby . I got the popcorn . You want Junior Mints or Goobers ? - I got both . - You 're on a date ? Chris , we all grieve in our own way . Grieve ? Who 's grieving ? - Did you go to the funeral , too ? - What funeral ? So you lied about your sister dying ? - Yes . - Your sister died ? - No . - How could you do that ? That 's neither here nor there . The fact is , you should n't be here . Well , I 'm sorry - - I just wanted to see this movie . I did n't think missing one day of school would hurt . You can see a white man in a movie anytime . Sorry . Come on , Greg , let 's go . Chris , wait . - Stay . - Are you serious ? Yes . But do n't you ever let me find out you 've done anything like this again , you understand ? Yes , ma'am . Could you not mention that you saw me here ? Yes , ma'am . Nice meeting you . Enjoy the movie . Back at the DMV , my father was DOA . I 'm sorry , sir , you fail . What do you mean , fail ? Let me see that ! What 's wrong with this one ? Speed limit in a school zone is 25 , not 50 . Not if he 's late . Fine . I 'll do it again . What do you think you 're doing ? I 'm going to take the test . I have to do this again ? ! If you want a license . Good thing she ca n't read minds . 42 ! " It ... " was ... the ... " beast of ... " times . " It ... " was ... the ... " roast ... of times . " I mean , my God , boy , did you eat a bowl of lead paint for breakfast ? Go on and sit down and let one of these other illiterates take a crack at it . Excuse me , can I speak to you for a minute ? Oh , I 'm sorry , is there a problem ? Yes . You . Drive safely . Thank you . Here you go . Oh , you do n't pay me . That 's the line to go pay . 59 ! Hey , baby . Where you been all day ? Getting my license . It was horrible . - What ? - They called the cops and everything . Yeah , we had to beg for them to let her go . Why are you arresting me ? ! You should be arresting these teachers ! Please let my ma go ! Kids at a book fair that ca n't read ! - Oh , get her out of here ! - I should call Jesse Jackson ! Jesse ! What happened ? Those people do n't know how to run a book fair , that 's what happened . Chris , how was your day ? The hardest thing about having such a great day was pretending it never happened . What do you mean ? What do you mean , what do I mean ? It 's a simple question . - I know . - Okay . Okay what ? Did anything interesting happen in school today ? Like what ? Like I do n't know . You were there all day - - that 's why I 'm asking you . Nothing happened . How many times do I have to tell you to hang up your jacket when you come in ? I am standing here with Verdine White of legendary RB group Earth , Wind Fire , who did an impromptu concert today for the lucky kids at Corleone Junior High . Verdine , how was it ? It was really great . But the only sad thing , though , I heard there is a black kid named Chris at the school , but he was n't here . Well , that 's too bad for Chris . Reporting live , I 'm Julie Lancaster at Corleone Junior High . Back to you , Bob , at the studio . So nothing happened in school today , huh ? Who you gon na call ? 
@@5222141 give you that shot a hundred times , you 'll never make it again . Looked like something you 'd do on ice skates . This ai n't hockey , Fraser , okay ? This is basketball . A good American game.Well perhaps it has become Americanized , Ray , but , like many things Americans lay claim to , it originated elsewhere . Get out of here.No , it 's a fact . Basketball was invented by a Canadian . Look , just because some fisherman once slam-dunked a halibut into a net -- Actually , it was a minister who used a soccer ball , and he nailed peach baskets to either end of the gym . Oh this is very sad , Fraser . Of course , Reverend Naismith eventually immigrated to the United States . As a matter of fact , he was working at a YMCA in Springfield , Massachusetts , of all places , when he -- Stop the car . What ? Someone 's parked in a fire zone . So ? Well , for one thing it 's dangerous , and for another it 's disrespectful of the law . Hey , hey ! You 're gon na drive my insurance rates through the roof ! Excuse me , sir . Benton Fraser , Royal Canadian Mounted Police . Perhaps you did n't notice that sign when you parked your car , Oh , is that so ? Yes , and the problem is , you see , if the trucks were to come they would n't have a source for their fire hoses . You do know what you can do with your fire hoses ? Ah , well , yes , if I was unable to circumvent your vehicle , I 'd pull up that sign , drive it through the side windows , and run my hoses in between . But that 's just me.Hah . Leave me alone , jocko . Hey , hey . License and registration , pal . Register this . Tough guys . I think I hit a tire . You all right ? We better get you out of the street . You 'll be okay here . I got ta go . Bye . God , you 're beautiful . Due South 1x11 - You Must Remember This There was this woman.Uh-huh . I just opened my eyes and there she was . The most beautiful woman I ever saw ! Uh-huh.How long was he unconscious ? Four , maybe five minutes . She pulled me to safety , and then she kissed me . Uh-huh.She kissed you ? On the lips . Head injury . It happens . Did she speak to you ? She wanted to stay . I know she did . Then she was gone . She wants me to find her , Fraser . Uh-huh.You want to stop with the uh-huh-ing ? Do you remember what she looked like ? She looked exquisite.Uh-huh . Definite hit-and-run . Skid marks everywhere . Nobody saw the driver . She must have gone that way . What do you mean she ? Well , there was no one else on the street , Ray . You think it was her ? She saved my life ! Well yes , she did . She was driving at night in a strange neighborhood with bad street lighting . Okay , okay , so maybe she was nearsighted . He actually stopped a guy on the south side to lecture him on fire safety ? Well , it 's Saturday night , and he 's Canadian . Good call . Okay , so I ran the plate on that car you brought in last night . Vehicle 's registered to Frank Bodine . 177 West Flournoy , apartment 12 . He 's got 1450 unpaid parking tickets and an expired registration . Any priors ? That 's a different program . This is just vehicular . So Fraser , how 's the apartment furnishing coming along ? Very well , thank you , Elaine . As a matter of fact , I recently purchased a lamp . Really ? A lamp . - Very good for reading . Is that what you do at night ? Elaine , we got work to do here . Bodine , Frank , aka Frank Bimington . Aug . ' 89 , breaking and entering . One year , suspended . March ' 90 , receiving stolen property , got 18 months in Joliet.Did eight . November ' 94 , possession of illegal weapons , case pending . 250,000 bail posted . No wonder he did n't want us running his license . What about the woman ? You know , funny thing , I 'm having a hard time matching the word ' exquisite ' to a lot of mug shots . You want me to authorize a stakeout for a weapons violation ? Assault weapons , sir . A whole trunk full of them . We can put out a APB on this guy , but he 's one nasty piece of work , and I do n't think he 's just coming in for anybody , so naturally I 'm thinking stakeout . Right . I ca n't blame you , Vecchio . Stakeout is such a romantic notion . Oh , it certainly was not . I remember the hotel bill as if it were yesterday . Poolside cabana suites , aquatic aerobic lessons . The suspect liked to swim , sir . The thrill of toting up that four thousand dollar mini-bar tab . Aw , it 's the honey-roasted peanuts , sir . One bag and they got you . Do you ever feed this wolf ? I 'm so terribly sorry , sir , but I think it 's the urban influence . He seems to have developed a real taste for fast food . All right , two teams , two spotters , one apartment , no mini-bar . Thanks , Lieutenant . You do n't get him by Friday , that 's it.Right . If I give him some , will he stop ? Not a chance , sir . Thank you kindly , Leftenant . So how are things at work ? I do n't want to talk about it . We 'll talk about it .Ah come on . I 'm only five minutes late . Five minutes too late , thank you . Hey , Dief , how you doing ? You guys play any cards while we were away ? We were messing around a little . So how many do you want ? Uh , none , thank you . None ? How many ? None . Gim me three . It 's all about signs.Two . Gim me x.What do you mean signs ? Women give you signs to let you know that they 're the right woman for you . She hit you with her car . You call that a sign ? You know , when the French fall in love , they say that they 've been hit by a coup de foudre . - What ? - A bolt of lightning . Love is a very disorienting emotion . As a matter of fact they 've done experimentsthat demonstrate that hamsters , when they 're mating , secrete a hormone that makes them behave irresponsibly . Look , I hate to interrupt , but are we playing cards here or are we talking about cheesecake ? All right , all right . I 'm in.Thank you . He was at his brother Angelo 's wedding , in Gary . And everyone was having a great time . They were drinkin ' wine , makin ' toasts , and eatin ' . And all of a sudden , he looks across the room , and he sees this woman sitting ' there all by herself , eatin ' a piece of cheesecake with a knife and fork . I mean , come on , how often do you see a person eating ' a piece of cheesecake with a knife and fork ? They either eat it with their fingers or just a fork . It that why he married her ? Because she was eating a piece of cheesecake with a knife and a fork ? No , Gardino , it was a sign ! That 's how he knew she was the right woman for him . She was a lady . - Come on , Louis , it 's only matchsticks ! I do n't know ! Look , I ca n't see why we do n't play for real money . I mean , we 're cops . What are we gon na do , arrest ourselves ? No , but he will . I 'm sorry , I would feel honor-bound . Great ... I think there 's two million women on this planet you could be happy with . I mean you meet one and you got to ask yourself , is this number one , number two million , or number six hundred and seventeen . It 's a crap shoot , you know ? You could settle for six hundred and seventeen and tomorrow meet number eleven . I raise . Okay . Then Phyllis was number two million and one . She drove me crazy . She had a voice like a parakeet . Never shut up . Then there was Vanessa . She was number two million and two . She came from a family of meat packers . You gon na raise , Fraser ? Well , I 'm just wondering if I should . Perhaps you could refresh my memory . Does a straight beat when they are all the same kind ? Not even in Canada . I got trips . You know the only sign I ever got was from Janice , and that took five years . What was it ? From her lawyer . Came in the mail . So there we were , parked in the Rivera.It 's two o'clock in the morning , and she asks me where do I think this relationship is going . Look - - call or fold ! I mean , come on ! What kind of question is that to ask somebody at two o'clock in the morning ? Perhaps she was just being prudent . Are you in ? Fraser , nobody who 's prudent has any business being in love . I 'm telling you , man . It was a beautiful summer night and there was a soft breeze coming in off the lake . See , talk is bad . You talk , and before you know it , it 's all over , you 're married . Right ! And then what ? What about love ? What about that moment when you know that this is the woman you want to spend every waking hour with for the rest of your life ? Okay , my turn . I call . Look at this , I 'm playing poker with myself . I 'm telling you , you got ta have that moment in your life where you know you 'll never ever be the same again . When it happens , how do you know ? You just know . And that 's what happen to me on Saturday night . I got the sign . Now all you got to do is find her . Hey , I 'll find her . I 'll find her . I got a flush . Oh , so it is . I 'm terribly sorry . Look at this ! A Mountie sand-bagging . Who ever heard of a Mountie sand-bagging ? You only meet the woman of your dreams once in a lifetime . I 'll find her . You watch . Meanwhile , you want to deal ? Huh ? Deal ! Oh yeah . You know , there was a woman once , Ray . We were , uh ... I do n't know what we were . In the end , I tracked her up above the 62nd parallel into a place called Fortitude Pass . A storm had been blowing for days ; the whole world was white . By the time I found her I had lost everything - - my packs , my supplies , my ... everything . She was huddled in the lee side of a mountain crag.She was almost frozen , very near death ... I forced her to speak to me ... just talk to me ... say anything to keep the cold from taking her ... And it snowed for a day , and a night , and a day . I was delirious ; I almost gave up . The only thing I had to hold onto was the sound of her voice , which never wavered . She recited a poem . You know , funny thing ... I must have heard that poem a thousand times that night . I never heard the words . It ended ... badly . She had a ... She had a darkness inside her ... and the most beautiful voice . The most beautiful voice you ever heard . I 've got somebody entering the building . Copy . Someone 's coming in . She 's in the apartment ... She 's gone to the wardrobe ... She 's taking his clothes . Fraser , it 's her . Now she 's coming outside.Stop her . Police , hold it ! Hey ! There she goes , Fraser . The woman of my dreams . That was n't a sign , Fraser , it was an omen . Why did n't I see it ? Well , anyone can have a lapse in judgement , Ray . Nah , this is not a lapse , this is my life , Fraser . You know every time I think I 've found the right woman , she turns out to be the wrong one . The one I thought was wrong , we 'd make a date and I never show up . Six months later I 'm sitting in some pewand I 'm watching her walk down the aislewith some goomba and I 'm thinking ' that 's her , that 's the one . How did I let her slip through my fingers ? ' Uh , Ray . This one . This one I would have bet my soul on.Here she is working for Frank Bodine . Ray , slow down . She has no intention of losing you , Ray . You mean she 's a decoy ? She tricked us ? God , why do I love that ? The apartment.Hang on . They made me , Frank , get out of there . He 's gone . We missed him . The wardrobe is closed.She 'd left it open . What did he need so badly to go to all that trouble to get ? She was in and out of here in thirty seconds.She knew exactly where everything was . We 've been staring at this apartment for three days . Now , what do we know about this man ? You think she 's been living here with him ? We know he 's nearsighted . The TV is too close to the easy chair . And when we met him he was n't wearing glasses . Maybe contact lenses ? Ah , just because she 's doing his dirty work does n't mean that she 's -- He went to the wardrobe . How am I supposed to know ? These sheets have hospital corners . Oh thank god they 're not floral . Only a woman buys floral . That 's something you learn in the army , Ray . Not with a rap sheet like his . - What if he were in the National Guard ? Well , that would give him access to weapons . It 's missing.What ? What 's the one thing a guardsman is never suppose to be without ? His uniform . That 's what he came back for , Ray . His uniform . He was a sergeant in the National Guard , ' 85 through ' 88 . - Still active ? - With his record ? Check anyway , and get me the name and location of every unit he 's been a member of . 67th Regiment Armory , 57th Wabash . - Got ' em . - Thank you kindly , Elaine . Is that too much to ask for ? What exactly are shorty pajamas ? Oh , do n't ask , you 're better off . Me , I got ta fall for some hit-and-run driver who works for a stolen weapons dealer . Go figure . Go figure what ? It 's an American expression , Fraser . Do n't you think it 's about time you picked up the lingo ? It 's the cop ! Come on , baby , take out the cop . Take him out . She had the perfect shot , Fraser . She almost killed me . No , she did n't , Ray . - She missed you by seventeen centimeters . - What ? She was firing a Barretta 9mm , the light was at her back . The truck was barely moving . I pulled this out of the wall from behind you . What are you saying , that she missed me on purpose ? Her trajectory was offline by almost eight degrees which is impossible to do unless you 're trying . Ray , you 've only known this woman for a few seconds while you had a concussion . Yeah , well , it does n't matter , Fraser . I mean , 10 seconds , 10 years - chemistry is chemistry . I figure Bodine 's got something on her . Maybe she did something foolish when she was young , and Bodine is blackmailing her into helping him . Well , I-I suppose it 's a theory , but -- She really wants to get out . That 's why she 's sending me signals , Fraser . She wants me to rescue her ! Ray , Ray . Maybe you should n't think about this right now . No , I mean , come on . How often in a lifetime does this type of thing happen ? I mean , has it ever happened to you ? Well I-I , uh -- Of course not , you 're a Mountie . Oh great . Why do n't they call , huh ? Sitting on a half a million bucks worth of weapons , and I got ta deal with flakes ? Is the phone turned on ? Leave it on the table . You know , I still do n't know how you missed that cop . Neither do I . Off day I guess . Well , I do n't like that cop or his fruitcake Mountie friend . We should take ' em both out . Never learned how to relax , Frank . How are you ever going to enjoy that half million if you ca n't relax ? He 's a Mountie . These Mounties , they catch you sooner or later . I hate that . That 's not real life , Frank . That 's Rocky and Bullwinkle . Call me when the coffee 's ready . They made me , Frank , get out of there . Is that her voice ? She 's doing it under duress . What the hell were you doing following her ? She took some clothes out of Bodine 's apartment . Hey ! You do n't quit a stakeout ! - Oh , is that so ? - Yeah . Well , unless you 've got a little thing for that babe who 's decoying you . Did I ask your opinion ? Did anybody in this room ask for Detective Gardino 's opinion ? Can you give me the number she was calling from ? Sure , but she called from her car . It was a cell phone . No , you 've never gon na track a cell . It 's a nightmare . Not really . Not if you 've tracked caribou . Fraser ? Let 's try this one more time , okay ? We 're in Chicago . We are not tracking caribou , we 're tracking gun runners . - What time is it ? - 2:20 . - They said two o'clock . - I know I should have got half the money up front . That way they could n't stiff me . - Why did n't you think of that ? - I did . But what do I know ? . So what 's it called again ? It 's called triangulation , Ray . It 's the same technique that game wardens use to track caribou herds . Well , that 's fascinating , Fraser , but the last caribou spotted in Chicago was over three hundred years ago . That was the cell phone company.They found her number and picked up the signal . Here , near Carpentersville . It 's farmland mostly . Not too many folks with mobile phones in those parts . Does the phone have to be in use to pick up the signal ? No , it just has to be on to receive calls . It emits a signal unless the power 's off . What news could be bad ? The grid covers an area of over twenty square miles.Unless you plan to go door to door ... Okay , Fraser . How do we find the herd ? The cellular phone company sends a signal from their antenna to the phone . The phone then sends a signal back . We draw a line on the map from that location to the signal , then we move to another location , trip the signal again and draw another line . That 's our triangulation . Wherever those lines meet on the map that 's where we 'll find Bodine . If I find her , I have to arrest her , too . End of story . Well , yes . Yeah . Yeah ... . Uh-huh ... Where ? All right , we 'll meet you there in an hour . Pack your bikini , baby ! We 're getting something . There . You take the barn . I 'll take the house . Diefenbaker . Oh never mind . After she hit you ? I 'm gon na see her in jail , Fraser , if it 's the last thing I do . Sorry . This road intersects with the main highway in five point four kilometers . I want her , Fraser . If we can stop them from getting to the highway -- I 'm gon na put this chick away for a long time . She 'll be 90 before they let her out . Perhaps you should radio for backup . She wo n't be able to do this to me anymore . Ray , backup.Huh ? It might be a good idea to radio the sheriff 's station and request backup . Right . Patch me through to the Kane County Sheriff 's Station . - How long before we hit the highway ? - A few more minutes . Armed robbery , attempted murder . Assault and battery on a police officer . What do you figure ? Forty to life ? - I do n't know , Ray . - Hard time in Joliet . Slow down. Damn it , it 's them . Floor it , baby.Go , go ! Go-go-go ! Go-go-go ! Cut em off ! Cut em off . The other way . Go-go-go back ! Go-go-go ! Come on ! Damn ! Come on ! - You 're sure this is a good idea ? - Yes , Fraser . - You 're quite sure ? - Yes . - Now what ? - Go around it . - There 's no road . What 's the matter with you ? Then go through it ! Ray , I do n't mean to press the point , but we 're standing behind a 1971 Buick Riviera . They , on the other hand , are hurtling down a hill at roughly 47 miles an hour in a 6-ton , steel-plated military weapons carrier . Works for me.Very good . Go through it . No ! Oh , there you are . Out of donuts , are we ? Are you all right ? What happened ? It 's a long story . - You need an ambulance . - No .Good . - Oh , oh.Get out of here ! What ? Get out of here ! You can cut through the woods . You got ta get to the highway ! You 're letting me go ? I tried to kill you three times . What , are you deaf ? Get the hell out of here ! Special Agent Suzanne Chapin . Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . You just screwed up five months of work , Detective . hey 're gon na ask for my shield , Fraser . Nine years on the force , down the drain . There were mitigating circumstances , Ray . She 's a Fed , Fraser . I offered to let her go . She 's gon na put that in her report and three minutes later , Welsh is gon na call me into his office and ask for my shield . And he 'll be right . I would have bet my soul on her , Fraser . Stupid . See ? That is the trouble with signs . You get the right sign from the wrong woman , you end up paying for it for the rest of your life . Better he never saw that sign . Better it never happened . Then how would you know ? How would I know what ? If you never saw the sign , how would you know if you were wrong or right ? You do n't know . You just go on taking chances . Like every other dumb schmo . See , that is the great thing about love . It evens the odds . Anyone can be completely humiliated . Well , if there was a sign , and I could tell by the way he blew his nose or tipped his hat , I 'd want to know . Women do n't have signs . Men have signs . Women have biological imperatives . It 's true . I read it.Jeez , Gardino , it 's no wonder your wife left you for a pork roast . Come in . Yeah , sit down , Vecchio . Oh , I 'd rather stand , sir . Suit yourself . I have Special Agent Chapin 's report on the Bodine arrest here . Would you like me to read the relevant passage ? Yeah , sure . Why not ? " We were able to seize 850 assault weapons and put Frank Bodine in custody . This arrest could not have been accomplished without the assistance of Detective Ray Vecchio , who was instrumental in bringing this operation to a satisfactory conclusion . His hard work and courage in the face of danger were exemplary . " Congratulations , Detective . I 'm sorry , sir ? I said ' Congratulations . ' Yeah , yes . Thank you , sir . I got ta find her , Fraser . I took the liberty . Regent 's Park Hotel . Thanks . You want something , Detective ? That kiss meant something . Yeah , it meant ' step closer so I can hit you . ' You must be really good at your job . Then why did n't you report me ? Come on , who needs the paperwork ? Go home . That 's it , Fraser , that 's the sign . What is , Ray ? The look . She left me , but she left me for the right reason . She loves me . But she 's gone . Well , that 's what 's right for us . Maybe someday it wo n't be , but now it is . But you might never see each other again . Exactly . That 's what we need - ridiculous odds and just a speck of hope that someday we 'll beat ' em . I ca n't say I understand that , Ray . Well , of course you do n't . You are n't too swift at this stuff , are you , Fraser ? End bywmn001

You know , I hope you do n't mind my saying it , but you sure look good . I 'd hate for my wife to catch cold . AII right , Robin from the ' hood is in the house . Give me 7-1 1 , I do n't mean the store . Taketh from the rich and giveth unto the poor ! blow on these bones for me , would you , sIummy ? AII right ! Seven ! - AII right , Iet it ride . - No way , will . Odds of you repeating that are six-to-one . It says here do n't even make this bet in your dreams . carlton , and I , too , have a dream . And in it all of the world rises up and overcomes your stupidity ... now stay out of my face . Come on , do n't act like you never done it before . AII right , my lucky drawers is riding high , put your money on me or kiss it goodbye ! Can I get an amen ? - Amen . - Yes , sir . AII right . will , please , the book says there 's no way you can win . If I were you , I would n't touch those dice . Posse out , short stuff . Robin 's on a roll . AII right , here we go . Hoagies , cheese steaks , chicken on a spit ... seven come eleven ' cause I 'm too legit to quit ! Two pairs , kings and queens . Three aces . Sorry , Geoffrey . You 're $94 in the hole . should we play again ? I think not . Are you mad at me ? Of course not , Miss ashley . You play very well . Where did you learn ? A back alley in calcutta ? Go will . will , you 're insane . Quit while you 're ahead . - Yo ! Man with the bald head . - Yo . tell me what they said ! Seven ! Go will . Go will . Just checking ! Seven ! May I have everyone 's attention , please ? It 's time for the raffle . A cash prize of $1,000 . And the winner is ... number 10225 . - carlton , did you win ? - No , I did n't play ... and 10225 is my lucky number . Wait , hold it . " 10225 . " That 's me ! Go will . It is with great pleasure that I present you with this check ... in the amount of $1,000 . And it is with humongous pleasure that I take this chumpy off your hands . Can we get a picture of this please ? And now can we get a shot of will giving the check back to the L.A.P.C . ? Wait . Excuse me ? We 'd Iike a shot of you donating the money back to the L.A.P.C . Wait . What ? - You want me to donate $1,000 ? - That 's the idea . That 's a bad idea ... it says if they do n't have one , you do n't give them your money . Honest , Geoffrey , it 'd make me feel a Iot better if you 'd just take your money back . No , thank you . A gentleman always accepts his losses gracefully . Okay , Geoffrey , but you 're sure we 're still friends ? Of course , Miss ashley . I just do n't understand why you 're making such a big deal about this money . I mean , it ai n't like I took the Benz drag racing down Sunset ... - at 4:00 in the morning . - TattIetaIe . will , I 'm making a big deal because every year the club picks a charity ... and donates that money to that charity . But , uncle phil , look , if it 's supposed to be my money ... how come I ca n't do what I wan na do with it ? And I do n't wan na donate it to the L.A.P.C . Whoa , hold up . You calling a red leather suit with matching seat covers a whim ? will , you 're being awfully selfish . obviously , you have n't learned a thing since you 've been here . We 've all been blessed . And donating to someone less fortunate than yourself is not an option ... it 's a responsibility . I hear what you 're saying , uncle phil , you 're right . Keeping money that is n't yours is wrong . Very , very wrong . I know . Hey , ashley , honey , what 's up ? would everyone just get off my case ? I want to give him the money back , but he wo n't take it . Whoa , puberty 's in the house . Hey , you looking fine today . Thanks I did a little something different with my hair . Hey , here 's your boom box . I re-wired it . It works fine now . You owe me 50 cents . - How much for the shoe shine ? - $150 . Hey , I got ta make up the differences somewhere . How else am I gon na get to basketball camp ? AII right , well , hey , Iet 's just get out of here before ... Linda blair 's head starts spinning around . Good morning , baby . - Mommy , you look so pretty . - Thank you . hilary 's taking your father and me to brunch at the club today . I wanted to thank them for being helpful while I organized Monte carlo night . The way we all pulled together made me see the importance of family ... and how truly blessed I am . What about the rest of us ? We 're your family , too . Yeah , but if I take all of you I wo n't have enough money left over to buy a hat . After what will did last night , they 're all going to be gossiping about us . - Why put ourselves through that ? - They wo n't be gossiping . will gave the check back . Besides , people at our club are n't like that . I mean , no one cared about Mrs . SiIverberg 's divorce . I heard she 's been seeing the golf pro . I heard her husband caught them in the utility closet . But did you know that both of them were wearing nothing but cleats ? It was the tennis pro in the steam room . But the cleats part is right . Kids talk . You see , Vivian , everybody 's looking at us . No , they are n't . Vivian , I want to congratulate you on having such a talented daughter . - Here , in case you need this . - Thank you , but I do n't smoke . It 's gold . Something very strange is going on here . Excuse me . Waiter ? could we have the check , please ? - It 's already been taken care of . - By whom ? By the way , if you need to unload one of your cars , I can give you cash . I just sold a screenplay . Excuse me a minute . Henry ! What in God 's name is going on here ? If you needed money , why did n't you come to me ... instead of making will keep that check ? It was will 's idea . I told him to give it back . Sure . Sure , old man . George , would you tell him that will gave back that check please ? - well , I 'd love to , but he didn't . - But I told him to . well , this is obviously some kind of mistake . Oh , sure and Mrs . SiIverberg was wearing cleats ... because she forgot her shower shoes . No , I insist on paying you back . Here . A stick of DoubIemint costs but a few pennies . A few pennies , $94 . Why split hairs ? Miss ashley , you have offended my honor . Honor schmonor . It 's your male pride . Miss ashley ! I 'm sorry , Geoffrey , but I 'm sick and tired of men acting like pouty babies ... just because you beat them at something . Like the time I beat Bobby Greenspan at tetherbaII . After that , he told everyone at school that I took steroids . I apologize , Miss ashley . I have acted like an utter fool . That 's all right , Geoffrey . I had to stuff Bobby Greenspan in his locker before he would apologize . Man , I finally beat you . Hey , man , no , the sun was in my eyes . Man , the same sun was in my eyes . Stop being a baby . Hey , man , I ai n't being no baby . Man , I got ta go find G , he got some shoes for me to shine . philip , I 'm sure will just has n't gotten around to returning the check yet . Vivian , when I tell will to do something I expect for it to be done . Hey , Aunt Viv ! uncle phil . Whoa , you got that mad look in your eyes . Let me guess . You grabbed Geoffrey 's underwear by mistake , am I right ? will , why did n't you give that check to charity like I told you to ? - What you talking about ? I did . - Do n't stand there and lie to me . - I 'm not lying . - I just got back from the club ... and I 've never been so humiliated . I thought we had an agreement ... that that money was going to go where it was most needed . Now , you march upstairs and get me that check . well , I ca n't . You spent $1,000 and had another $1,000 to give to me for basketball camp ? I got ta raise your shoeshine rate . You gave the money to Ramon ? well , you know , it 's just a Ioan , till his sneaker endorsement comes through ... you know , around 2010 . will , that was very commendable , but that 's not what that money was raised for . Come on , uncle phil . You said I got a break ... and I was supposed to give somebody else a break ... so I gave the money to Ramon . He 's right , philip , you did say that . I'II still donate $1,000 to L.A.P.C . Yeah , that 's cool . But , Iooky here . Seeing as how you 're in this extremely generous mood ... I want to know if you was down with donating ... to the United Negro Nephew Fund . You know , they say a Saturday night is a terrible thing to waste . Country ... . Here we go , one more time , here it is ... . I thought we had an agreement , that we were gon na give that money to where ... . Be with me , people . Pray for me now . english 
@@5223241 So there I am , on my 25th birthday , driving from Wheeling , West Virginia , to Bensonhurst , in a Dodge Dart with no radio and a gunrunner named Barrelhead , who insisted we sing every Jimmy Buffett song he could recall . What could I say ? The man was heavily armed . So , 500 renditions of MargaritaviLLe later ... My first cover . Eight thousand words on how Barrelhead and his friends were transporting handguns for sale to New York City . The day the magazine hit the stands , the DA hit me with a subpoena . He wanted to know Barrelhead 's real name . And Greta had been managing editor for three whole days . So she invited me across the street to the fancy bar where they use real glasses . And after about the sixth vodka and tonic , she said , " Fletch , I want you to know the magazine is behind you . " Well , I was impressed . " I 'm 45 . I 've given up a lot . I 've given up the road , that life ... Thanks , Elizabeth . No regrets . My lovely wife . I 've given up drinking . I 've given up drugs . Greta taught me there 's two things you never give up . One 's rock and roll . The other 's a source . Greta Sims . MAN : Great memories , Greta . WOMAN : We 'll miss you , Greta . I only hope you can adjust to the lack of stress in your ... Fletch ? Fletch ? Fletcher ? Fletch ? Fletcher ? Fletcher ? Honey ? Sweetie ? Are you okay ?  Are you okay ? I flung the investment .  What did you say ? I flung the investment . Why consign ? Why consign ? I 'll call 911 . It 's proficient . Why disqualify the rush ? I 'm tabled . I 'm tabled .  Need your advice . " We " are n't here . House is in Baltimore lying to Medicaid about his billings . So ? I 'm board certified . You are not House . Why 'd you put me in charge of the department if you think I ca n't handle it ? Because it 's temporary , and because I was ordered to . What are the symptoms ? Oh , come on . You 're gon na diagnose him without meeting him ? Prove that you 're as brilliant as House ? I need to know the symptoms to know which hospital to recommend . EMT 's report : patient struck his head and is suffering from aphasia . A neurological problem . You know , I know a lot of good people in that field , seeing as I happen to be a neurologist . You 're pouting . Not at all . Taylor 's pretty good . House was ready to hire him till he got my resume . It 's Fletcher Stone . Wrote 12 books , exposed three administrations . Before he exposes us ... Thank you . Or maybe you should call him . What if I say something stupid ? God . House is easier .  You taking any drugs ? I displaced my function . Accolade . He used to drink regularly , but he 's been clean and sober for nearly a year . Mr . Stone , you think you 're speaking normally , but your speech is impaired . He knows what he wants to say , but when he reaches for a word , he finds something else . I grapple average . Tanzer glisten ? He does n't know that he 's saying it wrong ? It all sounds right to him . I want you to write your name and draw a face . It 's called agraphia . Loss of ability to write . Most often , it 's temporary . How hard did he hit his head ? It was a pretty good crack . It made a really ugly sound . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Of golf . " Do you understand me ? Yes . Elizabeth . Fletch . Is he okay ? We do n't know . This is Fletch 's editor . Greta Sims . I wanted to make sure that the EMTs told you the right story . How many stories are there ? He did n't trip . He just fell . Out of the blue . His foot jerked a little bit , first . That 's what made it look like a trip . STACY : Do n't say anything . Do n't attempt to defend your billing practices . Your billing practices are indefensible . We 've been over this . If I thought you were capable of listening , I 'd shut up . That makes no sense at all . Good afternoon . Good afternoon . Every case you have rates a five on the complexity scale ? Dr . House has a rather specialized practice . Ah . Okay . Then let 's go through these . All of these ? If you have lunch reservations , cancel them . All right . Patient ... One person says he did n't . Who are we gon na believe ? His symptoms can all be explained by the head trauma . It causes a contusion or a seizure . That causes the aphasia . We should get an EEG . If it was a stroke , could be a clotting issue . Even if he fell , drug use is far more likely . I 'm ordering a tox screen . Chase . We 're not done with the differential . You 're not my boss . I 'm House 's boss . House is your boss . The math is pretty simple . Are you signing my paychecks ? Are you hiring and firing ? This is not about that . The only thing you 've been asked to do is supervise House , in case he does something insane . Which might , you know , save a life . Somebody 's got ta be in charge . I think we 're grown-up enough to reach a consensus . Patient , 62 years old . You prescribed Viagra . I look in vain for the words " erectile dysfunction " in the notes for Dolores Smith . She had a heart condition . And you ran out of nitroglycerin ? She also had low blood pressure , so nitro would be dangerous . The little blue pills improve blood flow . They 're vasodilators . That 's why you sometimes get headaches . I think Dr . House understands ... Of course I do . The woman has a heart condition , she 's on her own . A man ca n't nail his office assistant , it 's national crisis time . Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication ? Fine . I 'll pay for it . How much are the pills ? She took how many ? Put the money away . Are you trying to bribe me ? No . I could ... You 're retiring in three weeks . You 've been doing this job nearly 20 years . Are n't you tired of administering policy that you disagree with ? I never said I disagree ... What can they do to you ? And Dr . House is sorry about his earlier outburst . Absolutely . You do background checks on Medicaid personnel ? I do what 's necessary for my client . Wow . New personal record . Yeah . Timing 's good for me , too . Got a reservation at a little place in the inner Harbor . You booked us dinner reservations ? Best Maryland crab in Maryland . Do n't you have a plane to catch ? Not for hours . Your flight leaves at 7:00 . You did a background check on me ? And mine does n't leave till 9:00 p.m . It looks like you 'll be dining alone . You checked on my flight so you could be sure to be on a different one . Where 's your crucifix ? I left it at the jeweler 's to be cleaned . Right . This will show us if there 's a problem with your carotid artery that might cause a blood clot . If it went to his brain , it could explain the aphasia and the falling down . And you 're giving him an EEG . Is that for the same thing ? It 's just a precaution . I think the trauma caused some swelling and we need to keep him stable until the body can repair the damage . And you think they 're both wrong ? We 're just covering all the bases . We 're being safe .   His O2 stats are going down .  Fluid in his lungs . I 'll push 40 lV Lasix . We need to intubate . He 's losing his respiratory drive . Put him down . Put him down . FOREMAN : And then there were two . Aphasia and fluid in the lungs . Unless he had an abnormal heart rhythm . And then there was one . Urine test was positive for amphetamines . Amphetamines do n't cause pulmonary edema . They do if you smoke them . Well , in one of his books , he talked about giving up drugs and alcohol . How it changed his life . Everybody lies . When he started wanting to hear every minute of my day , it should have been a clue he was the jealous type . But you know , in that first stage of a relationship , where it 's like your body 's full of these chemicals that make you think everything they do is charming .  Excuse me . wilson : hello . Hey , honey . How are the kids ? Do they miss me ? This may take a minute . HOUSE : So , what 's new with Mr . Aphasia ? Cuddy called you ? Everybody covers their ass . Pulmonary edema . Chase did a tox screen . It came back positive for amphetamines . I thought the kids did n't call you . I know the way you tell stories . Foreman went to talk to Stone about his drug test , found him running a temperature . So it 's not the drugs . They 've just got such a bad rep . Honey , you should n't do that . Okay , I got ta hang up . They 're probably trying to reach me . You do n't have call waiting ? I 'm hanging up on you now . wilson : It 's $5 a month . Drugs do n't cause fever . Encephalitis or meningitis are the obvious suspects . Start him on antibiotics . It could be an autoimmune disease . Lupus , Behcet 's ... We could start him on a high dose of steroids . Except if he does have encephalitis , steroids could weaken his immune system . Foreman . How high a fever ? Put me on speakerphone . And why have n't you called me ? 101 . What if it 's autoimmune ? Well , then we 're screwed , which is why we need more information . Any genetic issue with the family ? FOREMAN : The man ca n't talk . His medical records are sketchy . And the wife 's only known him a couple of years . HOUSE : MRI show anything ? The CT scan was negative . " CT . " That 's like short for " mri , " right ? excellent . That 's going to save us a Lot of time . We 've got an mri scheduled in 20 minutes . Earliest Foreman could get the machine . I teach you to lie and cheat and steal , and as soon as my back is turned , you wait in line ? Get an mri and get a better medical history . The man ca n't talk ! So , you 're in charge of us because you 're in charge of him ? Any family history of neurological problems ? No . Have you been out of the country in the last five years ? Yes . Three years ? Yes . Two years ? He stopped traveling for work two years ago , after we got serious . Any vacations ? His last one was six months ago . This golf resort at Key Biscayne . No way it was a golf resort . Knowing Fletch , I assumed he was working his way through every bar in the Keys , a last hurrah before settling down . Alcohol ? No . Amphetamines ? No . You tested positive . He does n't use drugs . I told you . When we got engaged , we decided we wanted a different kind of life . And he dropped the macho journalism . No more taking crazy chances . That includes his health . He asked me not to tell Elizabeth . BE , before Elizabeth , he used drugs recreationally . I was n't crazy about it , but that thrill-seeking behavior is what made him the kind of journalist that he was . And now ? AE ? Man 's twisted himself into knots for her . Completely cleaned up his act . But the drugs ? They 're medicinal . Sort of . He was having trouble sleeping . This new suburban lifestyle . Lack of excitement was throwing him off . So he started with sleeping pills . When they knocked him out , he needed something to perk him back up during the day . Every day ? No slippery slope there . Keep the stain ! Knife ca n't force . We 're not gon na tell your wife . We 're not cops . There 's a little edema , brain swelling , and an area of scarring . Is that what 's causing the aphasia ? Actually , that 's what 's odd . The scarring 's not in the area of the brain normally associated with conduction aphasia . Or it might have nothing to do with it at all . Have you ever had head trauma before ? An accident ? Ever had any numbness on one side before ? Dizziness ? What is the durable ? No . WOMAN :  ALL departing passengers for flight Number 870 , the plane will be delayed by one haLf-hour . We apologize for any inconvenience . I got you some coffee . So , what do you want to talk about ? The scarring on the mri could be anything . MS , toxins , any one of 100 demyelinating diseases . If it 's meningitis , we have to lD the bug fast . We need to do a lumbar puncture . I 'm not doing an LP with this edema . We could paralyze him . What does House say ? " The person you are trying to reach is out of the area or has turned off their phone . Have fun . How 's the patient ? Fine . Where are you going ? FOREMAN : Dinner . Oh , well , I 'll join you , and you can bring me up to speed . Oh , sorry . Reservation for two . When people give themselves away , it 's by little things . That woman over there ... She 's not sneering at her coffee . She 's recovering from Bell 's palsy . And the cashier at the coffee place ... She does n't want anyone to know , but she 's dying of ALS . There 's a particular sort of twitchy , stiff arm that 's characteristic . And then there 's you . Why are n't you wearing your cross ? I told you I left it at ... You keep jewelry cleaner under the sink so you wo n't have to go a day without it . True , you forgot it that morning that our pipes burst , but then you went back and waded through the flood to retrieve it . Caffeine pills and amphetamines . Same stuff he told us he was taking . And Topamax . An anticonvulsant ? But he said there was no history of prior seizure . It 's not even prescribed to him . Still does n't explain his fever . He 's probably just using it for weight loss . Just gives us another lie . He must really be devoted . Should we check the home ? If he wanted to hide something from his wife , why would n't he hide it in the office ? Or maybe she 's hiding something . Nothing but aspirin and flu meds in the bathroom . Looks like this stuff 's been sitting here for weeks . CHASE : Home improvement . He probably thought he could take the project on , then realized it was a little more than he could handle . " I never said that . I guess it 's safe to be confident when House is there to overrule you . Now that it 's all on you ... It 's different . Yeah . Either you left it behind on purpose , or by mistake . The only reason you 'd leave it behind intentionally is if it no longer meant anything to you . But since it was a gift from your mom , that would mean you had a fight with her . But since you do n't talk to ghosts , that 's unlikely . Leave it alone , Greg . Yeah , I 'm good at that . So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally . But then we have to explain why you did n't go back for it when you realized ... I did n't realize until I got to the airport . Nope . You were wearing makeup when you got to the airport . You ca n't put on makeup without looking at yourself . Anomalies bug me . Then you 're gon na suffer .  I think it 's his stomach . I teal indigent . Was it something you ate ? He keeps doing that . I teal indigent . Are you hungry ? No . No , he 's in pain . Is it a sharp pain ? No . Teal indigent ! Taste ? Yes . A metallic taste ? Yes ! I 'll be right back . HOUSE : I suppose it 's also possible that the clasp broke , but then you 'd be carrying the thing around in your purse ... We had a fight . We had a fight , and I was angry and not thinking straight , and I walked out without my makeup and without my cross . I stopped at the drugstore to buy makeup , but I could n't buy a cross , because they do n't have an aisle for personal talismans ! So you had a fight . Mark 's tired . He 's worried . He 's got mobility problems . It 's normal to blow up over little things . I do n't mind fighting over little things . I did n't mind fighting over big things . That I could understand . We fight over nothing . You know , a mailbox with a sign that says , " Last pickup 5:00 p.m . " Does that mean last pickup to go to the post office , or last pickup to leave the post office and be sent out of town ? You fought over mail delivery ? I tried to get him to drop the subject , but he would n't . I told him he was right . He thought I was being condescending . You were . He 's pushing me out of his life . Maybe you 're misinterpreting . Did I misinterpret with you ? At least , this time I recognize it . That 's the benefit of convincing the only two men you 've ever loved they 're better off without you . "  I 'm going to go wash my face , so I look like a grownup again .  Hello . It 's for you . House . Do you know your phone 's dead ? Do you ever recharge your batteries ? HOUSE : They recharge ? I just keep buying new phones . I thought you should know your aphasia guy is tasting metal . Where 's his creatinine ? wilson : 6.8 . He 's got kidney failure . Cameron 's got him on dialysis , and he 's stable for the moment . Unlike Cuddy , who 's suicidal . It 's either meningitis or encephalitis . Or maybe autoimmune . That 's perfect . Seems like you really narrowed it down over dinner . Here 's the plan . We talk to House . We 've been trying . He 's not answering his cell . It 's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture .  There 's no choice anymore . Is Cuddy there , ranting ? If I 'd known you 'd be out of contact ... They can handle it . CUDDY : Right . So far , only three organ systems have failed . HOUSE : Okay , they ca n't . Does n't matter . The guy 's not stable enough to move . So go rant in your own office . Fine . Call me when you 're done . What do you mean by doing the LP just right ? We 're not gon na screw it up . The odds are , this guy knows something we do n't . He could know the answer to the meaning of life , the man ca n't communicate ! Have you had any indication that he 's tried to communicate something important ? No . Well , that 's because you guys have n't scared him enough . " Why should he say anything ? When you prep him , tell him he 's gon na die . Crush all hope . Do n't Let Cameron do it . Cuddy , you got a problem with any of that ? You 're scheduled for a lumbar puncture , but you should n't count on that having the answers . If your husband continues to decline ... You 'll die . If there 's anything you have n't told us ... How you holding up ? I know what you just heard is scary as hell , but ... Could n't tackle the bear . Could n't tackle the bear . They took my stain . WOMAN :  Attention , please . Due to weather conditions , all flights are grounded till further notice . Cots are being provided on the Lower level . We apologize for the inconvenience . WOMAN : I do n't believe it . I booked a room at the airport hotel when I saw how bad the weather was . It 's the last one available . Your leg ca n't handle a night on a cot . Thanks . I 'm ready . Right . The hotel 's upstairs . Does Mark know about this ? Mark knows that when things are bad , I always like to have an escape route planned .   I have to know what 's going on here . Because when you have a fight with Mark and you try to avoid me , then I have to think that ... That I 'm feeling vulnerable , and I do n't want to be around you , because it might lead to something . Right . But then , a hotel room ... Might also lead to something . So , which is it ? Our relationship 's like an addiction . It 's like ... Really good drugs ? No , it 's like Vindaloo curry . I know what it is . Did n't think it was addictive . You 're abrasive and annoying , and you come on way too strong . Like Vindaloo curry . And when you 're crazy about curry , that 's fine . But no matter how much you love curry , you have too much of it , it takes the roof of your mouth off . And then you never want to see curry for a really , really long time . But you wake up one day and you think , " God , I really miss curry . " You 're a jerk . I know . If you had n't just had a fight with Mark ... For once in your life , will you shut up ?  House . You 're on speakerphone . How did the LP go ? Give me the Reader 's Digest condensed version . preliminary results are some kind of infection which narrows it down ... From infinity , yeah . CAMERON : He was trying to tell us something . What did he say ? You were wrong . It was n't the fear . He opened up to me when I ... A sympathetic presence after a traumatic moment . Classic interrogation technique . What did he say ? You knew that I 'd ... Act the way you always do ? Yeah , I did . What did he say ? He could n't tackle the bear . Now all we need is the English-Aphasic dictionary . A fluent aphasic retrieves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants . They could be filed by sound or by meanings . So if he wants to say " table , " he could say " label " or he could say " chair . " Or he could just say " jabberwocky . " There 's no way to tell . He also said , " They took my stain . " Hold on . Write down everything he says . Stacy .  That new makeup you bought , do you mind if I borrow it ? What did you mean by " stain " ? Dirty , soiled ... No , no . What about rhymes ? Pain ? Brain ? Thane ? He is dying from some kind of infection , and you all are playing word games ? Is there anything else you have n't told us ? Let 's start this again . " Bear . " Is it " bare " as in " naked " ? Crimson Desire shows up well on Sheetrock . That 's why I chose it . HOUSE : You must have gotten one new phrase out of him . Something . We 've been talking to him for hours . Maybe he 's just given up . You sure you 've told me everything you found at his home and office ? No , we 're hiding something . Maybe it 's not a rhyme or a synonym . He mentioned " stain " once before , when Chase was giving him the mri . Before we scared him . He did ? It 's in your notes . CHASE : So he only talks during MRIs and Lumbar punctures ? Your theory is he can only talk with a needle in his back or ... When his wife 's not in the room . The more devoted , the more reason to lie . That 's cynical . You disagree ? No , I 'm just kveLLing . Our little girl is growing up . Okay , what 's the best way to rip a woman from the side of her dying husband ? You woke me up to lie to a patient 's wife ? Tell her there 's been a miscommunication over their insurance coverage . Not a big deal . Tell me . If it is your aim to sell me the same crazy ideas that House does , how are you an improvement on House ? I brought you a coffee . Greg , they ca n't leave without you .  You checked your knapsack . Are we in ? Yeah . Hi . I 'm Gregory House . I 'm your attending physician . Your wife 's not there . Start talking . They took my stain . I could n't tackle the bear . They took my stain . Okay , shut up now . Nice work , Cameron . Give him the list again . Let us know when something sounds right . Dirty , soiled , pain , brain ... Yes . FOREMAN : Where does that get us ? We 're already paying plenty of attention to his brain . We 've got an mri , got a CT ... Are we sure he was n't reacting to " pain " ? He 's been on painkillers .

You have to come with me , sir . I 'm not going anywhere . Do you think you 're gon na take me on ? I kick and I bite . You 're either on that plane , or you 're going into custody . FOREMAN : House ? Are you still there ? Being bipolar makes you take risks . You seek excitement , you make up stories . I dime value tale lever ! Fine , maybe your stories are legit . But people would start to wonder . Annoyed politicians , entire governments would be on your ass . So you could n't tell anybody you were bipolar . Which was fine . Until you fell in love . And you wanted that life . And you hear that there 's a surgical cure . You can give the woman you love the life she wants . And if it 's done by Gamma Knife , there 's no trace of cutting . That 's the neural scarring we saw on the mri . Which explained nothing , because it was n't even in the right area . It 's not the surgery , it 's the secrecy .

It was your secret trip for your secret surgery in Caracas or Buenos Aires . Which , by the way , did n't work , given the state of your kitchen cabinets . House . Shut up . What 's going on ? Is he right ? Your doctors know you better than I do . That man on the speakerphone , he never even met you , and he knows you better than I do . You love me ? Yes . Yes . You just do n't trust me . Yeah . FOREMAN : Cerebral malaria . I 'll get him started on intravenous quinidine .

@@5223341 Adell , what 's going on ? Gardener saw a bloody kid all on her own . Called in at 2:48 P.M . You get an ID ? Not yet . We 're door-to-door every house on the block expanding the perimeter . No missing persons ? No car accidents ? Nothing in the immediate area . Okay . What do you got ? There 's not a scratch on her . Hi . Well , the blood had to come from somewhere , did n't it ? My guess is that someone close to this child is either dead ... or dying . I 'm going to take this . Okay . Hematrace . Good job . You are a good girl . It 's human blood . Okay , and we know it 's not hers , right ? Okay . You know what ... let 's bag the sleeper and get it to Megan . We need DNA and trace on the fabric . You ... are a good girl . Too much blood for a casual injury . How far could she have possibly walked ? I do n't know . But I 'll tell you what I 'm more interested in is that sunburn on the side of her face . You have a sunburn on one side of your face ... it means you 've been walking in a straight line , does n't it ? Our gardener said she was headed towards hibiscus avenue . Hibiscus ... which means she was traveling due north . Hey , guys . Hey . Everybody 's talking about the bloody child . Do we even know where she came from ? That 's the question . This is the answer . Want a leg or a foot ? Some type of soil . From any lawn that she crossed ? Well , her feet were soaked with blood . Well , that narrows it down . I 'm going to go look at this for a little while . Let me know . Help ! Help ! Somebody help ! All right . Duquesne . Make that three . Another male . Out of how many samples ? We 're three for three and counting . Yep , somebody 's trading the old for the new . The soil on the toddler 's feet was laced with glyphosate . That 's a heavy-duty grass killer . They may be resodding . So let 's look for a location where they 're resodding , okay ? Horatio . Go ahead . We 've got four different bleeders , and based on the alleles , they 're all related to the girl . Horatio , we spotted the house that 's being resodded . It 's coming up on your right . I 'll get fire and rescue . Easy . This is the place . Ready ? Yeah . Detective Sevilla ! Miami-Dade Police ! Miami-Dade Police Department ! Police department ! Get me rescue in here ! I have a survivor ! Roll firerescue ! Who did this to you , sir ? My son ... needs help ... Listen to me . Think ... Yeah ? We got another one . Okay . Have your guys hang out . They 're going to be here awhile . What 's that ? What ? The final blood count is five . Four dead , three kids . One adult survived . Any sign of an intruder ? Not at first glance . Well , the last guy standing is the one I want to talk to . Actually , he 's not standing ; he 's riding . That was him . Where 's the little girl ? She 's with social services till they place her with the family . If she has any left . Let 's start in the back , Eric . Might take a minute to acclimate yourself . There 's a whole lot of red in there . Okay ? Occupants are Jason and Stephanie Caplin . Dad 's an optician at Stonybrook Mall . Mom 's a stay-at-home . Four kids : The oldest is Luke , he 's 16 ; Timothy 's 9 and the only other victim found in a separate room . And Max ... six weeks . Not a very long time down with us , Angel . And back up you go . Neighbors say nice family nice kids , never any problems . Mom was tired because of new baby . Front and sliding glass doors were both open . No signs of forced entry , though . Nothing else suspicious on the outside perimeter of the house , either . Okay , so everything we need is right here ... and we have a happy , all-american family shotgunned to death in their home . Except the dad and the toddler . Right , but the toddler belonged home . What was the dad doing here ? Along with two kids who should 've been in school . Alexx , do we have a time of death ? Between 11:00 A.M . and 1:00 P.M . Was everyone home for lunch and they got surprised by someone ? Someone they knew . And a number four buck . That 's a hell of a recoil . So it could 've bounced out of someone 's hand and made the three feet , right ? Yeah , it could 've come out of dad 's grip or come out of mom 's . All right , let 's GSR everybody and start with mom . Well , if we 're looking at murder-suicide , she was the last to die . Right . So we need a timeline . Who was shot when ? Let 's work on that . The blood will give us that , but it 's going to take a while . Take all the time you need . Let 's alert the neighbors they 're going to have company for awhile . You bet . The wound area 's wide . From a pellet pattern , right ? Enough distance from the shooter to the victim for the pellets to spread . No defensive posture . That 's because he was taken by surprise . Probably because of these . If he died four hours ago with his mother and brothers , his fever was 103 . So , he was home sick . When you 're ready to snap , one more tug on your sleeve is all it takes . Okay . This is the only unmade bed in the house . Yeah , kids are cleaning their rooms . Mom and dad lived like this . Mom was , anyway . Dad 's getting his needs met somehow . Everything in here is washed and pressed . There 's a crib in the room . Yeah , nobody 's getting any sleep . It 's no excuse . Baby 's first jewelry was an amulet ? Oh , you can get them at any corner botanica . Not exactly the place you 'd shop for a newborn . They 're actually supposed to ward off evil spirits . So is this . Paroxetine HCl . It 's an antidepressant . Bottle 's full . It was filled three weeks ago . Hey . There you go . Thanks . I do n't see blood or any sign of struggle in here . No , not physical anyway . This place is n't a mess . It 's downright filthy . Kids will pick up after themselves , but they will not clean . Empty fridge ... overflowing garbage . They obviously live on fast food . Looks like somebody did n't eat their lunch today . Got a couple of burgers ... half-eaten fry . Would n't have lasted ten minutes in my house . Well , mom did give up the fight . Who 's been taking care of the family ? Sick kid , teenager 's out of school early ... dad picks up lunch for everyone ? I got a point on the timeline , or at least a place to start . We isolated specific bleeders on parts of the sleeper , but on the feet , it was an extreme amount of everyone 's blood . So that means the toddler was over Luke when he bled out . This victim , this room temperature probably did n't take but a few minutes . Hmm , so she was inside within minutes of the killing , but she 's the only family member not shot . Why ? Why was she spared ? She 's the only girl . She was hiding . Maybe she was just lucky . Mom normally drives the wagon , but it has n't been used in a while . Was that door closed ? Yeah , the garage door was down . So dad goes to work , like normal . At 11:45 , he gets a call from mom , and then he leaves upset , right ? So dad 's out of surgery ? Not yet . Sevilla spoke to his assistant . Dad leaves his keys in the ignition ... but remembers to close the garage door . And here 's the gun safe . What is it ? It 's ammonia . Females do n't usually suicide by shotgun - - too messy . Well , did you see the house ? I think there was a bigger concern than mess . Okay , Speed , how long do you think you 're going to be here ? All night . All night . Okay , keep me posted . Alexx ? Luke , 16 years old . Shot twice : Once in the shoulder , once at the base of the skull . Two wounds . Maybe he was on the move . Running only gave the buckshot pattern room to expand . Enough to hit the baby . Newborn - - a few pellets was all it took . People really do n't chew , especially hungry teens . And the infamous half-eaten bag of french fries . So ... Luke brings home lunch but does n't get to eat because the killing has started . Something else . He had an acute gastric ulcer . He bit his nails , and the enamel on the dentition ... 16 going on 40 . What about the mother 's reach ? Twenty-seven inches . Shotgun muzzle is 24.5 . She could have absolutely reached that trigger . No gunshot residue on her hands . Not unusual with a long barrel . Dad and Luke ? There 's too much blood on both of them to tell . What about the mother 's wound ? One shot , close contact , pellets were a compact mass pushed by a pressurized gas cloud into the brain , turning the medulla to pulp . So she died instantly . And the nine-year-old 's wound was immediately fatal , as well . One shot , dead center , severed his spinal cord . Horatio . Okay . Jason Caplin just got out of surgery . Buckshot penetrated his kidney . We removed it . Packed and ligated the renal artery . Sutured his multiple splenic lacerations . He 's got some will to live . Did he say anything about his family ? Just that he thought he heard the baby screaming . Mr . Caplin ? I 'm Detective Sevilla . I was at your house yesterday . Do you have any idea who did this to you ? I do n't know . I ... I saw my son . He was ... he was hurt . Did you see anyone else ? An intruder , maybe ? I felt this ... this heat on my back . I heard the baby cry ... I do n't know . That 's okay . Tell me , Mr . Caplin , what were you doing home from work ? My wife had called . She was upset ... You 're never here ! I ca n't do this alone ! We 're both tired . You do n't know what tired is ! Make him stop ! You 've got to do something to make him stop , or I ... Or what ? Mr . Caplin ? Did your wife threaten to hurt herself or the children ? No . She ... she loved them . Hey . Hey . Dad 's clothes ... Is he talking ? He 's not winning any spelling bees , but he was lucid . Okay , now , he claims his wife called him at the office and he came home . Did he say why ? She was upset , baby would n't stop crying . Now , it sounded like U-turns from office to home were not unusual . Okay , did he say he saw who shot him ? No . Now , he remembers coming in ... seeing his son covered in blood , and then the next thing you know , he felt a hot pain in his back . Okay , in all your years , did you ever hear of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the back ? Most people ca n't pull off shots to the front ... without a fifth of scotch and a very nimble big toe . Okay , so hormonal depression and long arms could get us there . Okay . What do you got ? Some hairs from the master bedroom . Long , dark . Mom 's a blonde . Now , how are the crime scene sketches coming ? Marking evidence as it rolls in . Megan ran the hairs from the master bed . Not the mom , but a female relative . The sister was so broken up . Or maybe mom had more than hormones and kids to worry about , huh ? Did you know your sister was seeing a psychiatrist ? Yeah . Yeah , she was having a rough time . Not sleeping , and , th-the baby ... the ... the baby cried a lot ; colic . And she , uh ... Here you go . Thank you . She ... she was having a hard time . Can you be more specific ? Because , you know , baby blues are one thing , but postpartum psychosis , that 's quite another . My sister was depressed . She was n't crazy . She had medication that she was n't taking . She was worried about what it would do to the baby . She was nursing . Have you seen that before ? Yeah . How about your brother-in-law ? Did you help him feel better ? We have evidence that you were in their bed recently . All I wanted was my sister 's happiness . Well , that goal can get you into trouble . Where were you yesterday morning ? In Buffalo , on business . If you do n't believe me , call the airline . Still does n't explain your little trick between the sheets . I held my sister when she could n't stop crying . When she could n't get out of bed , much less the house . And that 's a hell of a lot more than he did . And that 's your brother-in-law you 're talking about ? Yeah , Jason . He hid at work day and night , leaving her alone with four kids . Well , sounds like it was too much for her . It was too much for anyone . My sister loved those kids . Yeah , they drove her nuts . I fumed the shotgun , but there were no usable prints on it . Okay . So who do we think was feeding the infant ? Timmy 's prints were on the bottle . Right , so the nine-year-old is parenting the baby while the mother is doing what ? I do n't know , maybe she was opening the gun safe . Hers were the only prints on it . So then why did n't she kill the toddler ? Could n't find her ? I mean , she 's a woman who ca n't function . If you ca n't function , you ca n't keep track of your children . That 's true . You know , plenty of times my parents wanted me gone , but at least they fell short of taking me out . Yeah , how short ? Just short , or miles away ? What does " Delko " stand for , anyways ? " Delektorsky . " My dad 's Russian , my mom 's Cuban . Yeah ? Yeah . Maybe . So you think the little girl was the favorite , and that 's why she made it ? Who knows ? That 's what we 're here to find out . Yeah . Let 's find out . They do n't have a dog . Well , if they did , it did n't last . But I guess we know how the toddler did . I removed the pellets from the shotgun shells , but I left all the powder in , so it should give us a good kick . Okay . And usually suicides ... lean forward to get a better shot . Right , which would create spatter directly above , right ? But in this case , the blood is back here . So she needs to be back . That 's good . Be about here . Yeah . Are you clear ? All right , here we go . There you have it . You used boiled noodles , huh ? For brain spatter it was either that or oysters . The blood on the blanket from the doghouse proves ... that the toddler was there after someone was injured . Right , but her feet were drenched with the blood from all five victims , though . Not until after she was hiding in the backyard . The transfer from the blanket came from one bleeder : The mom . And there 's no chance she walked outside by herself ? No . I scraped every inch of that blanket . It was loaded with her saliva and epithelial . But no trace chemicals or soil from the backyard . Eleven feet , four inches from the doghouse to the closest doorway . Someone had to have carried her . So who had glyphosate and soil on their shoes ? That 's what we need to find out , gentlemen . Let 's do that . Okay , here we go . Luke has traces of glyphosate and soil on his shoes . So does dad . No one else . Either one of them could 've been out back doing yard work . So , her wound was instantly fatal . Which means someone was still standing after she died . And that means that this is not a murder-suicide . It 's a murder , is n't it ? Now , there are only two family members left capable of doing this . And that 's Luke and dad . You think the kid could 've done this ? I do n't know . He 's a 16-year-old kid with an ulcer . Maybe he got sick of taking care of everyone . What do you think ? Why are you looking at the pants and not the shirts ? Shirts are a mess . Any spatter from a vic 's going to be lost among the primary . But it 's hard to get spatter with a shotgun - - the barrel 's too long . Unless we 're not looking for spatter . That 's transfer . That 's tread ... from the toddler 's footies . The question is : Whose blood is it ? Speed . Mom 's blood . Instinctively , he picked up the toddler , thinking the killer might still be in the house . And he did it after mom was mortally wounded . Okay , so mom and dad are n't doing their jobs . The oldest son steps up to the plate . Luke tries to bring his siblings lunch ... and walks into a massacre . Once Luke 's in the living room , why not save the infant ? The swing and the bassinet were in the room . I do n't know . Judgment call . Who could imagine shooting something so small ? While Luke is busy saving the toddler , the killer goes after his next threat : Timmy . Nine-year-old boy ; some threat . Okay , so Luke comes back in , tries to save the infant . But he dies trying to get the infant out the front door . And why does that happen ? Dad was blocking his path . But dad 's been shot in the back , and his wound is not self-inflicted . Wait a minute . Speed ... whose blood did we find on the infant 's clothes ? Let 's take a look at that . Show me . The infant 's own ... Of course ... Luke 's ... mom 's spatter . Where 's dad 's blood ? Those are gravitational droplets . Good morning . Oh , finally . You the insurance adjusters ? Oh , hold on . You 're , uh ... I 'm a criminalist . Mr . Caplin , I 'm with the MDPD . This is Detective Sevilla . Right , right . From the hospital . You 're feeling better . Well , I spent four days in the hospital flat on my back . I have staples holding my chest together , and they 're pulling up the flooring in my house , because it 's rotted with blood . Yes , blood . Blood is why we came today . We want to talk to you about your blood on your baby . I ... Spatter normally travels , but in this case , we found gravitational droplets of blood on your baby 's clothes . And just to be clear , that 's a problem . Right . Because that proves that you wer standing over him while you were bleeding . Luke 's body was covering that baby . He died protecting that child . And you had , shall we say , other instincts . You thought he would n't risk the shot if you had the infant in your arms . Reverse the situation , and you did n't hesitate . I never slept . I-I could n't think . I mean , even at work , I could hear them screaming for more . One morning I woke up , and I just knew ... I could n't face them again . So you shot them in the back . I tried , I-I ... I-I just could n't . Did he just confess ? He 's laying the groundwork for his defense . " Just might work . What is it ? It 's ammonia . Nh-3 . Ammonia . Which was on dad 's shirt , which he used to keep his prints off the gun safe , did n't he ? And then he called his wife from the car . Phone records confirm he made a call from his cell . Honey , can you check the gun safe ? I think I might have left it open . Dad comes back home at 11:45 a.m . Opens the gun safe without leaving his prints , and takes out the shotgun . We ca n't prove that he told his wife to close the safe . Yes , but any plan proves premeditation , and that means he knew exactly what he was doing . That 's what it means . What do you have ? Guess what Jason Caplin 's claiming ? Postpartum psychosis . By proxy . First , he frames his wife for murder , and then he co-opts her illness . What a stellar human being . Well , the important thing now ... is that she really knows what happened .

Internal bleeding commences at hour 12 ... and by hour 36 ... the subject completely bleeds out ... but with the Mutaba virus and other level fours ... the kill rate is 90% . And , may I add , an airborne virus ... coupled with a pinprick in your glove or a faulty seal ... sends you into the slammer , and from there ... it 's an express straight to the submarine . Lights . Thank you for the safety review , Dr . Reilly . You misled them back there . You and  Florence did develop a vaccine for the Cahuenga virus . We got lucky on that . But with Ebola or Mutaba ... Well , I have to keep ' em honest . I 'm sorry about Dr . Florence . You must miss him . - Very much . - From what I understand , Dr . Florence was a family man . - Hardly the type tojust up and leave . - He was a good man . Of all people , you two should know that ... awful things swirl beneath the healthiest of exteriors ... rather than being at home . This is an airborne Level 4 virus . Let 's be on our toes . Commencing phase two dissection . We are 72 hours after expiration by Mutaba strain " B , " subject 247 . - Walter . - Good God . - Decon ! - Come on . Let 's move it . Go ! -  - Okay , let 's remain calm . Proceed with decon shower . - Coming through . -  Stay calm . You 'll be fine . - Code denied . - Damn it ! The code is n't working ! Here , let me .  Code accepted . - Get the glove off . - Inoculate . Hurry up . No skin breaks . The blood must 've been from the sample . Well done , everybody . Everything by the numbers . We 'll review the security tape tomorrow . Well , you handled that simulation as if it were completely real ,  . I do n't want anybody near the slammer unless they have to be . - It 's your funeral . - No , it 's his .  's the only person that has the access code to the slammer ? And the submarine . Oh ,  . How 's my goddaughter ? About to turn six , but she thinks she 's 16 . I hope you can make it to her party . I would n't miss it for the world . I 've proceeded with the autopsy on the monkey . Look at the liver . Mush . This virus has mutated . We 'll finish this first thing Monday . Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . It 's been ... Oh , my God ... 33 years since my last confession . I have betrayed a friend . Then you must seek his forgiveness . Mm-mmm . He has shut me out . You 're troubled by something else . Look at the liver . -  Mush . This virus has mutated . - Mm-hmm . It 's like the Cahuenga virus , but worse . This is a Level 5 virus . What the hell have you done ? You made Ebola look like the flu . - I 've been working on it , genetically . - No , you 've been playing God . We got ta shut down this project now . - I 'm destroying it . - You can't . - Yes , I can . - I wo n't let you . Let go of my air hose ! - I wo n't let you . - Let go of my air hose ! - I wo n't let you . - Let go of my air hose ! Let go of my air hose ! My God , Walter , you 've killed me ! Quick , into the decon shower . -  - The lab is full of the virus . Stay calm . Do n't panic . Hello ,  . I was afraid I 'd find you here .   Hansel , you are driving me nuts . ! Shut up . ! Interesting interpretation . -  -  You suck . ! You 're a polite neighbor ,  ... but I fear the cultural dwarves are right . I 'm terrible . It takes a long time to master music , Ben . A lifetime would not be long enough for me . My music kills plant life . I 'm Salieri to Mozart ,  . I curse God for bestowing me with mediocre ability .  What are these ? Trifles , larks . Pointless exercises . Did you make these ? Yes . Ben , these are exquisite . Your compliment is appreciated ,  . But , art it is not . Art is many things . Some choose a brush , some a bow ... some a pen , and some ... choose glass . What do you mean ? Maybe the way you create is through these pieces rather than that .   Sydney , I 'm scared . I ca n't do this .  You have to ,  . There 's smoke . People are screaming . Sydney , they 're burning ! They 're burning ! Make it stop ! Make the burning stop ! -  ! - Make it stop ! No , go away ! Leave me alone ! It 's all right ,  . It 's all right . Aah ! It 's all over ,  . It 's all right . - I want my daddy . - The code word makes it stop ,  . - You did n't use the code word we came up with . - I said , I want my dad . Let me .  , remember . When you 're doing the simulation and you become frightened ... and wan na stop , say , " Refuge . " All right ? Mm-hmm ? Refuge .    He contacted me . No secrets . Dr .  , do you have a minute ? What 's up ? - What do you make of this ? - Hmm ? Well , let 's see . Liquefication of organs , blood secretion through skin pores , loss of hair . Looks like an advanced version of Mutaba . That 's what I thought until I found this . I 've never seen this before . Did you cross-check it ? Against every sample on record . There 's over 3,000 on record . It did get a little tedious after the first 800 . -  -  My God .  , this is worse than any Level 4 I 've ever seen . - It 's a Level 5 . - What ? There 's a Level 5 here ? It 's a sample off a body in the submarine . Wait . H-How did you get in the submarine ? Only Gar ... Go . Go .  has the code .  was working on some research . l-I do n't know what . What else did  Florence tell you ? How 'd you know  was the source ? Besides  , he was the only person ... that knew everything that was going on here . What else did he tell you ? That  was working on some radical mutations of a Level 5 . He said it started out good , but it got corrupted .  said God would never forgive him ... if he let this project continue . Well , unfortunately forJon Florence ... he never had the chance to stop it . Oh , my God .  Mush . This virus has mutated . Mm-hmm . We 'll finish this first thing Monday .  I 'm guessing between the knob , the mouthpiece and the city water you 're drinking ... there 's enough germs to kill a cockroach . Dr . Reilly . Hi . Yeah , you 're probably right . I deal with the germs I can , but something tells me ... Look , l-I do n't know what you mean . Are you gon na make me enhance the image so I can see your face ? Do you know what it 's like not being able to sleep ? You 'd be surprised . I watched a man beg for his life . He begged to see his wife and kid again , and I ... I ... I did n't help him . I know  Florence got infected , I know his body 's in the submarine ... and I know that you helped  doctor this tape . But what I ca n't figure out is why . Because it was my fault , that 's why . l-I was working late likeJon and Dr .  ... and l-I saw  come into the slammer ... and he-he ... he looked so frightened . The decon shower lost pressure ... and that is my job to make sure that it does n't . That-That is my job , Dr . You know , l-I have never seen a virus do what it did to him , or so quickly . And that 's why you wo n't go past Level 2 anymore . It 's just thatJon ... he begged me to get his wife and kid ... and-and  ...  told me to keep it quiet . He said that ... that the authorities would have to be called ... and that they would shut down the facility ... and that more lives would be lost because of my error .  Florence did not die because of you or the decon shower . He died because Walter  murdered him . Hello , Butcher Bob 's ? I 'd like to order a dozen pig livers , please . Yes , a dozen . Say " cheese . " Good morning , class . Today 's lesson takes us into the fascinating world of cockroaches . - Walter ? - Yes ? It 's  . I 've made a very interesting discovery that I think you should check out ... but I think I found a vaccine for Mutaba . - I'll-I 'll meet you in the lab in an hour ,  . - Perfect . What have you got ? Where 'd you get the sample ? From this liver . My God , man ! It 's an airborne virus ! Walter , your air hose . - Hit the alarm . ! Help me . ! -  Help me ! God ! Oh ! There 's pressure failure in the decon line ! Well , you 'd better get into the slammer , sir .  Code accepted . Where is everybody ? Where are the doctors ? Baytos ! There 's nobody here , sir . - I sent them all home . -  , you 've killed me ! Relax , Walter . I told you . I made a little discovery . It 's a derivative cross between your Cahuenga virus and the Rift Valley strain . An anti-virus . It shuts your strain down . Give it to me , please . Like you helped  Florence ... by exposing him to a Level 5 without any cure ? Who the hell are you ? Well , I sure as hell am not Florence Nightingale . But , then again , neither are you . How long , Walter ? How long beforeJon Florence started to show symptoms ? How long before the internal bleeding started ? How long before his brain tissues started to leak into his ears ? How long before his internal organs started to liquefy ? How long , Walter ? - Give me that syringe . - Why ?  Florence never had this option . Why should you ? -  , it was an accident . - He knew he was going to die . And I 'll bet the last thing he wanted to do was just to see his family one more time ... to say good-bye to his wife and to his child ... and you ruined his family 's as well . - That is no accident . - All right , I did it . I admit it . I killed him ! The-The research was very valuable . - Please , give me the vaccine ! - All right , Walter . But I will warn you . It 's only sugar water . Sugar water ? I do n't know how to make a vaccine . You see , I 'm not really a virologist . - The truth is , this place gives me the creeps . - What ? You can check out anytime you like , but you can never leave . No ! No ! Do n't leave me !  !   . ! Come back here . !  . ! Wait , don't . ! Please , do n't leave me here . ! Please , don't . ! Help ! Help ! - Are n't you gon na tell him you did n't really infect him ? -  Nah . ! Somebody , help . ! - After the police get this . - Help me . ! Oh , no . ! God . ! Oh , God , help me . ! Come back . ! Come back . !  . !  . ! - What is that smell ? - I ca n't smell . Go left . You take that room . Good morning , class . Today 's lesson takes us into the fascinating world of cockroaches . - Nothing . He 's gone . - Yes , but not forgotten . -  - This is a bug motel . When the hormones off a roach 's body ... which is the wet stuff you just walked through ... combines with the sticky stuff inside of the box , which you are standing in ... it forms a bond ... which is stronger than epoxy . Welcome to the world 's largest bug motel . You son of a bitch . Enjoy your stay . Class dismissed . I 'm stuck . No one at the Centre would 've ever known what this meant . I had to see you face-to-face . Did Miss Parker take the bait ? Presumably . I have to ask you for something . You 're in no position to ask me for anything . Not even your forgiveness ? - What ? - For keeping you in the Centre . For the lies all these years . Did you send me this ? No , I did not . Parker did with your name on it . - What is it ? - Reminders . Issues I must take up with myself ... God ... and with you . - It 's too late . - I come to you with an olive branch . All right . You want my forgiveness ? Then tell me what happened to my mom and dad . I ca n't . I do n't know the truth . Then you and the Centre will never get me back . And I ca n't forgive you , Sydney . I ca n't forgive myself . We received the extraordinary glass sculpture you made ... and we 'd like to set up a time for you to meet with our merchandise coordinator . We have next Wednesday available ... Thank you ... for everything . Where will you go now ? I 'm starting a new job . You 've got roaches ?

Ajax , why do you keep yelling " ow " ? Dad , Mambo 's kicking me . I am not . You 're kicking yourself . Say , you 're right . Why would I do that ? Sometimes I 'm so stupid I could kick myself . Ow . Can it , all of you ! The whole point of this vacation is to stop all the fighting we 've been doing lately . We 're not even there yet and we 're already squabbling like a bunch of Hungarians . Aunt Bernice , it 's been four years since Zsa Zsa rear-ended you . Let it go . Did n't I give you boys what you 've always wanted ? A visit to a real Indian reservation . Wow , will we learn all about genuine Native American traditions ? Ajax , you can always learn something if you 're not careful . Duckman , I thought Cornfed was supposed to be following us .  Yeah , I managed to lose him about an hour ago . DUCKMAN : Well , here we are . I should have known this pagan pleasure palace would be your idea of a genuine Native American reservation . Bernice , for shame . Supporting the mystifyingly legal ventures of our Injun brethren is a way of atoning for making them pick all that cotton . Dad , Indians never picked cotton . Then what the hell 's their beef ? Ah !  Wow , no wonder aggregate gains in leisure and gaming sectors soared eight percent , defying NASDAQ trends .  Sorry to interrupt your grotesque cultural stereotype , but may I help you with something ? Finding an exit , perhaps , or showing you how soap works ? Do n't flip your wigwam , Big Chief Fancypants . We 're checking in . You , uh ... you see we , uh ... have a ... reservation !  Reservation !    If I slap my knee any harder , it will be a wounded knee . Hey , we left our bags outside because we did n't want to " totem " around . Totem around ... Here 's my imitation of Geronimo jumping out of a plane . Me ! Me .  Do n't worry if you do n't get them all , buck . I got a million of them . Oh , goodie . Blaze the trail , Tonto . This is going to be the bestest vacation ever . Oh , dear , sir . I 'm afraid that ... I 'll just bet you 're afraid , Red . All these white people must give you flashbacks to the scalping the redskins took at Little Bighorn . But do n't worry , we 're just here to stuff our pale faces so scout us a table and rev up the chuck wagon . BERNICE : Duckman ! ALL : Dad ! What ? They like when you steal . They 're a very giving people . That 's how we get the phrase " Indian giver . " See ? You 're learning already . Hello , I 'm Thomas , I 'll be your server . Let me tell you about our special tonight . You begin with an appetizer of grilled leeks with saffron ... Yeah , get me a tumbler of Wild Turkey and keep them coming . As for dinner , let 's make this simple . Country-fried steak and fish sticks for everybody . Through the giggling and the peek-a-boo and the patty-cake . Through interminable readings from Deepak Chopra and Life 's Little Instruction Book . But then , during the Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat medley , I just snapped . Glove compartment ? Tail pipe . I gave the valet ten bucks to wait a while before he pries them out . Shrewd . Duckman , why is that woman staring at us and taking notes ? Guilty .  Please forgive me . I do n't mean to intrude but I have been watching you . I 'm Dr . Susan Fox . The renowned family therapist and best-selling author ? Uh , yes . Forgive me if I 'm being presumptuous but presumption is just ... well , something I do . Not your problem . Fox ? You see , in my landmark book , The Ties That Divide - - now available wherever quality paperbacks are sold -- I devise the Fox scale of dysfunctional crisis . This group scores an 87 . Is that bad ? Well , the Jacksons only scored 61 .  The good news is it 's not too late . I came here for some peace and quiet to write my new book which will finally offer hope to agoraphobics but you people offer a much more exciting opportunity . With your permission I 'd like to work with you and make that my book . What about the agoraphobics ? They 're not going anywhere .  Well , then , what do you say ? I could save your family . Hold your horses , Dr . Fox , medicine woman . What makes you think we 're dysfunctional ? Look , Dad , I 'm eating more French fries than ever . Love me , Dad . Love me . Case closed . Waiter , pow-wow now . This steak is raw . It 's got more pink than Showgirls . Wrangle this slab back to the flame , okay , babe ? Come on , move . Hey ... yup . They 're such children .             Bon appetit . Oh , yeah ... oh , yeah . Oh , now we 're talking . Mm-hmm-mm , whoa . It 's like a thousand tiny taste sensations . See ? It takes an American to get things done . Well ... I ... really have to go now . But I 'll reserve the mezzanine conference room in case you change your mind . I 'll be there tomorrow at 10:00 . I hope you 'll all be there , too . This may be your last hope to survive the hideous doom to come . We 'd learn a lot about ourselves . And avoid the disaster and tragedy the doctor spoke of . There is nothing wrong with this family that some old fashioned belt-beatings would n't solve . No more . No shrinks ! It 's shrinks that made this country touchy-feely . It 's shrinks that blab and blab on Sally Jesse so the teenage nymphomaniacs ca n't get a word in edgewise . It was shrinks that made me and Mom stop bathing together when I was 15 , just when I needed her love the most . No shrinks , and that 's final . There 's nothing wrong with this family . Hey , uh , waiter , uno mas . DR . FOX : This family will self-destruct . BERNICE : We need help . CHARLES : Please , Dad . AJAX : Love me , Dad . WAITER : ... grilled leeks with saffron . ALL : You should 've taken us to therapy .  Yikes ! That 's less than ideal . All : Yay .  I 'm sure Duckman will be here soon . Want to bet he 's doing something to further embarrass and humiliate us ? Mambo , you ca n't be sure of that . Hey ! That fountain out there is full of change . There are dimes in here . Duckman , let me start by saying ... No , let me tell you , Madame D.A . , exactly what 's on the table . I give you give the shooter you plead me down to man one . I get eight plus time served and I 'm out in three . Do we have a deal or not ? Oh , uh , Dr . Fox . I 'm sorry , I thought this was my 4:00 .  Forget I said anything . I 'm very proud of all of you for coming . You 've got a blue ribbon pair of muskmelons and Duckman 's hungry ! Perhaps we should shoot for 90% honesty . You 're the doc . Let me sum up your situation in terms you 'll understand . We have a father figure who is too self-obsessed to be a real father . Ding-ding-ding ! Who is ... me ! Duckman , this is n't a game . Heh ... gyp . We have a domineering mother figure who delights in cruelly emasculating the men in her life . Not just the men . A boy with an eating disorder totally disconnected from the world . And two hyper-intelligent boys who feel disenfranchised from the family . We 're like minor underwritten characters in our own lives . Cornfed , the de facto uncle , is a codependent with low self-esteem . I think she 's right , but what do I know ? And you two are ... What are you two again ? BOTH : We 're Mr . Duckman 's assistants . Hah ! Used to be , Mambo , but thanks to right-wing , religious nutballs it 's now a sacred duty to God and America to disobey whatever laws you do n't agree with . Which reminds me , if any G-men come sniffing around , we do n't have automatic weapons stockpiled in the basement , okay ? But we do n't . Ri-i-ight . Charles , how does your dad make you feel when he says things like that ? Well , ashamed ... repulsed , scornful . Just like me and my dad . Mambo , what would be your vision of the ideal family ? One where intelligence was rewarded . And where sensitive souls are cultivated instead of squashed . Shut up , or you 'll end up like those poets I cold-cocked last week . Ajax , what about you ? What 's your vision of the perfect family ?  Oh , wow . We finally have the proof that Joe and I have been looking for . You 're our long-lost brother . Mmm ..  Uh-oh . He 's in Nantucket again . Perhaps we should come back to him . Well , are we running the session now , Mister Psycholology ? I sense you harbor some resentment toward Cornfed . It 's not true . You resent his competence , do n't you ? No . Open up-- I got Karen Black off cough syrup . I can get you to admit you resent Cornfed . Yes ! It 's true , it 's true !  Wow , Mr . Duckman , a breakthrough . Thanks to Dr . Fox , and let 's not forget the soul-enriching Native American atmosphere . Let us salute our Indian brothers . Okay , I 'll start with my tribute to Ed Ames .  No , please ! Hostility here could reverse the healing process . Nice one , you pan-fried pony pellet . I got a hatchet with your name on it , too , stay-puffed marshmallow butt . I ca n't listen to them fight anymore . It 's go time , baby . Your emotional systems are very raw right now . Count to ten before ... One-two-four-six-ten ! I want out of this family ! Me , too-- I 've had it up to here . Point at my chin , Charles . I 'm busy shaking my fist . Point at your own chin ! Fine ! From now on I want nothing to do with any of you . I have no friends , I have no sister-in-law , i ... Doc , quick , lend me your jacket . I ... have ... no sons ! Do n't give in to rage . Hah ! You 're complaining ? I 'm the one who sacrificed my life cleaning your post-binge filth , vacuuming up dandruff the size of chickpeas putting up with visits at all hours from Captain Moron , here . Do n't take this the wrong way but get bent , you lard-bottomed freak . People , please ! ALL : I want out ! Helen , keep Joe busy while Brian and I sneak Antonio 's goat on the plane . Okay , okay , this is not good . We must solve this or your family will be destroyed . Now , a good start , Duckman , would be for you to come out from under those chairs . They 're not chairs , they 're a fort . I call it " Fort Duckman , " and only Duckman 's allowed in , and nobody 's allowed in who does n't like Duckman who says bad things about Duckman or treats Duckman bad ! What are you changing your name to ? Uh , did somebody hear a voice ? Cornfed , I sense you have issues . Oh , I have issues . Like the time he had a big date so he made me miss my mother 's funeral to cauterize his lucky goiter . And the time he got drunk and gave my phone number to Karen Black . Damn you to hell , Tony Danza ! Damn you to hell ! Duckman , how does that list of , uh ... atrocities honestly make you feel ? Like firing up the charcoal and popping a jug of open pit . You and what United Nations peacekeeping force ? Somewhere there 's got to be therapy you 'll respond to . Uh , like , like foam bats .  Oh , or , uh ... role-playing . Yes ! All right , then , role-playing it is . Now , the idea behind the , uh ... Cornfed , what are you doing ? I 'll be playing the role of Hal Holbrook in an excerpt from my popular one-man show Cornfed Pig is Hal Holbrook is James Whitmore is Mark Twain Tonight ! The L.A Weekly called it " a foot-stomping , rollicking peek at America 's dark underbelly . " Let 's just ... stick to people in the room . Now you 're going to get it . Take your best shot . Stay focused ! Cornfed , tell us about yourself . Hi , I 'm Cornfed . I think I 'm so smart because I know everything and I 've had a lot of jobs so I 'm really cool and my slop do n't stink . Good start . Now , Cornfed , why do n't you give it a try ? You be Duckman . Well , I 'll try .  : Stuff it up your spinach spout , you ham-handling hee-haw ! I 've only got five minutes till pep squad practice is over and with any luck , I 'll be boom-bahing sis before lights out ! I 'm going to shine the old shank scrim the old shaw , black the old lab , et-a-cetera .  Color me horny , Corny ! My pump is primed ! Hoo-hoo ! No ! Let 's not make this all about Duckman ! Yeah . Let 's face it , I 'm always available always willing , and I really save money with that five-finger discount .  We 're supposed to find common ground ! We found it - - we all think Duckman 's the problem ! Yeah , but ... but ... Snappy comeback .  Duckman , do you want to say anything ? I do n't know . Whatever . Duckman , I 've never met anyone like you , and I do n't know you well but this much I do know about you - - you 'll fight to have your steak just right , you 'll fight not to have to wear a jacket , and you 've fought like hell over a hundred times today to get a peek down my blouse . Now you have to fight for yourself , because if everyone thinks you 're bad the only way to convince them otherwise is to share how you feel from the heart . You mean ... like O.J . You got it , doc .  Wait . You 're all so good at playing me but what role should I play , huh ? I could be Bernice . That 's right , Duckman . Then I can undercut your authority , constantly humiliate you in public , teach your children to have no respect for you and devalue your memories of your wife . Or I could be Charles and Mambo flaunting the fact I 'm smarter than you , treating you like an idiot because you do n't know anything about quantum split cyclamates - - whatever . Why should you act like a father when I never act like sons ? I could be Fluffy and Uranus and force my views on you . Never respect your right to have your own beliefs . Or I could be Cornfed , always reminding you who 's the expert . I 'd rather keep subtly blowing my own horn than teaching you to be a better detective ... or a better friend .  I think Ajax has taught us something here today . For better or worse you 're the only family you 've got so make the most of it . You 're right , doctor . Actually , this experience has been ... cleansing . I feel like you do after a long , hot shower . I 'll take your word for that part but I do feel better - - thanks , doc . This is why I got into psychology - - to find complex answers to people 's real problems . Of course , then I found out where the big money was - - making up problems and giving people easy answers to them . So I 'm going to forget this whole thing happened . I already have . Let 's go , gang ! *  Duckman , remove your hand . Heh-heh-heh . Sorry . *

The day has finally come . Perhaps the proudest day in the history of the Bundy household . I want the whole family to share in this . Buck , you ready , boy ? Calm down , Buck . - Where 's Mom ? - She 's out shopping . Good . Then the whole family is here . Man , what a day . After all the praying , the dreaming the saving of every penny , the Bundys have finally arrived . Today we get cable TV . Yes . Yes . - Can I get a " whoa cable " ? - Oh , yeah . Whoa , cable ! All right . Now , kids , the cable should come on any minute . But to make every day our birthdays , I have a very special gift . May I present the Cadillac of television controls : The Channelmaster 2000 . Man , this baby can do anything . Changes channels backwards , changes them forward . It 's like having a wife crouching by the TV except I would n't mind sleeping with this . And it 's got a half-a-mile radius . Why , I could control Marcie 's TV sitting right here by my command post . Matter of fact ... - Oh , Dad , you should n't do that . - Oh , Dad . All right , enough frivolity . Kids , man the cable book . I am turning on the TV . What 's this ? It 's the Japanese Channel , Dad . - What 's this ? - It 's the Polka Channel . - What 's this ? - That 's the Stained Glass Network . There does n't seem to be much on cable either . Kids , fear not . We still have 78 more channels to go . Well , what 's wrong , Dad ? I just never thought I could be so happy sitting next to you two . Well , Dad you 've been sitting there for 36 hours straight now . I will not give up . I am paying $60 a month to be entertained and I will be entertained if I never enjoy another day in my life . Oh , now , this is better . Yeah , here 's the Sally Struthers Whining Channel . Oh , look at the starving children . Boy , man , now we 're having fun . And stay tuned for Cagney Lacey . Oh , Daddy , I have been so wronged . You have been so wronged ? Look what I 'm spending 60 bucks a month for . Well , at least I ... At least I got this . Now I feel lucky . Today on the Medical Channel , Doctor Bob removes an ovary . Well , you may as well bore me with your problems . Okay . Well , my whole modelling class went down to be on public-access television . You know , for our poise-and-personality tests . But did I get a turn ? Ask me if I got a turn . Ask me . Just go ahead and ask me . No , I did not . And you know why ? Because my teacher , Mrs . Jones , does n't like me . Because one day she wore a pair of jeans that said " Guess " and I guessed size 42 . Instead of giving me a prize , she cops an attitude . Anyway ... So every girl got to be on TV but then they ran out of time before my turn . Now I do n't even have a tape for when it comes time for my grade . Now , come on , Kel . There 's got ta be plenty of videotapes of you lying around . I wish I was dead . What should I do ? Well , honey , I 'm glad you 've come to me . - Because I have plenty ... - Look , Dad . Look .

So we 've been playing out my role as Mommy in bed . Sometimes he 's a bad boy and needs a good spanking . Well , I guess I was wrong . Marcie 's not gon na be on . As a matter of fact , he used to have a little problem with , shall we say , hang time . But I told him not to worry , it 's not him . " I just have some banking problems on my mind . " Hey , how 'd she get on TV anyway ? It 's public access . Anyone with $35 and a pack of lies to tell about her husband can get on . - Here we go . - Can I have $35 to be on TV , please ? Honey , we 're not millionaires . Now , honey , I know you 're disappointed . You see what I mean ? Oh , my gosh . And stay tuned for The All White Guys Slam Dunk Contest . Dad , you have n't left the house in three days now . Not that it would matter if you lost your job but it 's embarrassing having your old Dodge parked out front all day . I mean , what if people start thinking it 's mine ? I am not getting off the couch until I find something to watch . Well , there you go , Roger Ebert 's Dance Party . It 's almost time for Kelly 's debut on the Public Access Channel . Oh , good . That wo n't bring any more shame to the family . What do you think she 'll do ? A scholarly discussion of Ezra Pound 's poetry ? Or getting her hair stuck in her mouth and chasing it around the way a dog chases its tail ? Like a dog . Everyone expected a piece of fluff , but we wanted to do something important something the youth of America could relate to . You know , issue stuff . Today 's topic : Cute butts and the men they 're attached to . Hi , welcome to my show . I 'm Kelly . Now , as you all know , it costs $35 to put on a show so I asked my Dad for the money , but he 's a shoe salesman . So I had to turn to my unemployed teenage friends for the money . I just plugged you , Daddy . Yes , you did , pumpkin . And now I would like to introduce my guests . Cyndy , she gave $10 . As did Roberta . And Samantha , who 's rich because her dad knocks off convenience stores gave $14.50 . And my very special guest , who gave an eye-popping 50 cents Mr . Vinnie Verducci . I mean , say I pull up to some chick . Now , I 'm doing a conservative 75 in a 30-mile-an-hour zone so of course I only have seconds to seduce her with my eyes . You see this look ? How are they supposed to see it with Tupperware strapped to my head ? I 'd look like that dork the Rocketeer for God 's sakes which , by the way , was death at the box office . Now , I 've fallen on my head 100 times and you do n't hear me crying , " I ca n't think . I ca n't think . " What were we talking about ? Men 's butts . I 'd like to see them try and get a helmet on my butt . Thank you , Vinnie . Your 50 cents is up . Get out . And now I would like to introduce our band : Joanie and the Slashettes ! One , two , three , four . Soda ! Now , as I recall , we were right in the middle of men 's butts . Cyndy who do you think has the cutest butt ? I do . No , we 're talking about men 's butts . Mel Gibson . Lethal Weapon ... Okay . Okay , girls . Let 's get serious . Two , three , four . Serious ! Which brings us to a tragic story . A girl ... We 'll call her Jeannie . - Got a bad perm . I know that this must be very hard for you , Jeannie . Thank you for being here today . Now what went through your mind when you first saw your perm ? I screamed . I cried . I ran the gamut . You poor thing . Remember , folks , it 's up to you to help . You can make a difference . Phone your pledges in now . Call 555-PERM . Ladies and gentlemen this could happen to you ! And now another number from our band . Two , three , four . We 're gon na talk about girls that we do n't like . The Vital Social Issues ' N Stuff with Kelly slut of the week is : Two , three , four . Slut ! Thank you . Is Vicki . Now , not only is Vicki too cheap to give $1.50 to be on the show but she also borrows clothes and does n't give them back . And if she does she does n't give them back with the hanger . - She 's trash . - She 's dirt . She gave me this perm . So for all these things we all give you , Vicki , a big get-a-yeast-infection salute . And now on to career talk . - What ? - Ask me the question . Oh , right . Say , Kelly we understand that you go to modelling school . Well , I 'm glad that you brought that up , Roberta . My classmates are a bunch of skanks . And my teacher stinks . But I 'm on now , are n't I ? Well , I can see by the clock on the wall that it 's ... Five , 10 , 15 , 20 ... But before we go I would like to do a number with the band that I wrote myself . Ladies . Two , three , four . I 'm on TV and you are not Drop dead , Mrs . Jones Die ! Size 42 Two , three , four . So , what 'd you think ? I mean , it was great , right ? Well , honey we 're gon na have a little meeting over here . Kelly , you go over there . Now , she tried really hard . - We ca n't hurt her feelings . - Yeah . We got ta think of something nice to say to her . How about , " At least they did n't send the Energizer Bunny through the show " ? Let 's be nice to her this one time . Now ... I know . Honey , we have something to tell you . Well , I have something to tell you too . They love me . I 'm gon na be on every week . So , what were you gon na say ? Dad 's dramatic reading in a pathetic attempt to get on Kelly 's show . Take six . Thank you , Daddy . Thank you . Honey , now to help you choose do you think I should do " The Girl from Ipanema " again ? No . Please , no , Daddy . Now , listen , I appreciate whatever it was that you were doing but the station wants a show with me and the girls . And I 'm really having fun . Why ca n't you just be proud of me ? Well , I am proud of you , pumpkin . I hope the show does even better so that I can be more proud of you . Little untalented and ungrateful flash in the pan . Out of the way ! Oh , boy , that was painful . Kel you got ta picture the whole thing in a pair of Speedos . That 's what we think . Tell us what you think on the subject . ; Briefs or boxers ? Do n't let it be his decision . Dad , it 's been three weeks and Kelly 's show is still on . I think it 's taken off . Can it be that we were wrong ? Can this be a success ? Well , son , I do n't know anything about TV do n't know anything about the world do n't know anything about Siegfried Roy 's home life . But I do know that Kelly is a Bundy . And there 's no way in the world a Bundy will succeed at anything . Does that make you feel better , son ? Oh yeah , Dad . I 'm high as a kite now . Good . Because any time now , she 's gon na come through that door crying : " Daddy , Daddy , it 's all over . People realize my show stinks . But now it 's too late and I failed . " Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Well , pumpkin , what could have happened ? They contacted me down at the station . And ? A real network wants to put my show on prime time . - I 'm going to Hollywood ! - What ? - Yes ! Yes ! - Hollywood ? Get on out of here ! 
@@5224041 NARRATOR : Previously on NYPD Blue : You 're with him on the job and all night . Pull the trigger . Did you take him out ? I know Marino 's business and cops who are on the take . - So my dad 's on a list . - These are wrong cops . They 'll say I took money from Marino . I 'm glad they never reached out to you . LICALSl : He 's dead . KELLY : Your father ? Cleaning his gun . KELLY : How come you got a gun ? - Gun ? In your briefcase . I 'm glad I shot him . I liked it . I 'm your friend . I hope you feel the same . - I do . - I have n't made many friends here . Susan , this is Detective John Kelly . KELLY : Hi , ma'am . - How do you do ? - How 'd you get the eye ? - My husband beat me up . KELLY : Good morning . MAID : Good morning . KELLY : Mr . Wagner . I wo n't be working for you anymore . I 'm sorry . You and Susan were getting along . Scheduling problems ? Not really . I just do n't want to take your money . Why 's that ? This way , if you keep beating her up , I can do something about it . - Are you working for her ? - Just the police department . Then you 'll consider this situation 's more complicated ... ... thanyou'vebeenled tounderstand . Nothing complicated about those bruises on your wife 's face . You are beyond your depth , Detective Kelly . - Our conversation is over . - I 'm done too . Just to let you know that if you hit her again ... ... you'regonnabe sorry you ever met me . True Confessions MAN : Detective . - What ho . SIPOWICZ : What ho . KELLY : What 's going on in there ? - Walker just caught a case . He 's voicing some reservations about me working backup . I need to win back my colleagues ' trust . I 've got to exhibit a positive approach , even with this dim bulb . Robbery , double homicide , liquor store on James Street . - Wan na give me a hand ? - Sure . Give me . Our pleasure . Here 's the address . I 'll see you over there . That was positive , was n't it ? " Our pleasure . " Fair . Should I say , " Our pleasure , rooty-toot-toot " ? - Can I talk to you , detective ? KELLY : Yeah . I 'll see you outside , all right ? - You go to your dad 's services ? - Just got back . - How 's your mother holding up ? - Okay . Yeah . - Thank you for being there for me . - It 's all right . - I do n't want it to end . - Let 's not talk here . - We can make it work . I got ta go , all right ? WITNESS 1 : Walked in the store behind these guys . This guy comes out from the back room with a gun ... ... andhemadeusall lie on our stomachs . - Did you get a look at him ? - Pretty good . He was a white guy , tall , about 50 years old . - I got a real good look at his gun . WITNESS 2 : He had a black trench coat . He was like 6 ' 3 " , 6 ' 4 " . He was a good size . Any marks on his face or hands ? Any facial hairs ? He had a mustache and smelled like he 'd been drinking . He stood over us . That 's when I heard the click from the gun over my head . - Kelly . White , 45 or so , 6 feet tall ? - Yeah . Let 's get them to precinct . Have them look at pictures . - Here 's licenses from the cars outside . - Okay . We do n't have to hold hands , but do n't talk to me like I 'm the laundry boy . - You gave me licenses , I said okay . - Okay , fine , it 's my mistake . You got a minute , Kelly ? I 'm not taking any crap from your fat friend . - Give him a square shot . - I 'll give him the shot he earns . If that drunk screws up my case -- He has n't had a drink in two months so shove that attitude up your ass . This something the whole class can appreciate ? We 're done . Let 's ride over to the precinct house and make a photo ID . OFFICER 1 : Hey , detective . - Hey . OFFICER 2 : We 'll take you upstairs and show you some pictures . Mrs . Wagner . - How 's the eye ? - It 's fine . Please do n't quit , Mr . Kelly . You do n't need a bodyguard . Your problem is a domestic situation . If your husband hits you again , file a criminal complaint ... ... ormoveoutonhim . Do n't stay in that big apartment and take it ... ... ortalktheway you did ... ... whichsoundedlikeyou were soliciting me to commit a crime . When I wished something would happen to him , I was upset . Maybe I misunderstood . But a lot of women with husbands like yours ca n't help themselves . You can . - You can make a choice . Do it . - You 're indulging a prejudice . Affluence does n't always purchase opportunity . OFFICER : Take a look at these . - Hey , Sipowicz . - Yeah . My witness ID 'd this guy . Two priors for armed robbery . Show your people . Wait . This guy 's 5 ' 9 " . People look taller from the ground . Show them the photograph . SIPOWICZ : New faces . No . SIPOWICZ : Take your time . WALKER : Look at these carefully now . No . Kelly . I got a positive ID from one witness . His name 's Coleman . He has the right priors . Sipowicz thinks he 's too short . No , let 's pick him up . Maybe he was wearing lifts . Bensonhurst . It 's a likely locale . He lives here , robs a store downtown . He 's only got ta make 1 0 subway transfers . Maybe he had business downtown then did the store . Maybe his doctor 's down on James Street . The one who gives him hormone injections to make him 6 ' 3 " before the job ... ... thenshrinkhim to his normal 5 ' 9 " right afterward . So , what 's going on with you and that girl ? - Which girl ? - The one we do n't talk about . Licalsi . - Nothing 's going on . I 'd take a shot at her . Nothing 's going on . And here 's the guy , Andy . If he did n't do the liquor store , maybe he did something else . Look at this . Our witness said he had a mustache . People shave . - Police . Are you Howard Coleman ? COLEMAN : Yeah . We need to talk about your activities . I had no activities . I went to the drugstore . WALKER : You were seen on James Street in Manhattan . - I was n't there . Get off my property . - We 're taking you in . You better have a warrant , or get away . - What 's the matter ? - Go back in . Take your medicine . WALKER : Come on . SIPOWICZ : Hey ! Hey ! WOMAN : Daddy ! - Stop it ! Daddy ! You 're hurting him ! KELLY : Stay down . Calm down . - Now you 're under arrest , pal ! KELLY : Take it easy . Daddy ! - Where 'd you get the money ? - I bet a horse . KELLY : Which horse ? Where ? - At Aqueduct . I do n't remember the name . We do n't think your intent was murder . What happened ? Someone got violent with you ? - What 's your name again ? - Walker . Walker , I was never in a liquor store on James Street today . - So kiss my ass . WALKER : What if I broke your jaw ? - Make sure they 're holding me down . - Here we go . That 's it , Walker . Howard , what 's wrong with your daughter ? - What do you mean ? - You gave her medicine . - For her breathing . She 's got asthma . - My kid had that . So , what 's that supposed to do ? Make me love you ? I was hoping you 'd get some warm feelings for me . - Thanks . WOMAN : Sure . Hi . I just quit my job . What brought that about ? I was in for a cards-on-the-table conversation . " Be forthcoming about your previous work for the city . We need to know their approach on our clients ' variance applications . " I ask , " So all that stuff , how it 's me you 're interested in ... ... andnotmy contacts , all that was a crock ? " " Let 's be adults , Laura . " So I told them they could stick their job up their ass . Just your way of giving notice , huh ? - You 're not gon na say " I told you so " ? - No , not the type . - You got plans for dinner ? - You buying ? Pick you up in a couple hours . The way these lineups work , you wo n't help me any if you say : " Could be him . Maybe that 's the guy . That 's the guy . " - I understand . - Of course , if you recognize him . - Do n't say you do if you do n't . WITNESS : Right . WALKER : Now you know what I need . - It 's lineup time . Walker touched up the bull's-eye on Coleman 's forehead . Come on . Here . Take a look . WALKER : Take your time . - I see him . - Which one ? Number three . Are you sure ? WITNESS : I 'm sure . That 's the guy . I recognize him . WALKER : I like the guy . He did time for armed robbery , We got a positive ID . Plus , he had $850 in his pocket he could n't satisfactorily explain . - What do you think ? - Looks good so far . We 'll want to see if crime scene lifts prints from that store . But like he says ... . Work it out , give it to the DA .  FANCY : Lieutenant Fancy . In the future ... . - Thanks for the help . SIPOWICZ : Yeah . - I did n't mean to be so irritable . - No problem . COLEMAN : Why are you doing this to me ? WALKER : Let 's get you to court . - I got ta call my daughter . WALKER : Call her from the Tombs . - I 'm telling you , he did n't do it . KELLY : We 'll stay on it . Meanwhile , Coleman eats prison food . 4B . How 's it going ? Fine . Do you have a moment for me ? - Come on . - Several matters : First , our tenants readiness group is eager to hear your thoughts ... ... onbuildingsecurity and personal safety . Is there any advance preparation ? Will you have visual aids I could help to set up ? - I 'll just talk awhile . - Fine . I 've arranged for refreshments . The other thing , detective , concerns ... ... thefifthanniversary of my college graduation . I find looking back , leaving home , moving to New York and so forth ... ... thatgettingrobbedand beatenup and then dealing with the man ... ... ina way , taking back my citizenship ... ...  . I wonder if I could access police reports so I could write it up . - No . - No . I could n't release them . You got ta fill out an application . I feel those reports would be useful to me . Why not concentrate on your career highlights and accomplishments ? Why write about a punk who tried to rob you ? - Because it 's important to me . - You 're getting tied up in knots -- I disagree . I feel as though the scales have fallen away from my eyes . I finally understand this city , how to deal with it . How to meet it on its own terms . How to help others . How others need to be helped . This is n't High Noon . I have to say your reaction typifies ... ... Me and my haughty indifference will be at that tenant meeting . KELLY : Laurie . Laurie .  Laurie , it 's me . John . LAURA : Hi , Johnny . There 's a beer in the fridge . Okay . LAURA : I 'll just be a minute . KELLY : Can I get you a towel ? - I can get one . Thanks . KELLY : Well , I just ran out of excuses for coming in there . Since when did you ever need an excuse ? I could cook for us here . - I thought we were gon na go out . - Okay . - You 're not hungry ? - No , that 's fine . I can get work with someone I went to school with : Jimmy Craig . - James Craig who prosecutes narcotics ? - In the district attorney 's office . - You 're kidding me . - No , I 'm not kidding . - Are you nuts ? They 're scumbags . I do n't need a note from you . I am not out in the street so you can deal with creeps like that . It 's a job . I 'm not mud wrestling with them . I do n't even know if I 'll do it . But stop fantasizing about making the world safe while I stay home and bake . - I hated that when we were married . - That was just sex ? - You got in the shower . - Did you push me away ? You 're right . This has to stop . I just kept hoping that we could remain close . We 've always been best friends . - I wan na stay close . - But we ca n't . It 's too complicated . We ca n't stay inside the lines .  LAURA : Perfect . This is Detective John Kelly . 15th Squad . I have a shooting victim , DOA , at 626 Park Avenue , 12th floor . No apartment number . The whole floor is an apartment . Wan na tell me what happened ? He was drunk . We argued . In fact , we argued about you . He hit me . I got the gun from the bedroom . I told him to leave . He hit me again , and I shot him . - Where 'd you get the gun ? - He gave it to me a year ago . You went to the bedroom and got it after he struck you the first time . - Yes . - Did you warn him ? No , he went to get a drink . That 's when I got the gun . Okay , tell me again what happened when you came out of the bedroom . - I told him to leave , he hit me . - While you held the gun on him ? - Yes . - Where did he hit you ? In the face . - How many times ? - Several times . - Two , three ? - Three . Okay . Are you sure he hit you , Mrs . Wagner ? WAGNER : Yes . I 'm surprised you would ask me that question . - I do n't think you should say any more . - What do you mean ? No new marks or bruises on you . Place is clean . No sign of a struggle . No contact wounds , powder residue on the body . The way it 'd be ... - ... ifhewasshotatclose range . - I 'm telling the truth . You 're not telling the truth so please do n't say any more . - Why are you talking to me like this ? - Because I 've got to take you in . So shut up until you speak to your attorney . SIPOWICZ : Morning . FANCY : Morning . - Morning , lieutenant . FANCY : Morning , sergeant . - How you doing ? - We 're throwing a racket for Hanson . - He 's getting married . - All right , here . And that 's the guy 's daughter . You arrested my father . The detective handling that will be here . My father did n't rob that store , or shoot those people . - You sure about that ? - Yes . I can prove it . Um ... . Here , let'sgointhere . He was at home when that robbery happened . He ... . He books numbers . He 's home till the number comes up . It helps with my medical bills . - It violates his parole . - That 's why he had $850 . - Yes . - And you were with him all morning . I was at the doctor 's . I have asthma . But he was home . - That 's gon na be real helpful . - Are you going to let him go ? We 'll keep looking into things . Why ca n't you let him go ? I told you he was home . Being at the doctor , you ca n't verify your father 's whereabouts . - We got information coming in . Keep a good thought how things will work out . Come on . - Got any pets to keep you company ? - No . I 'm allergic . Uh ... . I 'm up late , so if you 're worried about anything , give me a call . SIPOWICZ : Anything about the case ? We got an anonymous tip during the night . You already know that , do n't you . - Sarge said you looked at my messages . - I glanced at it . Caller heard someone talk about pulling that job . Let 's check it out . An anonymous tip from a gin mill pay phone . Sounds very hot . We should check that bar out , see if anybody knows anything . Did you take a vow to make my life miserable ? We popped the guy who did this . I 'm going over there myself . Maybe you 'd like that . You could toss back a few shots . Who drives ? Mrs . We had to collect the crime scene report and examiner 's findings . Neither one support her account . In addition , Kelly states she made an incriminating solicitation to him . We 'll have to arraign this as a murder . I 'm not trying this case in a squad room . The absence of powder residue does not preclude a close-range discharge . Nor does failing to show signs of struggle mean it did n't happen . As far as her ostensibly soliciting Kelly to kill her husband ... ...  a jury that was an innocuous remark . So innocuous that the detective chose not to report it . - Mrs . Wagner -- - Talk only to me , Detective Kelly . Since you failed to give Mrs . Wagner her Miranda warning ... ...  is going to be admissible in court . She did n't need Miranda . She was n't a suspect . But when she became one , I advised her to keep quiet . Pump up that bill . - What do you think I should do ? - He 's not your lawyer . I can imagine something like this : Your husband came home loaded . You were afraid of a beating so you got the gun . You asked him to leave . He would n't . He started toward you . You shot him from across the room . - It 's not -- - She 's not gon na answer you . If that 's what happened , say so and a DA can write this up as manslaughter . A legal aid attorney can get you easy time ... - ... ERROR? - You 're wasting everybody 's time . KELLY : Do n't underestimate us . If you lie , we will nail you . Tell the truth and I will testify for you . That you 'd been beaten and were emotionally distraught . But this son of a bitch wants you to stick to your story . That will land you in central booking and Rikers Island . I want him out so that I can consult with my client . BARTENDER : How 's it going ? - Were you working here last night ? I come in around 11:30 . - Is this your place ? - Yeah . Night guy comes around 7 . A call was made from here last night . It may have a connection with a robbery-homicide . Somebody heard a guy talking on that phone ... ... aboutrobbingaliquorstore . BARTENDER : ls that right ? - Night guy say anything ? - Anybody talk to him about a call ? - No . Where 'd you get this information ? I 'll ask the questions . - You in here last night ? DWIGHT : Do n't involve me . Is it a crime to have a beer and read ? We 're only asking did you hear somebody shooting out their mouth . Absolutely not . I mind my own business , and I expect to be treated that way in return . SIPOWICZ : We 'll wait . - What ? That 's our guy . - Sitting by the phone ? - Yeah . - You are in warped territory . - Yeah . - You got a serious case of dick-brain . - I 'm telling you he knows something . - He 's been waiting for us to come . - Goddamn . There he is . Hey , pal ! I want to ask you a question . - What do you want ? SIPOWICZ : Just want to talk . What 's your name ? Dwight . This is like the Gestapo . Like a WWll movie . You phoned that tip in . And you 've been waiting for us to come in . - I do n't know what you 're talking about . - Listen to me now . Now , you made that call . So let 's stop kidding each other . - I do n't know anything - - SIPOWICZ : Just settle down . You 'd think a person who keeps to himself would n't get involved . Come on ! I wish he would move out . SIPOWICZ : Who ? Out of where ? - Frank Archer . Out of Delaware Arms . - On 46th ? - Yeah . Yeah , what ? Come on . He fired a gun in his room and shot a bullet into the wall . I share that wall . I have diabetes . How do you think I felt ? - What 'd he shoot the gun off for ? - Why ask me ? I was foolish enough to see if he was all right . " lt works , " he says as he walks down the hall . Drunk as a skunk . - The night before last ? DWIGHT : Yeah . Last night he walks in here being a big shot on the phone ... ... sayinghowhe robbedaliquorstore wearing a fake mustache . He saw me . He knew , he nearly put me into cardiac failure with that gun . I was a tenant here , but tonight I 'll be speaking as a police officer ... ... aboutthingsyoucan dotomake yourselves and your building safe . I have some books which talk about the locks we think are most effective ... ... andtheprecautionsyou can take entering and exiting the building . Elevators , stairs , things like that . In terms of being accosted , most of you know Mr . Goldstein ... ... recentlycurtailedthe career of a perpetrator who ... ... hadvictimized some of the tenants here . He happened to have a gun on him when the thief attempted to rob him . He used it . On that occasion , it worked . But we do n't think it 's a good idea . Our recommendation is give it up . Whatever they want . Money , jewelry , give it up . We 'll do our job . Now having said that , having given you those warnings ... ... i_want_to say , don ' tliveafraid . Do n't hide . Do n't be angry ... ... thesamewayyou would if you were victimized . It 's easy for me to stand here and tell you how to live your lives ... ... tellyounottoreact to what happens to you ... ... andI wouldneverput myselfup as an expert ... ... onhowto notholdonto things . My dad was shot down on the street , so ... ... Itendto be a little bit more careful ... ... maybea littlebit overprotective ... ...  another person 's style . Anyway , my point is that ... ... thisisyourcity . This is your city , not the bad guy 's . This is your life . So be free . Live it as free as you can . And we 'll be there for you . And we 'll try not to get in your way . Okay ? ARCHER : Quit pushing me around . - I did n't do anything . - No , you did n't . We did n't find checks endorsed to that liquor store lying on your floor . But you did n't do anything ! And you did n't puke all over my shoes and pants ! - You miserable piece of crap ! - One second , one second . Here it comes again . Here . Get him in there . - How bad you gon na make me look ? - What ? I busted the wrong guy . You got me by the balls . That 's what I 'm after . I want all the credit . I 'm hoping to make chief . You made a wrong ID , it happens . Nobody 's looking to hurt you . As far as I 'm concerned , picking up this asshole was your idea . Hit my shoes again , I 'll fracture your skull . SIPOWICZ : You got him ? - Yeah , I got him . What was that ? New suspect in that shooting . - Note his height , note the weapon . - Way to go , Andy . Yeah , anybody asks , it was Walker 's collar . Team player that I am . She wants to make a statement . I want it on record , it 's against counsel 's advice . I did not plan to kill my husband . We were extremely unhappy together . We 'd been unhappy for a long time . And I'd-- I 'd often , I suppose . I actually did wish that he would die . I remember seven times in the past few years that he beat me very badly . And I did frequently wish that he were dead ... ... orthattherelationship would be over . I said I wished he were dead ... ... andthatif I'dfoundhimdead , I 'd have been glad , relieved . But in no way was I asking Detective Kelly to kill him . Describe the events of the other night . I knew he was going to beat me because of the ... ... toneofhisvoiceand the look he had in his eyes . And I was afraid . The side of my face and ear still ached and rang ... ... fromwherehe had hit me the other night . Was it in your mind to shoot him ? No , it was not . I wanted him to leave , I just wanted him to leave me alone . I just did n't want him to hit me anymore . Then what happened ? He started toward me and I said , " Please leave . I mean it . " But he never paid any attention to me . Ever . In all the years we were together . He came forward . I told him to stop . And I kept backing up away from him . And he laughed at me . And he took a step forward and I shot him . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . KELLY : What 's that sound like ? COSTAS : Manslaughter 2 . KELLY : What kind of time ? COSTAS : That 's the judge 's decision . KELLY : What you would recommend . A guess , 3 years . - What she might suspend . Here you go . MAN 1 : Hello . SIPOWICZ : Hey . Hold that thought . HANSON : Hey . SIPOWICZ : Hey , congratulations . Yeah . - You made it . SIPOWICZ : Yeah . - I 'm over here . - Uh , no -- I just stopped in . Is Hanson gon na make it ? I saw him checking bus schedules . They do n't mean anything .

I 'd never leave you behind . Come on . It 's time to get back to the tree house . That 's why I had to talk to you this way . I finally figured out how to get back , but I 'm going to need your help . Get back from where ? Veronica , do you know where we are right now ? Ned , It does n't matter . All I know is that I 've missed you . Nothing 's been the same since you ... - since you ... - Say it . Since I died . I really do miss you . Veronica , help me !.. of the Lost World Careful , Challenger , here it comes . Good morning , Marguerite ! It 's time to greet another magnificent day with ... Ha ! Fresh toast ! Unusual to see on outside its cage during hibernation season , I must say I heard that . This could be one for your science journals , George : rare species spotted on a remote plateau . Observers lives endangered by ... Coffee ! There 's no coffee ! There 's plenty in the storage shed , Marguerite ... I brought it back from the Zanga village myself . Those beans are green , Roxton ! You have n't roast them yet ! That 's not my job , Marguerite . I sew for all of us . Challenger smelts metal ingots to trade with the Zanga . Veronica tends the gardens and the goat ... you smoke the meat and roast the coffee . And cast the bullets . And load the cartridges . Poor you . The coffee is still your job ... we 've had to adjust the division of labor . Missing ? Why ca n't anybody come out and say what really happened ? Marguerite , I 'm sorry ... but you and Veronica did agree to take on more of the food preparation . Coffee 's not food ! It 's ... it 's a necessity ! And you 're its main consumer . Which is another reason I wish Malone was n't dead . Whatever . Americans drink more of this stuff than I ever did . He got me started on it in the first place ! He 's not dead ! - Good morning , Veronica . - Veronica ? Jungle daylight is no substitute for Zanga 's espresso . I saw him last night . We all have dreams about Malone , Veronica . Not the same dreams we had about Summerlee , of course . Right here ! I mean , I dream about him too . But when I woke up , he was just standing there . Challenger , he was pleading for my help . Assai ! Professor Challenger ! My people ask for you to come at once . You are not going anywhere , you have a lot to work ... to do on the new test balloon so we can go home . What 's wrong , Assai ? What 's happened ? That 's just it , Professor . We do not know . It could be a sign from the heavens or elsewhere . When she puts it like that , how can I resist . Watch me . I could see she 's most unhappy . Because of Malone ? And she 's getting worse . Past few days she 's mostly stayed in her room . She keeps re-reading Malone 's journals . It 's a pity she would n't come with us today . Would have done her good to talk to an old friend like you . Veronica is strong . Her sorrows only make her stronger . Veronica , as difficult as it may be ... to believe , I would like to apologize . You 're right . Family , friends more than friends . I do know how you feel . Is it really that hard to accept ... that I could care about something more than gold or diamonds ? Yes ! One of your more endearing and annoying traits ... is that you never lie to me . Just as I 've never lied to you . About important things I apologize ! For not saying sooner than I know ... that Malone means as much to all of us as he does to you . Well , now you 've said it . - All right , what is it ? - It 's called a Ouija board . It 's all the rage in Europe and London . What does it do ? Think of it as a telephone for a very long distance calls . I brought the outsider . Yesterday it was just a field . Last night it was touched by a force beyond this world . Someone made that in just one night ? Someone . Or something . Put your hands here by mine . Have you ever used one of these before ? Yeah , a few times , in London . And did it work ? Let 's just see if it works now . What do we do ? Put your fingers here as lightly as you can . We wish to contact Edward T . Malone . Are you out there , Ned ? Malone , we know you 've been trying to contact Veronica . Here 's your big chance . Are you here with us ? You did that . No , you were touching it too . Why do n't you ask him a question ? Malone ? Where are you ? - See , I told you . - Whoa ! H E L - P - Help M help me , help me That 's what he said to me last night ! Do you actually think it could be him ? Well , if he said it before , maybe it could be . I do n't think we have to . G O T Go , go to ! Where Where Where - the go to where ... P - A - T - H Go to where the path is ! Who 's there ? Marguerite ! If it 's like a telephone , How do you hang it up ? It looks like there 's two of them too , why ? Look out I have a pan Marguerite , what have you done ? I do n't know ! AH ! Oh , no ! Okay , okay . Does this always happen in London ? I wish ! I would have made a fort-What ? what it is ? who is that ? Right . Let 's see Challenger explain this one . It 's an agroglyph . Of course it is , George , What else would it be ? It 's a name given to a unique explicable ... patterns or markings in a field of vegetation . Variations include ... So you 've seen one of these before ? Never . Although they are quite common in the vicinity of Avery , back in England . And have been for generations . Well , that 's where my family 's estate is . It 's surrounded by fields of standing stones , dating back to the Druids . But I 've never seen or heard of one of these pyroglyphs . Farmers do n't like to talk about them . They believe they are connected to some supernatural power . The circles of stones , circles in fields supposedly marking power spots , where lines of unexplained force intersect . There is no sign of kerosene or any other fire accelerant being used . So no one knows how this type of thing gets made . Our shaman refuses to set foot in this field . He says he knows too well why it 's been visited upon us . Our shaman says that Saros is returning . This is his sign ... cursing those who rose against him ... swearing to return from the realm beyond death ... to take vengeance on the living . Realm beyond death . Tell me . In the Zanga tradition , is it possible to return from this realm ? Our shaman says the proof is all around us ... painted by the hand of Saros himself . Is that so . If this is paint from beyond the grave , I want to analyze the pigment . Good heavens ! Redecorating , are we ? I made Veronica a Ouija board . Marguerite . That is a tool for charlatans ! Maybe back in England . The board is controlled by its users . There 's not a whit of evidence to prove that it could possibly work . I 'll be in my lab if I 'm needed . Are you okay ? Assai ... So , what really happened ? The spirits were restless . As long as nobody got hurt by whatever little ... game you two were amusing yourself with . Do you really think we made this mess for our own amusement ? There 's no telling what you 're capable of , Marguerite , without your coffee . I mean , if you could have this much fun with a Ouija board , think of what you could do with a full-blown s ? ance ! What is a s ? ance ? Scales , drives tubes , pentrometre , Ph tests , I got them all . science picnic basket by any other name . Sure you do n't want us to call you a taxi ? Ah , No , no . Just try to leave the walls standing this time . Come on , Roxton ! Good bye . All right , they 're gone . Now tell me why ... we could n't tell them what we saw on the mirror ... something like that . Veronica , What did you see in the mirror ? You know , George , a few days ago you were convinced Malone 's presence was moving journals around to help us out . Then an hour ago you were laughing at ... Marguerite 's Ouija board . I mean , what do you believe ? Roxton , I 'm a scientist . I do n't let what I believe get in the way of what I observe . Maybe so . But just for a moment , forget science , forget logic . Give me your best gut instinct , a seat of the pants wildest guess . Now what do you think made that pyroglyph ? - My best guess . - Yes . The pyroglyph is a series of ... hitherto undocumented phenomena ... that a series of chemical analyses might explain . Sometimes , Challenger , you 're not fun at all . Raptors ! More than one ! Stampede ! It 's almost as if something frightened them ! Yeah . Marguerite . Did you also see this ? Yes . You can not do this ! This is a sign of Saros ! Saros ? That 's who we saw ? Who 's Saros ? A bloodthirsty warlord who was ... burned alive when the Zanga rose up against him . But we did n't try to reach Saros ! We called for Malone ! - And Malone heard us . - He did ? Well , you said it yourself there were two spirits in the room ! Unseen spirits ! Well , he was here . We saw him in the mirror . And someone drove him away before he could harm us . Malone . But this time we 're going to get Malone back without Saros . Veronica , no ! It is too dangerous ! Would Malone wish you to endanger the lives of all the Zanga ? Listen , we ca n't do anything until midnight anyway . That 's the witching hour . Well . Now we know what sends raptors into a stampede . What do you say , Challenger ? A ball of lightning or some kind of electrical whirlwind ? That 's not important . Look at the pattern it 's making ! That 's identical to the first one . Which means this is not a natural process . Whatever that ball of light is , it 's under intelligent control ! Challenger , this is the one time I do n't think we find answers in your test tubes . We found a second pyroglyph . Yeah quite incredible . We saw it being burned into a field . - You saw who made it ? - No , not a person , More like a sphere of light . I was only joking about holding a s ? ance , Marguerite ! It 's no joke , Roxton . Veronica and I , when we used the Ouija board , we both saw this dead Zanga warlord . Saros , That 's the same pattern was saw in the pyroglyphs . - Finally , a voice of reason ! I would n't put reason and s ? ance in the same category . Sometimes , with extraordinary phenomena , it requires investigation by extraordinary means . Professor Challenger , It is too dangerous . Not if Marguerite knows exactly what she 's doing . Do n't I always ? We 've gone some time before midnight , and that 's the witching hour . I 've got things to square away in my lab . You know , everything is upside-down . You were the only one who though Malone was truly dead . Challenger 's the last person to believe in s ? ances ! The truth is , I do n't know what happened to Malone , and neither does Challenger . Which means we 're the only two with open minds around here . I think it 's fair to say I have an open mind . It 's your heart that 's open , John . You do n't want to take that hope away from Veronica . Perhaps you are right . But do n't you believe that there 's ... something more to life than the here and now ? Sometimes when I think about what my life has given me , in the here and now , I wonder what more I could possibly ask for . Challenger says it 's time . Challenger , I do n't think this is the time for a group portrait . Right you are . Oh , Marguerite , light the candles ? Challenger , how does a scientist know so much about s ? ances ? I spent several months in Chicago ... with a good friend of mine , Harry Houdini . Harry know it all Houdini ? Two-bit meddling magician ? I attended a dozen s ? ances with Harry , and worked with him to debunk the fraudulent mediums ... and mystics who prey upon gullible people . I take it you 're acquainted with him as well . What you actually took money from grieving ... people who thought you could talk to the dead ? I call it giving people what they want . Let 's not forget that this s ? ance is Challenger 's idea . It 's Roxton 's actually . And it 's not a bad idea . What ? Are we all ready ? first join hands . Okay , close your eyes . Okay . Clear your minds . I call Edward T . Malone . Ned , can you hear me ? Are you there ? Did you feel that ? It 's like the temperature dropped 20 degrees . That means it 's working . I really think something is going to happen ! Malone ! If you are among us , knock once . One very exuberant knock ! This is so wrong ! Perhaps you could ask him if we are at risk here . Ned , one knock for yes , two for no . Try channel him through you , Ask him to speak through you ? OK . Speak through me , spirit . Let all of us hear what you have to say . Do not open a path for me here . Saros will try to take it . Follow what I have written . Do not try to open a path for me here ! Malone ? Upon your flesh shall I feast , and in your blood shall I bathe . - It 's Saros ! - And in your ... I shall live . your vile hearts your sons You let her go . Is over this Is it over ? We 've broken the circle , That 's supposed to be enough . Saros still has her . Marguerite ! Marguerite ! - That 's him ! - Marguerite ! NO ! I never meant for this to happen . I was trying to send you a message to tell you where I was ! How to help bring me back . I did n't know ... that by trying to open a path for me , you 'd endanger yourselves . I wo n't let you risk your lives . You mean too much to me . So you 've got to let me go . Bye , Veronica , I 'm going to miss you . I 'm going to miss you all . What happened ? Malone cold n't have done this . Saros , the butcher ! How 's Marguerite ? Shaken but not hurt . I feel like I 've been kicked by a mule ! - A supernatural one at that . - Yeah , Thank goodness . Everyone 's all right ? You took a picture of what happened ? A photograph of something . Challenger , you are nothing short of brilliant . So they say . What have we got here ? Look at this ! Absolutely uncanny . They 're both there , Malone and Saros ! Do n't you understand what happened ? Yes I do . Assai ! I ca n't promise that ! None of us can . If I can not stop you , then there 's nothing that can stop Saros . I have to warn my people . Looking for something in particular ? I ca n't stop thinking about what Malone said when he spoke through you . Do not open a path here , but follow what I 've written . But written where ? It 's going to take weeks to read them all . I have read them all , Marguerite . If Malone 'd had written anything about Saros or s ? ances , I 'd know about it . Challenger wants to hold a second s ? ance tonight . Maybe it 'll be easier for Malone to talk to us the second time around . Marguerite ! Veronica , did you really need to draw that . - I did n't ! Written ! So Saros did n't create the pyroglyphs ! Malone did . If the pyroglyphs are Malone 's writings , he 's obviously trying to tell us something . But what ? OH ! Malone , that had better be you . Marguerite , do n't interrupt the phenomenon . It 's a triangle ! Three knives pointing , triangulation . Co-ordinates for a specific location ! Somewhere there is a third pyroglyph . It 'll take days to search all the fields between here and the Zanga village . Not necessarily . George , you make me nervous when you get that look in your eye . Another 50 feet , and I 'll be able to see over into the next valley ! Careful Marguerite , keep the ropes nice and taut . So we follow the Summerlee River , to the Zanga village . There 's the first one . Thinking positively , it looks like ... Challenger 's new rubber ... formula might have solved the embrittlement problem . Who knows , it might even get us passed those updrafts at the plateau 's edge . Passed the updrafts and home . Why , Marguerite , I ... thought a chance out of this place would cheer you up . Me , yes . I do n't know how Veronica 's going to take it . What ? What ? Oh , nothing , just for a moment ... there it actually sounded like you were worried about Veronica . No ! Just worried about our division of labour if she ... decides to spend the next month moping in her bedroom , that 's all . My thoughts exactly . We came along the Malone Rift ... there 's the second one ! Maybe around to the south there 's the Krux Mountain . Ah the falls and ... here it is ! Challenger , look out ! Do n't shoot the balloon ! Challenger ! Come on ! Come on ! Help ! Down ! Now we found the third pyroglyph here , and that 's describing a triangle with this point as its center . Then that must be where Malone wants us to go . It 's a rocky outcrop in dense jungle . So you 're going to have to move quickly in order to cut a trail for us before midnight . I 'll have to cut the trail ? You and Marguerite . I have to go back to the tree house and get Veronica , and a few items we might need . What do you know that we do n't know all of a sudden ? Now that we know where Malone wants us to go , I realize we are not just dealing with opening a line of communication to the other realm . We have to create a physical connection . - Will that be safe ? - No , not at all . I suspect we 've already opened a path for Saros ... to gain a foothold in our world . - So then we have to close the path . - As quickly as possible . Then how will Malone get back ? To be honest I 'm not sure he can . Okay , I 've got it , We 've found the third pyroglyph , so now we know exactly where Malone wants us to go . I knew Malone was trying to tell us something . But what does the photo plate have to do with it ? It 's for the s ? ance Marguerite is going to conduct . It carries a physical imprint of Saros , which gives him a psychometric link to our world . But ... by destroying the plate at the proper time , in the proper place , that link can be broken . Malone 's image is on that ! Wo n't his link be broken too ? Not if you choose something from your personal belongings that has great meaning to both you and Malone . You are going to be his link to our world . You are his only chance . - If you insist . I do . Malone 's handkerchief . Good . He left it on the riverbank the day we first ... Umm ... we went swimming and ... he was being so funny ! We were splashing around like ... I just know it 's a day that I 'll always remember . We all know that you and Malone were , are very close . Maybe we could be something more , I do n't really know . But I 'd like the chance to find out . What 's so special about this cave ? How are we going to know when we reach the right spot ? I think this is the right spot . Yeah . These are standing stones , dating back to the Druids . They are much older than that ! How do you know that ? I just do . It 's ... like I 've seen this place before or somewhere like it . Playing on the fairy rings and standing stones . Why would Malone lead us so deep into the jungle ? I suspect he is direction us to an extremely strong ... intersection of earth energy lines . Perhaps the most powerful on the entire plateau . Just what we need . More power for Saros . And a more power for a path for Malone . Are you ready ? Ask Marguerite . She looks like she know what she 's doing . Marguerite , you 've already created a link with Malone . So call him again , just as you did in the tree house . Wo n't that bring Saros ? If Challenger 's right , Saros is almost halfway here . I call Edward T . Malone ! Oh , you 're making this look easy , Malone . What 's going on , Challenger ? The path between our world and ... the other realm is now completely opened . Over there , through the light . Is that Malone ? Saros . - Now Challenger , Destroy it ! That risks severing the link to Malone is back with us . Do what you 've got to , but do it fast ! - Call Malone . - Pay attention , Malone ! Over there ! Come back to us , Malone ! Come back ! Concentrate ! Be concentrate ! Malone , get back here ! This instant ! Focus on Malone . Ned ! I 'm going to try to weaken the link with Saros . Hello ? No ! Challenger , now ! I 'm back ! Ned ? Malone ! Malone ! Glad to see you back , Neddie boy ! It 's a real mystery . I do n't know how I did this . So much of what I experienced seems like a dream or a nightmare . I just ca n't remember the details . The important thing is that you are back here with us . Where you belong . Looking better than ever , I must say . Oh not us . I knew you would n't leave me ... us ! All of us . I bet you 're starved ! You know what I would love ? - What ? - What ? Is there any coffee ? Of course there is ! Around here it 's a necessity . Thank you . - Challenger ? - Not with the claret . Thank you . *

I mean , I 've talked to you ... I 've listened to you , I 've shared ideas with you . What 's that about ? - I had the exact same problem with ... - What ? I do n't know what it takes with women . I mean , you put in all this time and effort , and they wan na be ... just friends . I know . I hate that . Man , and to think I was going to kick your ass . You had every reason . You hear that , Donna ? " Every reason . " You know what , Eric ? You do n't trust me and you do n't respect me . No , Donna , I was just trying to ... Get away from me ! It would n't have worked out with her and me anyway . I mean , I 'm not supposed to say anything ... but we 're just here until my dad closes down the plant . Wait . My dad 's depending on that job . Yeah , I guess he should have thought ahead like my dad . You bastard ! You broke my nose ! Good ! You 'll pay for this , Forman ! Before I leave , Donna will be mine ! Dad . - Hey , Dad , can I talk to you ? - Absolutely . Eric , I am very disappointed in you for fighting . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . See you in the car . Where are you guys going ? Taking your mother out for dinner and a movie . A little celebration . You know , son , sometimes life gives you a good bounce . So , what 'd you want to talk about ? Have a good time . Yeah . Hey , little brother , I made out with Kelso . Shut up ! - What is wrong with you ? - Everything 's wrong . Donna 's mad at me ... Guess this is a bad time to tell him I flunked out of college . You know what , Laurie ? I can not believe that you 're the favorite . Yeah , does n't it kick ass ? That Vader 's got him . There 's no way out of this . Is this a true story ? Yeah . That voice . James Earl Jones ! Eric actually liked this ? That kid 's on dope . Whoa . 
@@5224441 We 've time for one more , Roz . We have Sid on three . Hello , Sid . I 'm listening .  ' Hello , Dr Crane . I fear talking on the phone to people I do not know . ' I freeze up . ' lt is a severe handicap in today 's fast-paced world . ' Are you reading what you 're saying ?  ' Yes , I am . ' The only way I can communicate is to write out everything in advance . ' What if someone asks you something you have n't anticipated ? ' Thank you for your insightful comments . Goodbye . ' Wait ! Sid ! Sid , your insecurity lies in your fear of making a mistake . You have to practise . lf you work at it , you too may achieve ... the command and confidence to which we all aspire to ... be having . This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health . - That was a show good . - Thank you , Roz . - Knock , knock . But you may . What are you up to ? You had that same look when you found Flagstad 's 1 932 " G ? tterd ? mmerung " . If all goes well , my lapel will be sagging under the weight of a membership pin . You 'll fit in with those blue bloods who would n't even spit on the rest of us . Do n't jinx it . I 'm not in yet . There 's still a party where they screen prospective members . - How did this come about ? - I thank Maris . She spent years cultivating relationships until fortune smiled on us . Old Judge Clements suffered a stroke and a vacancy opened up . Gives new meaning to " a stroke of luck " . It gets better . There are actually two vacancies . Edgar van Cortland was indicted in a scandal . Frasier , I think my time has come . - I 'm very happy for you . - You 're not ? - No . - They have a planetarium . - So ? I think my work here is done . - So he 's getting into the Empire Club ? - lt appears so . He deserves to have lunch in that private dining room , read in that fabled mahogany library . - lt 's eating you ? - Like a bacteria . If he gets in , I should too . What if I know someone who could get you invited ? - Do n't toy with me . - Mr Strickland , please . lt 's Roz . - Walter Strickland Junior ? - Senior . - How do you know him ? - The less you know , the better . I need more comfortable shoes . My dogs are killing me . - Pardon ? - My " dogs " . My feet . - What do you call them in England ? - By their rightful names . Except Uncle Harold . He named his anatomy after the royal family . A jolly fellow ... until Aunt Kate caught him introducing the Prince of Wales to a waitress . - Are you almost finished ? - Yes , I am . You 'll have the handsomest midriff . - I hope my date concurs . - Who are you taking ? Dr Susan Anderson . She 's as boring as toast but a brilliant physician and socially well-connected . Is n't Niles a little ticked off ? Yes , but I convinced him if we work together we 'll secure both vacancies . It 's like when you were kids . lf one has something , the other has to , too .  I had to buy two Balinese lutes , two d ? coupage kits , two pairs of lederhosen . When you moved out , that was one embarrassing garage sale . - Hello , Niles . - Ready ? - No . Susan 's at the hospital . - Where 's Maris ? In the Mercedes practising her vivacious giggle . Let 's go over our strategy . " I also researched our competition . Do n't worry . One of them flies coach . We 're as good as in . Unless ... I just had a terrifying thought . What if another candidate researched the skeletons in our closet ? Damn it ! - That 's as bad as it gets . - I would n't be so sure . They would n't look kindly on your arrest for mooning President Nixon . I was young and firm and in love with an anarchist . That 's minor compared to your suicide attempt . It was not a legitimate attempt . I did it to get Lilith 's attention .  Maris and I should head over . The others will get a leg up on us . - Good idea . See you there . - Bye , Dad . Hello . Oh , Susan , I 've been expecting you . Are you in the car ? No ! You 're still at the hospital ? Of course I understand . Fat chance . - Stood you up ? - This is disastrous . - Just go stag . - I 'd look like I could n't find a date . Why are we worried ? We got a Cinderella right under this roof . That 's the last time I get grout up without wearing rubber gloves . I 've so much gunk under my nails , I look like I 've been worming a pig . Trust me , the English accent will sell it . Oh , yes . lt 's everything I ever imagined it would be and more . What 's that smell , Dr Crane ? That 's power . Call me Frasier . People must n't know you work for me . We 've dated for six months . All right , Frasier . Anything else , Frasier ? Are we in love or is this just a physical thing , Frasier ? Stop that . Oh , Niles . How goes the chase ? Brilliantly . Daphne . - Evening . Back in a minute , darling . - Darling ? - My date cancelled . Daphne 's filling in . You think I 'd go out with Daphne ? You are a man . She is a goddess , whose bedroom is only 41 steps from your own . Where 's Maris ? Apologising to another candidate 's wife . Maris bumped a dish of crabmeat into the woman 's d ? colletage . - Accidents will happen . - As long as the hors d'oeuvres flow . My God . Feel this leather . I have had pudding stiffer than this . Frasier , Kenneth Spencer . I 'm sure it was satisfying being Phi Beta Kappa at Yale , but surely you would have been happier at Princeton ? Anyone who 's anyone went there . Excuse me , I 'm Kenneth Spencer . As it happens , I went to Princeton . No ! What are the odds ? I 'm Dr Frasier Crane . My brother , Dr Niles Crane , the eminent psychiatrist . Try this caviar , Frasier . I met the most charming gentleman , Edgar van Cortland . I thought he lost his membership in a scandal . He was acquitted and reinstated into the club . - Oh , he was innocent . - No . Just acquitted . So there 's only one membership ? Yes . But if one is selected you can bring the other as a guest . If only one can become a member , I hope it 's you . - That 's noble . - I know what it means to him . We ca n't risk another suicide attempt . That 's amusing , using humour to defuse a tense situation . I 'm sure that helped when you were in prison . - Kenneth . - Excuse me .  Stop it ! Do you intend to run each other down and ruin both your chances ? - You 're right . - Thank you . Cocktails ? Yes . Your best 1 8-year-old Lowland single-malt Scotch . - A discriminating choice . Mum says , " Why ca n't I meet your boyfriends ? " I say , " The plane trip takes four hours - longer than my relationships last . " There 's Niles . Do n't look at him . Pretend we do n't see him . Real mature . Thanks to him I ca n't say the phrase I 've rehearsed for a lifetime : " lf you need me , I 'll be at my club . " This is so boring . You owe each other an apology . Yes , but I apologised first last time . That means it 's his turn . Goody ! I can be mature about this . - Niles . - Frasier . After last night , an apology is in order . I agree . Well ? - Well what ? - I apologised first last time . - No , you didn't . - I did . After the Monet exhibit . My secretary left a heartfelt apology with your service . So you did . lt is my turn again . Damn ! - We just turned on each other ! - lt was embarrassing . My only excuse is that all my life I dreamed of belonging to a club . As a child , when I formed clubs with my bears , some did n't make it . Hello . Yes , this is Dr Crane . It 's the club . Yes ? I see . Thank you for considering me . If you 'd care to speak to my brother , he 's here . Be gracious . Yes , I see . Thank you very much for calling . Goodbye . Do n't let it get you down . We were fine without them before . We 're fine without them , are n't we ? Oh , my God . You got in . Congratulations . I 'd better go break the news to Maris . Niles , your getting passed over drains every drop of joy from this . Thank you . You 're a good brother . Yes ! I got in ! Shout it from the rooftops ! Of course ... what really matters is family . Beg . Come on . We 've worked on this . You can do it . Beg . Sit . Good boy ! - What are you doing ? - Teaching him a trick . - With my imported prosciutto ? - lt 's worth it . - Not unless he can sing from " Tosca " . - Where are you going ? The Empire Club . I 've come to a moral decision . I will insist they give Niles my membership . That 's a hell of a gesture . I put myself in Niles ' place . He 's spent 1 5 years trying to climb Seattle 's social ladder . Then within two years , I 'm known throughout the city and I grab the prize he 's wanted most of all . It just is n't fair . - You 're a good kid . - Thank you , Dad . I 'll say this while I still can ... lf anyone needs me I 'll be at my club . Now you 're done with me , I 'm just cast aside . Unappreciated , unloved and forgotten . I see the prosciutto is n't the only imported ham in the house . Give me your shirt . I need a full load . - Anything white ? - Yeah , but you 're not getting them .  - Hello , Dr Crane . - Hello , Daphne . Dad . Niles . Just passed Frasier . Where was he off to ? He went to the club . No wonder he was evasive . I hope you do n't mind my stopping by . I had no place else to go . Niles , you may get into that club yet . - What ? - He went to give his spot to you . is this a sick joke ? You should be happy . He 's giving up his own membership . What would I be happy about ? This is humiliating . My brother going to make them take me ? His heart 's in the right place . I do n't care if they invite me now , even if they BEG ! Good boy ! Excuse me , is the Club President here ? Yes , Mr Drake is over there . Thank you . Mr Drake ? - Dr Frasier Crane . - Yes , of course . The new blood . Please sit down . Sir , I 've come here on a matter of personal business . It 's about my brother Niles . Niles is sort of ... My God . This leather 's as soft as a baby 's bottom . On family night we bring babies in and do a blindfold comparison test . That 's a joke , Crane . Yes , indeed . Darn good one too , sir . My brother may seem priggish but he 's the most discriminating man I know . You 'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger snob in this room . - Are you serious ? - Yes , I am . After all , blood is thicker than port . - I stand corrected . - Let me be candid with you , Crane . We were quite firm about accepting anybody in the entertainment business . Radio psychiatrist falls into that category . Radio psychiatrist ? But Niles ... - There 's been a mistake . - No , there has n't . Dad said you 'd try to get me in your club . Do n't bother . I do n't need you to fight my battles . - But ... - Butt out . You 've made it clear how you feel , so I 'd like to share how I feel . I 'd sooner spend time in a bus station than spend one moment with you smug bigwigs with your oriental carpets and overstuffed chairs ... My God , it 's like a baby 's bottom ! You ca n't reject me because I reject you . Friend of the average Joe . Niles , they got our names mixed up . I did n't get in . You did . What ? It was you they wanted . I 'm in ? Good God , do n't just stand there . Fetch me some port . Escort these gentlemen out . You ca n't think I meant the things I said . Excuse me , sir , I must ask you to leave . You and who else ? Niles , we do n't need this club . Let us leave with dignity . No . There 's been a misunderstanding . I could just come part time . Perhaps just one afternoon . Thursday 's a slow day . I would n't talk to anyone . I could just sit in a chair . Please ! Let me stay . I belong here ! # Hey baby , I hear the blues are calling tossed salads and scrambled eggs # Mercy ! # And maybe I seem a bit confused Well , maybe ...

Who 's Peri ? - An old girlfriend , all right ? - I was just asking . Last time I saw her , she was mainlining cocaine . Oh , yeah , exactly . D D Advertising , may I help you ? We 're not going to make a decision . Not until we consider everyone who 's there . This is important to us too . Fine , call me in an hour . Goodbye . What the hell are you doing here ? - I 'm back . - So I see . For how long ? More or less ... permanently . You left two weeks ago , Alison . What happened ? I ... I realized I 'd acted hastily and that I made a mistake . And I guess I 'm here now to beg for my old job back before I go looking for something else . Oh , Alison . I gave you plenty of time to think about this . In fact , I begged you to reconsider . I know , I know , and you were right . It was just one of those things . Not at all . I 'd hoped to have a chance to prove myself again . I 've worked hard for this company , Lucy . I 'm ready to work even harder . I 'm the first to admit that I made a mistake . Sorry . It 's not going to be that easy . - Is the position still open ? - It is . - Can I at least interview ? - Yes , but not with me . I 've turned hiring over to someone else . Whatever it takes , and whoever I have to impress , I 'll do it . Amanda . Alison . What are you doing here ? - I 'm back . - So I see . You come for a little visit ? No , actually , I 'm here to get my old job back . - You 've got to be kidding . - No , I 'm serious . Lucy told me you 're interviewing for the position . Yes . Alison , sit down . - What happened to Keith ? - Things did n't work out . Personally , I never thought it would . - So are you back together with Billy ? - Back to sharing an apartment . Funny , I always thought it was more than that , but I realize you 're both so scared of a real relationship , the only thing either one of you can commit to sharing - with another person is the rent . - Amanda , that 's not fair . In my book , the only thing fair in this situation is that you 're out of a job . Come on , Amanda . Ca n't we just put all this behind us ? I mean , we used to be friends , remember ? You 're right . I 'm still committed to interviewing a number of people this week . But , in the meantime , let me try and convince Lucy to put you back on the phones . Back on the phones . Thank you , Amanda . - Yeah , well , it was . The owner came to pick it up today . Kissed me like I 'd pulled his kid out of a coma . Promised to send the guys in his bike club to me . Well , Dr Jake . Why do n't you take me someplace fabulous for dinner to celebrate ? Actually , there 's a wonderful little taco stand that just opened up a couple blocks from here .

Yeah , well , I think you better . Jake 's Bikes . Do n't tell me you own your own business . - As a matter of fact , I do . Jake always was on the lookout for a rich business partner . Look , whatever you 've got to tell me , why do n't you come right out and say it . No , this is a private matter . Strictly private . What you decide to do with that information is up to you , but for now , we talk alone . I 'll see you back at the building . - It was nice to meet you . - Likewise . So , what 's on your mind ? Let 's get out of here . Oh , great , my stuff came . Well , you 've been at work all day . That 's a good sign . Who says I 've been at work ? What happened ? I 've been demoted . Back to the phones until Amanda can figure out who she wants to hire for my position . - What 's wrong with you ? - Well , I 'm a contender . I 'm sorry . Oh , that 's life . I think I 'll be able to repair the relationship . I just ca n't believe I have to brown-nose Amanda - to get my old job back . - You got ta do whatever it takes . Do n't let any misguided sense of ethics get in the way . I 've been doing that . It 's been holding me back . - What are you talking about ? - Well , I 've decided to apply my creative writing skills to my resume . " Master 's in journalism , Columbia University . Six months , junior copywriter , D D Advertising . " You got ta give the people what they want . And besides , I got a tip that there 's a job opening at a really cool magazine . - I 'm gon na do whatever it takes . - You put me as a reference ! But look at the title I gave you . Senior ad exec in charge of West Coast accounts . I was pretty screwed up there for a while , Jake . Heroin . Did you know I was shooting heroin before we hooked up again ? No . Yeah , well , it was pretty fashionable for a while , but everybody who does that ends up in a rehab sooner or later . That 's where I 've been the past few months . So you 're clean ? Clean ... Not exactly . It was weird . I got the drugs out of my system , and that felt great . I vowed to start a whole new life , you know . Macrobiotics and exercise . The whole bit . But ... But then I got sick . I got the flu , and that turned into pneumonia . And I called the doctor , and he put me into the hospital and ... He said that ... He told me that I have AIDS . - Oh , my God . - It 's probably from sharing needles . Well , if I recall correctly , we did have our fun . - Have you ever been tested ? - No . I never had any reason to . Well , you do now . - Hi . - Hi . - When 'd you get back ? - Just a little while ago . Come on in . Do n't tell me there 's another kid you do n't know about , Jake . No , no , it 's nothing like that . Peri just ... She 's been having some hard times , and she needed some money . Then I guess she does n't know you too well , does she ? You may not believe this , but seeing you with her brought out the jealous possessive nature in me . Oh , come on , Jo . Jealous of her ? Please . - Why not ? She 's gorgeous . - So are you . You know , if you do n't mind , I 'd kinda just like to go to bed . Jake , is everything all right ? Fine , really , it 's fine . I 'll see you in the morning , all right ? Yeah . Sleep well . - Good morning , Amanda . - ' Morning , Alison . - Can I talk to you ? - I have a lot of calls to make . - It 'll just take a minute . - Shoot . I just want you to know how fond I 've always been of you . From the first day we started working together , I 've always admired and looked up to you as both a friend and a mentor . And I hope things work out because I look forward to learning from you . I know that together we can continue to make a really great team . How sweet . And I want you to know that no matter who I ultimately decide to hire for this position , I hope I can continue to be an inspiration to you . Thank you . My 9. Right .

Leave them here . - I 'll make sure she gets them . - Sorry , this is a singing delivery . - I have to deliver them in person . - OK . Down the hall , third door on your right . Deadline 's Thursday . If he 's not going to deliver the piece , let me know so I can be sure to never use him again . And I have to go because somebody just delivered me flowers . I do n't know . OK , keep me posted . These are beautiful . Is n't there a card ? - No , actually , they 're from me . You think this is the best way to get a job here ? I 'm tired of being reduced to a faceless resume on some editor 's desk . I 'd do anything for the opportunity to meet you in person so I could let you know what a asset I 'd be for your magazine if you 'd just give me the chance . I see , well , sit down . Mr Campbell . Well , an MBA from Columbia Journalism does n't hurt . And a year as a copywriter at D D Advertising . - Right . - I 'll tell you what I 'm willing to do . I 'm gon na read your column . If I like what I see , I might check references . If all that goes well , we might have something to talk about . I hope so . And ... journalistic ethics prohibit me . - Give ' em to your girlfriend . - I appreciate you considering me . You bet . Which part are you having trouble believing ? We have n't fooled around in over a year . Why should I have anything to worry about ? Jake , I do n't know how long I 've been HIV-positive . My God , if either of us had the brains to get tested ... Do n't put the blame on me . I did n't do anything wrong . Tell me you never had unprotected sex with another woman before we met . For all I know , you could have given it to me . Oh , yeah . It does n't matter anymore . The fact is , I have it , and I 'm doing something about it . Look , I 've carried out my part of the bargain . I 've warned you . You 're at risk . Now it 's up to you to get tested . And to be safe , I 'd bring your girlfriend with you . And for her sake , you better not either . If you 'll excuse me , I do n't think there 's anything further we have to say to each other . Peri . - Thank you , thank you , thank you . - For what ? I got the job at Escapade Magazine . Yeah . - I start tomorrow . - Oh , that 's great . Yeah . Well , she really liked my work , and she liked my spirit . She said you raved about me . What did you tell her ? I lied through my teeth and said you were brilliant . - I deserve a commission . - You 've got ta help me celebrate . - Oh , no , I can't . - Oh , why not ? I 'm happy for you , but I 'm in no mood to celebrate . Not after eight humiliating hours of fetching coffee for every bozo - who interviews for my job . - Everything is gon na work out . It was n't my idea to quit your job and move to Seattle . - You made those mistakes on your own . - Thank you . Now I feel wonderful . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You 're gon na come out and celebrate with me , whether it kills you . OK , OK . Come on , it ca n't be that bad . - Hi , Matt , how 's it goin ' ? - Good . Can I join you , or did you come here to get away from it all ? - No , no . I 'm just waiting for Jo . - Beer , please . I 'm gon na ask you something . If you think it 's too personal , - I want you to forget I mentioned it . - Shoot . Have you ever had an AIDS test ? - Yes . Definitely , yes . Nothing 's ever scared me . I mean , really scared me , until I started thinking about this . Jake , what 's going on ? I 'm just curious , I guess . Thank you . You know I had a lover who became sick and died of this disease . I was so terrified and so much in denial that I never once called him when he was sick , and I did n't go to his funeral after he passed away . But you ca n't let fear run your life . So finally , I went down and took the test . - Ready to live with any result . - And are you OK ? What I realized was that either way I 'd be OK . Look , testing positive is n't a death sentence . Ignorance is . - Hi , guys . - Hey . Hi . Something like that . - Are you gon na join us ? I do n't think so . - Come on . Thanks for the talk . - Anytime . OK , Jake , what 's going on ? Jo ... - Jo , we have to talk . - Then talk . I ca n't deal with this anymore . This obviously has something to do with you and Peri . I wish you 'd stop acting weird and just tell me ! - She has AIDS . - What ? She was just diagnosed , and now she 's telling everyone who ... Wait , what does this mean ? Jake , did you and Peri have sex without using anything ? Yeah , we probably did . - Oh , Jake . - Truth is , I never thought about AIDS . I knew it was out there . I never thought it 'd be part of my life . Neither did I . It 's one of the benefits of being married . We stumbled back and went for it . Yeah , and I thought about asking you to use a condom , but I figured , what the hell , I 'm on the pill . I did n't wan na spoil the mood . And I had one . But I thought , " What the hell . She 's been married . And there 's no possible way that I could give anything to her . " I was wrong . I may have given you AIDS . If I did I 'll never be able to forgive myself . Jake we 'll get through this together . OK . - Come in . - You wanted to see me ? Oh , Amanda , yes . Come on in . I know I told you that you could hire whoever you wanted to replace Alison . Amanda , this is not a sorority . It is an ad agency . I suggest you solve your personal problems . Learn to function as a team . - Would you send Alison Parker in here ? - Are you saying I have to hire her ? Amanda , Alison is smart , she works hard , she knows this company . Professionally , I ca n't think of a single reason not to bring her back . Come in . - Hi , you wanted to see me ? - Yes . Hi , Amanda . Amanda told me she 's come to a decision about who she wants to hire . Welcome back , Alison . It looks like we 're a team again . Oh , that 's wonderful . I ca n't thank you enough . No need . But please , let 's get one thing clear . In the past , we let friendship get in the way of our professional relationship . Let 's not make that same mistake twice . Absolutely not . Let 's get to work . Before you take the test , it 's important for you to be informed about the test itself . A small amount of blood 'll be taken from your arm . That blood 'll be tested to see if it has come into contact with the human Immunodeficiency virus , or HIV . The virus which causes AIDS . This test 'll tell you if you have HIV in your body . If you 've become infected , this test will find HIV antibodies in your blood . Does testing positive mean I have AIDS ? No , it means that you have been infected with the HIV virus - and that you may develop AIDS . - What 's the point of knowing ? - Maybe it 's better not to . - That 's up to you , of course . Even if you have the virus , there are drugs you can take to prolong life and keep you healthy . You 're sure there 's no way anyone can find out these results ? No . A coded number only you know is used to identify it . If you have any questions , any concerns , please do n't hesitate to call . If you 'll wait here , someone will be here to take your test shortly . Twenty-four hours . I do n't know how I 'm going to make it . Some places make you wait a week . I could throw out my number and forget the whole thing . Well , that 's up to you . I 'll put it out of my mind until tomorrow . That 's a good idea . I 'm going to go back to the shop . Working on bikes never sounded so good . Let 's make a deal . We do n't talk about it , do n't think about it until we get our results . Good idea . I liked your features . Unfortunately , you wo n't be starting here as a writer . I see . Journalism 101 , it 's where everyone starts . I did n't tell you , but the girl buzzed me before you came in with the flowers . - She thought you were a male stripper . - No . Really ? Something you said about making a personal delivery . Two points for creativity . I do n't blame you . You need every edge you can get . Cameron , meet Billy . He 's gon na be your associate . - Nice to meet you . - Pleasure . I 'll leave Billy in your capable hands . Start him on the Mitchellson column . Get out your translator , the man 's dyslexic in 12 languages . That 's how you learn . By the way , who ended up with my flowers ? Oh , nobody . I ... I just threw ' em out . Good thinking , if I ca n't have them , nobody should . - Do n't beat ' em up too hard . - Kid gloves . Where 'd you go to school , anyway ? - Columbia , School of Journalism . - No kidding ? When 'd you graduate ? - ' Ninety . - I graduated Columbia in ' 88 . - Really ? What a coincidence . - Yeah , it 's funny we never met . - Well , yeah . Well , it 's a big school . - No , actually , it is n't . Anyway , you better get started . You wan na make a good impression your first day . Alison , this analysis you wrote is both lazy and sloppy . I would n't dream of showing it to Lucy . Amanda ... I 'm sorry . I actually think I helped clarify what the client is looking for . - Well , I find it thin . - Really ? Well , if you do n't mind , I think I 'd like to have Lucy look at it . - I think it 's fine . - It 's fine when I say it 's fine . Hey . So how are you doing with your end of the bargain ? Oh , I 'm blowing it big time . I just ca n't stop thinking . What if I got this ? What if my life is over ? I know how you feel . Let 's get out of here . Jake , there 's nowhere we can run to feel better . I know a place , come on . Mike , close up . Taking refuge in the desert . If it were n't for these marshmallows , I 'd say there was something vaguely biblical about this experience . It 's true . There 's something spiritual about this place . The stillness . The vastness . - I feel alive out here . - It 's beautiful . I always meant to bring you here , but I was always too busy . Wondering , too busy doing what ? Life has a funny way of rearranging priorities . How hard we all try to make it seem so complicated . I could tell you the times I 've risked my life pulling one stunt or another . Now I sit here and think , " What a privilege . Just to be young and healthy . " I 've taken it all for granted . You know , the truth is , somewhere in the back of my mind ... I never thought I 'd live past 30 . That 's how old my mother was when she committed suicide . I felt touched by that fate . That somehow , inevitably , my life would be drawn to the same end . She was sick . Manic depressive . She was in so much pain . She just had to escape living . But I am not my mother , Jake . I 'm never going to kill myself . If I do have this disease , I 'm gon na fight it with everything I 've got . - Jo , maybe everything will be fine . - Maybe . Because I do have this clarity about my life that I 've never had before . Me too . There 's one thing I 've been clear on for a long time , but I 've been too afraid to tell you . What 's that ? I love you , Jo . Thank you . I love you too . I have the results of your test . Please confirm the number in your hand is the number on this piece of paper . It is . I 'm sorry . You have tested positive . What ? Are you sure ? There must be some kind of mistake . What does this mean ? It means you have been infected with the HIV virus . You may develop AIDS . Are you all right ? Nightmare . - It 's all right . - Maybe . Come on , come on . There 's a great diner on the way back . Makes the best chilaquiles you 've ever had in your entire life . - Well , excuse me , Mr Hanson . - It 's OK . I 'm going to introduce you to chilaquiles , and then you 're going to introduce me to something wonderful I 've never experienced before . - What are we waiting for ? - C'm on , let 's go . - You , put your shoes on . Come on . - Hey , Jake . Jake ! Amanda . - Hi , can we talk ? - What 's on your mind ? Look , I 'm grateful for the job , but there 's only so much I can stand . I refuse to be your whipping post . If you 're upset about something , maybe there 's some unresolved jealousy over the situation with Billy , let 's have it out right now . What 're you talking about ? Jealous of whom ? - You know . - Just because Billy and I are n't living together does n't mean we do n't see each other . You were there too late . Billy has n't mentioned you since I 've been back from Seattle . - I 'm not surprised . - Oh , really . And why is that ? Think about it , Alison . Excuse me , I 've got to get back to work . I have the results of your test . Would you please confirm the number in your hand is the number on this piece of paper . It is . Your test results are negative . But please keep in mind , a negative result does not mean that you are immune to the virus . You must continue to practice safer sex by using a condom to protect yourself against becoming infected . - But I 'm fine ? - You appear to be . But since it does take up to six months for the HIV infection to test positive in a blood test , we recommend you repeat the test in six months and any time after that you feel you may have come into contact with the AIDS virus . Are you OK ? I 'm sorry I had to put you through this . No , I 'm glad we got tested . We should 've been doing this in the beginning . You just gave us a little push , that 's all . - I 'll say . Boy , do I feel lucky . - Let 's go out and celebrate . There 's someplace I 've got to go first . - You wanted to see me ? - Yes , Billy , come on in . - How 's everything going so far ? - Great . I put the restaurant review on your desk last night . Yes , I thought you did a nice job . The piece could 've been crisper , but that 's not your fault . Just give me a shot . I can do better . Slow down . You 're right where we need you for the moment . Now this next piece might be a bit more difficult to prove . It 's a historic perspective on L.A . 's Hispanic roots . - I 'll get right on it . Oh , and Billy , one more thing . I want your advice on this . I was working out at my gym last night . I do five nights a week without fail . There was this guy next to me who looked exactly like you . As a matter of fact I thought it was you , but it was n't . I wanted to say hello to him so badly . I was afraid he might not want to go out with me after watching me sweat for half an hour on the StairMaster . So I did n't say anything . I mean , how would you react ? As a man , I mean , if you saw a woman like me next to you on the StairMaster ? I do n't know , I guess ... Would you be attracted ? Well , sure . I should 've said something . I was too shy . Well , next time I will . Thank you , Billy . Whatever it is you have to say , make it quick . I do n't have much time . I ... I took the test . I 'm negative . So is Jo . Congratulations . - What , did you come to gloat ? - No ... I want to help you , Peri . Please , Jake . I may be sick , but I do n't need your pity . I appreciate you warning me . I 'm glad I took the test . It 's something I should 've done . I 'm sorry for the way I reacted . I did n't mean to dump on you . I do n't blame you , Jake . You had somebody to take it out on . I wish I had that luxury . But you ca n't get angry at a disease . So ... how you feeling ? I 'm OK . I have my good days and my bad days . But ... Is there anything I can do for you ? Well , you could loan me ten thou for medical bills . Other than that ... I 'm handling it . So thanks for stopping by , Jake . And ... I 'm glad you 're OK . You know , Peri ... For a moment I had to consider the fact that I had this thing . In that moment , I came to the realization that the bitterness I had towards life was a lot of wasted energy . So , look we may have made a lousy couple but we never gave friendship a try . What do you say ? Yeah . Let 's give it a try .

@@5225041 Personal log , Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge , star date 44885.5 . I 'm en route to Risa for an artificial-intelligence seminar . The Captain has ordered me to arrive early , to have fun . I shall follow his orders to the best of my ability . How about some different music , Computer ? With a Latin beat . No , something with a gentle Latin beat . Maybe Spanish guitar . Perfect . What 's the weather like on Risa ? Risa is climate-controlled for optimum tourist comfort . Is that right ? How long till we get there ? Arrival at Risa is scheduled for 0932 hours . Three hours . - How about a game ? - Please restate request . Something to pass the time , a diversion . Select either visual interactive or verbal interactive . - Verbal . - 20 seconds for each question . Level of difficulty increases as you progress . Proceed when ready . Begin . List the resonances of the sub-quantum states associated with transitional relativity . - That 's easy ! - In alphabetical order . Asymmetrical ... Inverted ... Phased ... Stable ... I knew that . OK . Give me another one . List warp modulation field patterns in order of decreasing energy . There 's the aft nacelle associative , the full ... Computer ! Sequence 010 . Maximum power to the shields , kill the music . Enterprise , I 've encountered a Romulan warbird . Coordinates at three ... - Warning ! Shield failure . - Damn ! Risa control ! Anybody ! Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission , to explore strange new worlds , ... .. to seek out new life and new civilizations , ... .. to boldly go where no one has gone before . Captain 's log , star date 4489 1.6 . The Enterprise has been ordered to accompany an emissary from the Klingon High Council to the Kriosian system , where one of their colonies is fighting for independence . There was a time when the Empire would crush a rebellion . Now it is tolerated . We have enough troubles . Conquer them again later , if we wish . May I ask , what has this to do with us ? The Governor has charged that the Federation is aiding the rebels . Does he have evidence ? Council has sent me to examine that evidence . It was my decision to invite you to accompany me . Many on the Council have great respect for you . K'adlo . I have been happy to offer occasional assistance to the Klingons . Your modesty is very human , Captain . I will excuse it . I can assure you , Ambassador , the Federation would never interfere in the affairs of the Empire . Let us hope not . It would strike at the basis of our alliance . Captain , we are in the war zone . Indeed . Ambassador , I will ask Lt Worf to make a report ... Captain , Worf 's discommendation makes that very awkward . If I could work with another officer ... Lt Worf is Chief of Security and my tactical officer . Take it easy ! Welcome , Mr . La Forge . We 've waited a long time to meet you . You 've gone to a lot of trouble . Indeed we have . You will be a great help to us . I would n't count on it . Good . Very good . Do not enjoy yourself too much on Risa . Your visor will be returned . First , I want to show you something . Show me something ? A nice trick . I ca n't see anything without the visor . That is not quite true . Allow me to demonstrate . I now have direct access to his visual cortex . He has no choice but to see what I wish . I can feed him any image . He will be unable to ignore it . His galvanic skin response has increased nine percent . It seems La Forge , like many humans , has a low tolerance for watching others suffer . - Why are you doing this ? - I 'm sorry , Commander . He 's looking at a beautiful meadow , green trees , birds , a blue sky . The heartbeat slows . The galvanic skin response drops . The body responds to our stimuli . He is incapable of maintaining control of his own responses . Watch as I change the stimuli again . Once our work is done , La Forge will act normally , unaware of his conditioning . The perfect tool for our purpose . Will there be any physical evidence ? None , Commander . That is why we chose La Forge . The utilization of his pre-existing neural implants makes our work impossible to detect . How will we be certain of success ? I will program him to perform a series of tests , both before he leaves us and after he returns . We 'll be able to verify his effectiveness . Notice that his heart rate has slowed . He is becoming accustomed to the horrors he is witnessing . So ... .. we change horrors . That 's where the rebels must be hiding . The actinides in the asteroids protect them from our sensors . They might attack a freighter , but I doubt they would challenge a Federation starship . Especially with the Federation furnishing them support . You would test the Captain 's word with me , Kell ? Is it because I have no honour that you expect me to be disloyal ? Wrong of me to ask . My apologies . Capt Picard does not lie . If he says there is no Federation assistance , there is none . Good . I risked my own reputation and honour coming to Picard . He will not disappoint you . If that is all ... Some members of the High Council would thank you , Worf . Thank me ? For killing Duras . No doubt , had he lived , he would have headed the Council . Many did not look forward to that . My motives were personal , not political . Thanks . Where are we , Mr . La Forge ? This is ten-forward . Who is that man over there ? That 's Chief O'Brien . How long has he served with you ? Almost four years . I want you to kill him . OK . Take this phaser and kill Chief O'Brien . Finally , I think I 've found it ... .. the power to transporter seven ... Freeze simulations . Commander , did you understand my request ? Well , I ... It 's just ... - I do n't ... - Look at me . - What did I ask you to do ? - Kill Chief O'Brien . Then do as I asked . Resume program . Chief . Good , Mr . La Forge . Very good . Why do n't you enjoy a drink with your friends ? - Mind if I join you , guys ? - Sure . He still hesitated . Prepare the equipment for another session . Captain 's log , star date 44896.9 . - Welcome back , Geordi . - Data ! - How was the seminar ? - Very informative ! I 'll tell you about it . It is fortunate we could coordinate your return on the cruiser . When I heard the Enterprise went to Krios , I thought I might be forced to endure a few more weeks on Risa . I 'm sorry you did not enjoy yourself . - I was joking . - Joking ? " Forced to endure . " Your actual intent was to emphasize that you did enjoy yourself . Yes . I see how that could be considered quite amusing . I missed you , Data ! - Cmdr La Forge . - Permission to come aboard . - Granted . Welcome back . - Thank you , sir . Cmdr La Forge is my chief engineer . He 's been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence on Risa . I 'm glad we got you back . We need you . Data tells me the Federation has been accused of aiding rebels . - You had a good time . - Does it show ? You 're more relaxed than I 've ever seen you . Captain , Governor Vagh is ready to meet with you . Very well . We will transport down to the surface immediately . Ambassador . - Cmdr Riker . - What is it , Data ? Our sensors detect an energy fluctuation in the E-band . The E-band ? That 's unusual . What 's the source ? Unknown , sir . E-band emissions are difficult to localize . Collapsing protostars can emit E-band bursts . Yes , sir . There are no protostars in this sector . - Better do a complete scan . - Yes , sir . The Carnelians have done the most work on artificial intelligence . I spent a lot of time in their seminars . I get the feeling something special happened on this vacation . I 'm not talking about computers . I did take second place in a chess tournament . And I swam a lot . The water is very calm on Risa . I ate enough for 12 people . The food is terrific . They 've got a chocolate that you would love . - And that 's all ? - Yeah . - There was this ... - Yes ? Her name is Jonek . But you would n't want to hear about that . Better get ready for duty . Nice talking to you . We talk , we socialize , we waste time , and the insurrection continues to grow . These rebels need to be crushed , not coddled . Governor , it does not matter what you or I think . The High Council 's wishes are clear . The Council should be more interested in Federation interference . Governor , what do you think the Federation has done ? Your medical supplies have reached the rebels . We make no effort to restrict medical supplies . Are your weapons also freely available ? No , they are not ! Then explain this . - You took this from the rebels ? - That and many more like it . As you wish . I have hundreds more . Even if these are genuine , a third party must have been involved . The Federation is not in the business of supplying arms to rebels . This is the only Klingon colony on the border of Federation space . You can not deny that Starfleet would be happy to see Krios gain its independence . It would reduce your vulnerability to an attack . Governor , you speak as if we are enemies , not allies . And you speak the lies of a taar'chek ! Gentlemen ! You swear well , Picard . You must have Klingon blood in your veins . Governor , I will report to you when analysis of that weapon is complete . Captain , Commander ... Enterprise , three to transport . Inter-cooler flux down to five percent . Plasma deviation steady at 0.72 . Aye , sir . If you keep up this efficiency , I 'll go back to Risa . Just run through a level-four series , then call it a night . Red Torian , please . Thank you . I 'm sorry ! - My glass , it just slipped . - It 's nothing . Just cold . - But you 're all soaked ! - It 's nothing serious . - Let me wipe it up . - I 'll change . - You sure ? - Do n't think about it , Commander . Energy flow is within normal parameters , from the pre-fire chamber to the aperture . Rapid nadion pulse , right on target . Beam-control assembly , safety interlock . Both checked out . Beam-width intensity controls also responding correctly . Energy-cell usage constant at 1.05 megajoules per second . Curious . The efficiency reading is well above Starfleet specifications . Yeah , by quite a bit . 94.1 percent efficiency . Our most efficient discharge crystal fires with 86.5 percent efficiency . Let 's look at the wave pattern of the emission . That might tell us why . Pulse frequency out of pre-fired chamber reads steady . There ! That 's not right . Then it 's definitely not Starfleet issue . There ca n't be many systems that use terahertz . 327 , to our knowledge . We can probably achieve a match with a computer search . It will take approximately three hours . I think we can narrow this down with common sense . Who has the most to gain from a conflict between the Klingon Empire and the Federation ? The Romulans . They fashioned a perfect rifle but charged it from their own sources . So the discharge crystal and the emission correspond to those in a Romulan disruptor . The Romulans have no interest in Kriosian independence . This planet is too far away . They would want to drive the Federation and the Empire apart . Our alliance is all that has kept them in check . Romulan replications using stolen Federation technology ? It 's a typical Romulan ploy . An attempt to sow dissension and mistrust . Commander , you 've done very well . I thank you on behalf of the Empire . Of course . My staff will give their full cooperation . You may go . - Another E-band blip ? - Yes , sir , but at a different intensity . It did not originate in the same location . If it 's changed intensity , it ca n't be a protostar . That is a reasonable assumption . Is there any known instance of the Romulans using E-band ? Not to my knowledge , sir . Can you track the source ? We can reconfigure the primary sensor array . If we narrow the scan to E-band , we might be able to calculate a directional vector . - But only for more occurrences . - Do it . Computer , reroute the power in the cargo-bay-four transporter to the auxiliary replicator system . Please verify command with necessary protocol . Initiate protocol 364-B . Verified priority clearance . Recognize La Forge , data 2997 . Acknowledged . Power has been rerouted through power-distribution system code number 44762 . Now , redirect transporter mode to the planetary sensor array . Affirmative . Erasure process is proceeding . Sir , we are being hailed by Governor Vagh . On screen , Mr . Worf . - Governor . - You astonish me , Picard . Did you believe you would succeed , that we are blind ? I do n't understand . We intercepted the weapons you tried to transport . Governor , I assure you ... Do not insult us both by denying it . Maintain your position . Do not attempt to leave orbit . Klingon attack cruiser uncloaking , sir . On screen . Two birds of prey approaching . Sensors confirm an unauthorized transporter beam at 1123 hours . - Do you know which transporter ? - I 'm not sure . Whoever did it used the planetary array to bypass the sensors . - And the transporter logs ? - They 're blank . How many people are capable of this ? I 'm not even sure how it was done yet . As soon as I find out , I can give you an answer . Not many . - How long do we have ? - A few hours . Mr . La Forge , recommendations ? It might be possible to trace power flows at the time of transport . Make it so . The primary plasma system does not indicate a power drain . Then whoever used it must have bypassed the primary feeds . Tracking power from the secondary systems . No surges to the transporters indicated . Damn ! Who could have pulled this off ? Try the life-support power flows . No abnormal surges indicated . Replicator wave guides ? There ! That 's not a replicator energy pattern . Trace it . - Cargo bay four . - Security to cargo bay four . I 've run a level-one diagnostic . The unit was n't tampered with . This has to be the transfer point . Perhaps they reprogrammed the memory chips to erase any record . You 're talking about 30 or 40 chips in half-a-dozen systems . Procedure requires that I ask where you were at 1123 hours . I was with Keiko , in the arboretum . I was on the bridge . I was in my quarters . - Was anyone with you ? - No , I was alone . Costa was on duty . I 'm sure he 's got 20 witnesses . Then someone on board is n't what he or she seems to be . Data , let 's do a detailed scan on every chip . There 's got to be some trail we can follow . The isolinear chips were altered ? Programmed to erase all commands once the transfer was complete . With the chips erased , what evidence remained ? The erasures were complete . An analysis of the subatomic structure revealed an almost undetectable residual pattern . We could reconstruct the perpetrator 's authorization code . - Do you have any ideas ? - No , sir . Everyone with the necessary skills has an alibi , except for me . I was alone in my quarters . It wo n't be easy . A lot of people were there . - Riker to Data . - Yes , Commander ? Sensors have picked up another E-emission . Acknowledged . I will be there shortly . E-band emission ? We have been picking up a curious intermittent blip . Cmdr Riker has speculated it is a Romulan transmission . - I 'm tracking its source . - Proceed . Thank you , Mr . La Forge . We do not have much time . Vagh is not noted for his patience . Assure him that we are doing everything possible and advise him that , if necessary , I will defend my ship . With your permission , I will transport down . Of course . May I suggest you invite Governor Vagh to personally witness your ongoing investigation ? - Do you think he will come ? - I will try to ensure that he does . Qapla ' , Picard . Qapla ' , Ambassador . Come in , Mr . La Forge . I will transport to the surface and return with Governor Vagh . Your captain will bring him to the cargo bay . I want you to kill him there in front of witnesses . Use a hand phaser . When he is dead , you will claim that you acted on behalf of Starfleet , in support of Kriosian independence . I understand . La Forge to O'Brien . Go ahead , Commander . What can I do for you ? Nothing . Chief , I 'm sorry to disturb you . I 'm sorry . Hiya , Doc . Geordi . What can I do for you ? I just ca n't seem to get any sleep . I hope you can help . Sit down . Let 's take a look . You could n't sleep at all ? I was restless . I kept waking up . Would you take off your visor , please ? Is there something on your mind ? No . I do n't think so . Well , everybody goes through bouts of insomnia . It 's probably nothing . A slight dilation of the blood vessels . Nothing serious . What about your visor ? Has it been giving you problems ? Nothing out of the ordinary . Still , it might be good to have it examined at Star base 36 next month . In the meantime , I will get you a somnetic inducer to put by your bed . Thanks , Doc . I 'm sure I 'll be fine . Energize . Governor Vagh , thank you for coming . You can thank Ambassador Kell . I am here against my better judgement . Captain , I think that the Governor should see the investigation under way in the cargo bay . Of course . From inside the Enterprise ? The first and third blips were clearly generated onboard the ship . - The second came from the surface . - Generated by what ? Unknown , sir . We have a known spy and unexplained signals on board . It 's reasonable to assume they 're related . We need to know who , when , why . Or we may go to war . Yes , sir . Computer . Run an analysis of all known Romulan transmission formats . All bands . Identify commonalities with displayed wave form . No commonalities noted . Does this wave form match any known format ? Negative . Broaden search beyond communications . Does the wave pattern conform to any natural phenomenon , cryptographic formats or life-form emissions ? The signal corresponds to a wavelength spectrum similar to human neural frequencies . - As in a human-brainwave pattern ? - Affirmative . What kind of receiver could process these signals ? A system designed to modify the electromagnetic spectrum and carry messages directly to the human brain . Computer . Link with the shuttle 's onboard system . Access the isolinear storage assembly . Scan all chips which contain mission logs . Note any discrepancies . No discrepancies noted . Perform a level-five diagnostic on navigational and power systems . The components specified are all within normal tolerances . Computer , scan the shuttle 's structural integrity . Submicroscopic deformations are present in the nose section and the aft thrusters . Probable cause of these variations ? The shuttle has been subjected to stress from a tractor beam . All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in the structural alloys which allows us to trace our material . - Cmdr La Forge . - What , Chief ? Could you look at the buffers ? With what 's happened , I 'm not sure they are reliable . Sure . Let 's take a look . Computer , I am reading anomalous variations in the molecular structure of these memory chips . Confirm . Analysis confirmed . - Probable cause ? - Replication . Compare these variations with Romulan replication patterns . The patterns are identical . Maybe we should run a diagnostic on those coils . Right , Commander . Data to La Forge . Report , please . Geordi ! Please respond . Computer , current location of Cmdr La Forge . Cargo bay four . - Sir ? - That is an order . Mr . Worf , get him out . Arming our enemies is not enough . Now the Federation would murder me to achieve its aims . Governor , if I could explain this , I would . I believe I can help , Captain . I have determined that La Forge was abducted by Romulans en route to Risa . It is likely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot . I saw no evidence of Romulans . We just witnessed him acting alone . No , sir , you did not . I do not believe the Commander is acting of his own accord . He has been receiving signals through his visor . Signals which carry direct commands to his brain . I have surmised that La Forge was conditioned by Romulans , a process referred to historically , and inaccurately , as brainwashing . To what end ? Why would the Romulans kill me ? The Romulans want to destroy the Federation-Klingon alliance . If Mr . That is not possible . The signals had to be transmitted close to the visor . Are you suggesting an accomplice in close proximity to Mr . La Forge ? Yes , sir . This Romulan accomplice , who is he ? I have narrowed the list to the only two people with Cmdr La Forge all three times a transmission was recorded . Capt Picard and Ambassador Kell . One of them may be concealing an E-band transmitter . - If they agree to be searched ... - I am a Klingon ! An emissary of the High Council . I will not be searched by anyone on this ship . I am forced to agree , Captain . We will take the Ambassador with us and search him ourselves . Captain , I believe it to be in all our interests if I remain aboard . I formally request asylum . I will certainly grant you asylum . When you have been absolved of this crime . But I remember everything ! It did happen ! I remember being on Risa . I know you do . Just take that memory and put it aside for a moment . Tell me everything you remember about the shuttlecraft trip after you left the Enterprise . Well , I was just trying to get in the mood . I played music . I talked to the computer . You know those long trips . When you saw the Romulan ship , did you call us ? No , the first thing I did ... Wait a minute . But that 's ... It 'll take time , Geordi . A long time . But we will reconstruct your memory . Together . I 'm just not sure . About anything . Believe it or not , that 's a good sign . A beginning . Now , let 's go back to the shuttlecraft . There was a Romulan ship . The first thing you did was ... ? 
@@5225141 It 's a beautiful day , is n't it ? So far , but they 're calling for storms later . Well , you know the heartland , some things can change in a minute . - Is everyone assembled ? - Twenty-four hours is n't a lot of notice . Will you give me a heads-up as to the nature of your remarks ? Just one of my customary motivational speeches you 've heard hundreds of times . - How are you ? Good to see you . - How you doing ? - Good morning . Good to see you . - Good morning . - Good morning . Good to see you . - Thank you . Fire up the troops ! The plant made a profit this quarter for the first time in two years . My people are expecting a pat on the back , and they deserve to get it . I 'll try not to disappoint them . Thank you . Thank you . As most of you know you 've all worked extremely hard this past year and you should all be proud of yourselves . Due to management failures beyond your control this plant will be closing effective immediately . Good luck to all of you . You just fired 2500 people and blamed it on me . One day you 'll thank me . Smallville is n't in your future . - It 's just a brief chapter in your biography . - Do n't do this . We live in a meritocracy , Lex . The weak get left behind . The plant was n't producing . I had no other options . Spare me the corporate barbarian spiel . Those people have husbands and wives , children , mortgages . We 're in business to make profits , not friends ! Do n't let your emotions get in the way of making tough decisions ! Do n't lecture me about letting emotions get in the way . This plant was showing a profit . You 're shutting it down because I would n't go work for you in Metropolis . Well , your training is over ! You 're coming home , son ! Pete , I need your opinion . Classic black or traditional red ? For what ? My tie-cummerbund combo . I got ta get my tux order in today . If I were you , I 'd stick with the traditional black . - This is no time to get adventurous . - You 're right . I do n't know , Clark . Red always looks good on you . Then red it is . Thanks . Now I got ta go make a call and change my order . I do n't want people mistaking us for twins . Yeah , because that happens all the time . You seem really excited about the dance . I am , but between the tickets , the tux and buying the flowers , it gets expensive . You should try finding the right dress . Guess the limo 's out . I 'm actually thinking of asking Lex if I can borrow his . My lips are sealed . Chloe ? They 're closing the LuthorCorp plant . - So you heard . - The Ledger rushed a special edition . They have n't done that since the meteor shower . I talked to Chloe . She 's pretty upset . I spoke to her father . He 's in shock . I do n't blame him . - How 's this gon na affect us ? - That plant was Smallville 's biggest employer . Shutting it down is gon na have a domino effect . I ca n't believe Lex would run it into the ground in less than a year . Why are you blaming Lex ? His dad closed the plant . Whatever issues Lionel Luthor has with his son have now cost half the town their jobs . You should be happy , then . It means Lex is going back to Metropolis and out of our lives . The plant closing is gon na hurt a lot of people , Clark . I know , Dad . It 's just ... Lex cares about the town . He said he had big plans . The road to hell is paved with good intentions . Okay . Turn . We 're almost there . All right . - Okay . - Stop . Open your eyes . Wow ! Why are you being so mysterious ? - Ca n't a guy plan a picnic for his girlfriend ? - I 'm not complaining . It 's just kind of spontaneous . Are you saying I 'm usually boring ? I 'm saying this is very nice . I 'm just wondering what the occasion is . It 's to thank you for everything . It 's been a difficult year , and you 've stood by me . I pushed you away , and you could have made other choices . You did n't . We 've been together a long time . I 'd never abandon you when you needed me . There 's something I want to tell you . I think it 's the right thing for me to do . When I found my dad 's medals , I felt he was telling me which path I should take . - You ca n't do this for your father . - I 'm not . I 'm doing it for us . Please , do n't be mad . It 's just so fast , you know ? I need some time to process it . I do n't have a lot of time . I ship out for basic training Saturday night . What about graduation ? The only thing I 'm gon na miss in Smallville is you . Will you wait for me ? Clark , I got your messages , but I 've been having a bad day . Nice paperweight . Yeah , very unique . Sure you can afford being seen with the town pariah ? I 'll take my chances . Just tell people the truth . Then I get stuck with the incompetence rap . Being reviled is the lesser evil . I guess you 're going back to Metropolis , then . That 's why my father orchestrated his coup , but this is n't over . - You have a plan ? - Maybe . You have a lot of work to do . Clark , thanks for stopping by . It means a lot . What are friends for ? Thought I 'd find you here . My dad and I ca n't really do the whole depressed thing together , so ... If you 're not up for Saturday night , I 'd understand . You kidding me ? It 's the only thing I have to look forward to right now . Besides , I want to enjoy all the quaint Smallville High customs while I still can . Why ? Where are you going ? My dad 's talking about moving us back to Metropolis permanently . You 're gon na miss me , right ? Do you even have to ask ? Just promise me Saturday night 's gon na be great . It 'll be a night you wo n't forget . I appreciate you coming . My father does n't know about this meeting , and I 'd like to keep it that way . When I first came here people assumed I was just another glaring example of nepotism unskilled and promoted over the heads of the more competent and deserving . But I 'd like to think the people in this room feel differently . If we can raise the capital for an employee-led buyout ... - ... we can keep the plant running . - Buyout ? I can raise nearly 90%% of the capital . What about the rest ? We 're supposed to mortgage our houses ? It 's a risk , I know . But in exchange , the investors will become minority owners . I 'm offering you the chance to take control of your own destiny . Stand with me , and we 'll win . Clark . Out wandering the streets of Smallville ? What is it ? I just found out that Chloe might be leaving for good . Not sure I really believe it 's true . I know what you mean . You do ? Whitney 's going off to join the Marines . That 's intense . He told me he was doing it for us . Asked if I 'd wait for him . Really ? What did you say ? Nothing . I kind of just stood there in stunned silence . One day he 's worried about his English paper and the next , he 's putting on a uniform and saving the world . So you did n't commit ? I told him I was n't sure . When does he head out ? Saturday night . Me neither . Guess we get left behind , Clark . What do you think caused the explosion ? Son , my guess is it was a leaky fuel line . The fumes must have ignited the fertilizer in the truck . I should have checked it better . - I 'm glad it was me and not one of you guys . - Oh , sweetheart . The truth is , I barely felt the heat this time . And the debris did n't leave any bruises . As you get older , your body must be getting stronger . You 're not in a hurry to pack ? That 's because I 'm not leaving . Accept your fate , Lex . It 's time to move on . I 'm forcing a vote of the board of directors to accept an employee buyout of the plant . What are you gon na do ? Convince the employees to take out a second mortgage ? - Cash in their IRAs . What will you do about the rest of the money ? Take the buyout now , and you can keep your dignity . - That 's more than you left me . - That 's very gracious of you , son . You might wan na look at this first . You 've bought the Smallville Savings and Loan . Go ahead , lead your buyout . But remember , I own your employees ' mortgages . As soon as they begin missing payments I wo n't hesitate to foreclose on each and every one of them . They 'll be homeless , and it will be your fault . You ready to accept that kind of responsibility ? If you 're going to take me on , son you 're gon na have to bring your game up to a whole different level . - Where have you been ? - I went to pick up my dress . - We have a problem . - You ca n't go . I was gon na ask Lex if I could borrow his limo , but with the plant-- Clark , I 'll drive . - Ruins the whole Prince Charming vibe . Cinderella was never my role model . - Why the Marines ? - I do n't know . It 's just something I got ta do . - So Whitney 's off to fight evil for Uncle Sam . - I heard . That technically makes Lana a free agent . He asked her to wait for him . Long-distance relationships never work . People change , have different experiences . It 's kind of like us , you know ? After a couple of weeks , you 'll forget all about me . Chloe ! Okay , I just have this horrible nightmare that you 'll rush to the bus station after Whitney leaves and profess your undying love for Lana , and I 'll be waiting at the gym alone . If you do that to me , Clark , I 'll never speak to you again . Okay , I said it . Chloe . All right , I feel better now . If I could just have one minute of your time , Clark . - How do you know my name ? - Roger Nixon . I 'm a journalist with the Inquisitor , and I would like to write a story about you . Thanks , but I 'm really not interested . Why were n't you hurt in that explosion ? You were in the truck on the farm . I was nowhere near that truck . Am I missing something interesting ? Lex ? You know my name , but I do n't know yours . Roger Nixon . I work for the Inquisitor . When is someone gon na put that bad excuse for a tabloid out of its misery ? It was nice meeting you , Lex . I 'm sure we 'll talk again soon , Clark . What was that all about ? He wants to do a story on me , make me out to be some kind of hero . I do n't intend to . If he gives you any more trouble , let me know . Hi , son . Something wrong ? A journalist from the Inquisitor wants to do a story on me . He knows I was in the truck . I do n't think it was an accident . I think he set it up to test me . How did he know you would survive ? He must have seen me do something before . Look , I swear , ever since Phelan , I 've been so careful . Clark , it 's not your fault . - But what do I do ? - Carry on , go to school , go to the dance and if this reporter 's really got something , I 'm sure he 'll come talk to us . What else ? I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship . Are you sure ? I saw it on his desk . It 's the missing piece . He must have found it in the field . Your mother 's right , son . We 'll just keep our heads low . So when you do your chores , do n't use your abilities . Whatever you do , stay away from that storm cellar . You wanted to see me , Lex ? I 'm surprised you even remembered my name . I warned you to stay away from the Kents . Let me guess . This is where you remind me of all the terrible things you can have done to me . As I 'm sure you 're well aware , I 'm a little preoccupied at the moment . I do n't have time to deal with your annoyances . Well , what I have discovered is beyond you and your problems and your threats . This newfound self-assurance does n't suit you , Roger . Be nice , Lex , or I may not let you bid on my discovery . What was found out there has nothing to do with the Kents or with you . Are you certain ? Roger , for all your bravado , you have yet to show me anything . I 'll show you all the evidence you need tonight . And you 'll see for yourself . There 's a whole lot more to your friend Clark Kent than meets the eye . - I swear , if you harass Clark or his parents-- Who said anything about harassment ? Maybe I 'll just tell them the truth , that you turned me on to them . And if you 're not interested in what I have , I know of another Luthor who will be . You are playing a very dangerous game . You 'd better pray you 're not wrong . Mom , can you give me a hand with this ? Who 's there ? It 's me , Clark . Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - Really ? You seem a little tense . Thought you were holed up in the mansion . Well , I needed to clear my head . Took a drive , ended up here . I did n't mean to bother you on your big day . I got a little time . Chloe 's picking me up . That 's very progressive . What happened to the truck ? A farming accident . You know how it is . So how goes the bailout ? I 'm not sure , Clark . I think it 's gon na get ugly before it gets better . My father 's dead set against me succeeding . Why would your father be against the plant ? We have a complicated relationship , Clark . My father wants me to believe it 's built on trust , but it 's not . It 's built on lies and deceit . Any relationship with that foundation is destined to fail . - Lucky we do n't have that problem . - Lucky us . - I hope you feel the same way . - I do . What do you think 's gon na happen ? I do n't know . Just got a bad feeling like when you can smell the air change before a storm . Storms are a way of life around here , Lex . The trick is to not get caught out in the open . Look after yourself . It 's hard to believe . I thought my whole life was in that trophy case . Now it all seems so trivial . We should get you to the bus station . My bus does n't leave for an hour . How about we go check out the gym ? Okay . It 's beautiful . Where is everyone ? Hour before the dance , the setup committee goes home to get ready . You 're missing the spring formal because of me . We still have time for one last dance . I 'm sorry I did n't tell you before I enlisted . I think you 're very brave . Hi . What do you think ? Too pink ? No . You- You look beautiful . Thank you . You clean up nicely yourself . What happened to the red tie ? Instinct told me it was the wrong way to go . - Is that for me ? - Oh , yeah . Oh , wow ! It 's beautiful . Oh , I have yours ! Okay . Oh , did I get you ? We should go . Yeah . Well , here we go . - I 'll get the door . - Okay . - Thanks . Looks like a storm 's coming . - Yeah . - In ? - In . - This is crazy ! - I know . - You okay ? - Let 's go . Let 's get inside ! Wow , you guys look great . Well , thank you , Ms . Rivers . It 's faux Wang . - Hi . - Hi , Erica . - Oh , yeah , sure . I 'll just be a sec . I think he wants proof that this night actually happened . - Well , I guess this is it . - Good luck , Whitney . Lana , can I have a minute alone with Clark ? Sure . I 'll bring the truck around . Thanks . You and I have had a weird year . I started out thinking you just wanted to steal Lana . I 'm not trying to make excuses , but I did some things I 'm not proud of . I 'm sorry , Clark . I appreciate that . Listen , Clark , there 's something I wan na ask you , a favor . Okay . Lana 's not sure how she feels about our relationship right now . But I am . I need you to look after her until I get back . I really do n't know what to say . Say yes . Okay . Clark ? I promise . Thanks . Good luck . Do you have everything ? - You 're only allowed one bag . - I 'd never make it as a Marine . I want you to have this for luck . I wo n't lose it this time . Goodbye , Lana . I loved you the first moment that I saw you . I 'll still love you when I see you again . Oh , Roger . Baby you are going to be filthy rich ! - Hey . - Hey , Chloe 's having a great time . - I promised her a night she 'd never forget . - I 'm glad you finally stepped up . Yeah , me too . - Hey , I like these guys . - Yeah . Remy Zero ! I love this song . - This is one of Chloe 's favorite songs . - Why do you think I requested it ? Now , that 's what I 'm talking about ! - May I have this dance ? - Of course . - We got ta get to the storm cellar ! - What about Clark ? The school 's on the other side of town ! He 'll be fine ! Mr . Kent ! - Who the hell are you ? - Roger Nixon , Metropolis In-You 're the reporter who threatened Clark ! - Do n't do anything ! - Why not ? He tried to kill our son . - Did you blow up that truck ? - I knew it would n't hurt him . No , please ! - Who sent you ? Lex Luthor ? ! - Jonathan , please ! - Was it Lex Luthor ? ! - I do n't need Lex Luthor . - I 'll tell the entire world about your son ! - You will not ! No ! Jon-Get up , come on ! Jonathan , look ! Jonathan , the tornado ! But he knows everything ! - I will not let him destroy this family ! - No ! Please ! Jonathan ! Clark Kent , man of mystery . - How 's that ? - The song , the tux tonight . - And I 'm still here . - Yeah , you are . Stop the music , please . Excuse me for a second . Can I have everyone 's attention , please ? Thank you . The National Weather Service has just issued a tornado warning . Three funnels were spotted heading towards Smallville . Now , please , everyone , stay calm . The twisters are gon na set down south of here , but for your own safety no one will be allowed to leave the gym . The bus station 's south of town . Lana 's there . Do n't worry . I 'm sure she 's home by now . You know what ? I 'll go call her on my cell , and you wait here . Clark ? Clark ? Damn you , Nixon ! So you 're using your mother 's stock to fund the buyout . That 's your secret source . You may get the plant , but you 're putting your employees ' homes on the line . Forfeiting your own future . Or forging a new destiny free from you . You 're not my enemy . You 're my son . I never saw the distinction . When Alexander the Great was dying , his generals asked who he would leave his empire to if he would appoint a successor who would keep the legacy intact prevent generations of bloodshed . His answer was simple : " I leave it to the strongest . " I believe the term is , " Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war . " I 'll bury you and everyone in Smallville who takes your side . No ! Lex ! Lex ! Lex ! Help me , Lex ! Lex ! Ca n't move ! Help me ! Lex ! Son , please ! Damn it ! Clark ! Lana ! Clark ! No !

Jolene Millman , in Political Liaison , hit " reply , " which ... Margaret , I 'm sorry . I 'm gon na have ... I hung in there , but you passed the point when I stopped caring . If you 're curious , it was around " raisin muffin . " - I 'll leave you two alone . - Fix the e-mail . - Who 'd you find ? - Bacon and Calhoun . I know Bacon . - She favors campaign finance reform ? - Aggressively . - The leadership will hate them both . - What do you want me to do ? - Meet with the leadership offices . - You want me to meet with the leaders ? No , meet their guys outside the building , over a meal . The president ca n't think we 'll get anywhere , can he ? The president does n't think we 'll get anywhere , right ? No . - What happened with the e-mail ? - Has to do with the Fitness Council . - Who 'd you find ? - Bacon and Calhoun . - Not in a million years . - What are you doing ? It 's our turn with the boys . - Good luck . Do you want me to do the talking ? - Why ? - Just asking . Morning . Morning . We all know each other . - Can I interrupt for a moment ? - Sure . What will come from your recommendation ? Well , actually , it 'll be Sam 's recommendation to the president . I 'm just helping out . What do you think will be the consequence ? Major , I would imagine the consequences to be little . I would imagine it to be very little . If the president orders that gays can serve openly that 's how it 'll be . Anyone who disobeys can stand court-martial . The president can give all the orders he wants . It takes an act of Congress to amend the Uniform Code which makes sodomy a crime . End of story . - I guess it 'll be a short meeting . - Yeah . There will be 25,000 wooden eggs and 7500 other eggs . What are the other eggs ? - The other eggs are ... - Real eggs . - Mandy 's waiting . - 25,000 wooden eggs . - Added to the 7500 eggs that are ... . - They 're just regular eggs . - Right . Is that it ? Yeah . Who has it ? I do n't know . But somebody does . Yeah . Okay . I 'm gon na read it now . Go back to your office and do n't answer any questions . You 'll call me when you 're done reading ? I 'd count on it . Soft money renders the 1974 Campaign Reform Act toothless . Soft-money contributions , which were designed for party building only eviscerate election controls . We are , by definition , corrupt . - I would n't say that . - No , but this money is n't 1 Os and 20s . It 's coming in in denominations of 100 , 200 , 500,000 dollars ! It comes from special interests whose interests are n't the same as those who do n't have money . It 's going to issue ads and candidates . It 's called free speech . If the airplane industry wants to back a candidate , they can . If big tobacco wants to wave a sign , they are free to do so . That 's free speech , money is n't . I like it when Josh comes here and teaches us a lesson we richly deserve . I came at the request of Leo McGarry . The president is strongly considering John Branford Bacon and Patty Calhoun to fill the two seats . We 've already got our guys . - It 's Kalen . - Grant Kalen and Joe Barkley . People who oppose any campaign finance reform . I thought you liked Kalen . He 's elected Democrats from Indiana . He 's raised money in Indiana . Barkley says people can spend whatever they want on politics . So does the Supreme Court . We ca n't do this every time Bartlet wants to make the world better . The party leadership 's gon na choose a Republican and a Democrat . - The president makes FEC appointments . - The Senate confirms them . I 'm speaking for the majority leader . Embarrass us , and we 'll give the same back to you . Any legislation you want off the table will show up . Our greatest hits : 541 , school prayer , family support , entertainment decency . - English as the national language . - That will be our leadoff hitter . - Why not just not confirm our guys ? - We 'll do that too . In addition to voting down our nominees there will be retribution for nominating them ? Yes . You know why ? Because you know you 're gon na lose , and we 're gon na look bad winning . I reject maintaining free speech through government regulation . - Reject what you want . - What ? Reject whatever you want . This was a fool 's errand for me and the president knew it . This was a test balloon , an " out of curiosity , what if " meeting . We got ta go . - I 'm going to lunch . - The president wo n't eat his . Why is he dissatisfied ? - It 's entirely vegetables . - It 's a salad . He 'd prefer a sandwich . Roast beef , pastrami , steak . He will eat it , and if he does n't like it , he knows where to put it . I do n't think I will tell him that , but I appreciate your help . - If it ai n't broke ... . - " Do n't ask , do n't tell " works . It does n't . Want to know how much it does n't ? - 1145 gays were discharged in 1998 . - That 's a record . A 92% increase since " do n't ask , do n't tell . " 414 Air Force discharges , the highest in two decades . 271 of them during basic training at Lackland Air Force Base . - What 's going on there ? - I do n't like your humor . Yeah . Come here a sec . You 're doing good . - What ? - I know what the paper is . A strategy memo Mandy wrote . - Strategy to do what ? - Beat us . - Did you read it ? Is it bad ? - Yeah . Let 's go to my office . How 'd it go ? - How do you know to be here ? - I see you out your office window . - Why are you in my office ? - Looking for you out the window . How 'd it go ? - It went fine . - Fine ? You do n't want to say more ? I do n't , and you know I do n't because I 'm not . - This is our time together . - I ca n't mess around . I need to be prepped on English as the national language . - Why ? - Might come up . Because ... . It does n't matter . Did n't I just tell you I ca n't mess around ? - Bullet points ? Give me 30 minutes . - Thank you . Toby said to come by as soon as you got back . I 'm not taking any calls . I 'll call them back . " The reality of the Bartlet White House is a flood of mistakes . An agenda stalled and lacking a coherent strategy . An administration plagued by indecision . " - Ginger . - What 's going on ? Mandy wrote a manual for Russell , and it 's out . I do n't know where . How bad is it ? She takes us to town . We do n't look like rocket scientists , but we 're not . - Who is it bad for ? - The president and Leo . - Who has this ? - I 'm finding out . Do it quietly . Quickly . - Does he have a minute ? - He 's finishing with the chairman . They almost done ? I 'll wait . You having problems with your e-mail ? Support says the pipeline 's been flooded . It happened when I forwarded an e-mail to people and one tried to reply . E-mail boxes are clogged . Replies are automatically bouncing back and forth at subatomic speed . I 've passed the point where you 're interested , have n't I ? Yeah . - Thank you , Fitz . - Thank you . - Good afternoon . - You here for me ? Is the Philippines redundant ? - It is . That 's the beauty of it . - You 'll have to convince him . - I will . - If you say so . - Who are those guys ? - A meeting on gays in the military . - Why ? - Sam 's trying to build a position . If he comes up with one , let me know . - That explains that . - He wants to put A1-M1 s in Manila . - The president will say it 's redundant . - How much does it cost ? - Not much . 20 billion . - So there 's gon na be a thing . - About what ? Mandy wrote a memo for Russell , and someone 's got it . - Who ? - C.J . 's finding out . That 's politics . She was playing for the other guys . Yeah . There 's some observations the president wo n't be wild about . I move him to the middle . The sense is that he 's aggressive and you take him to safe ground . Do n't worry about it . Do n't worry about it . - Want to see a copy ? - No . Six pages on English as the national language . Stuff on James Madison ... James Madison ? I did n't ask for a damn social studies paper . - Do n't snap at me , Josh . - Donna ... Do n't snap . What 's wrong with everyone today ? It 's been all day . Is it Mandy 's memo ? No . Why is everyone walking around like they 've already lost ? I was n't snapping at you . I did n't realize that you also gave me what I asked for . I thought you just gave me James Madison . Look at the James Madison . It 's gon na help you . Thanks . - How will Madison help you ? - I do n't know . The president wants two reformers on the FEC . Onorato will retaliate with English as the national language . - The president wo n't look good . - Tell me what else I should know . The president wo n't look good fighting that one . You oppose flag burning , school prayer , gays in the military . Say no to this , and they 'll paint a picture ... I understand , Mandy . Fine . I 'm just saying it 's my job to tell you that . I wrote an op memo . We 've written 20 ! - Ever hear of a burn bag ? - They got it off my hard disk . Do you know who has it ? Then there 's not much you can do . Do n't let the president debate English ... It wo n't happen . The president wo n't nominate who he wants to the FEC . Why not ? Because that 's not what we do . All right . - I 'll leave you alone . - Thanks . - Everyone 's feeling this way today ? - Yeah . Okay . Thanks . Hang on . A lot of those cases ... - This report , by the way ... - We can read . We know the report . Lots of cases of gays being discharged came from voluntary statements . These are n't voluntary , not by any definition given by a court . It 's not voluntary if given to a therapist as in Corporal David Blessing 's case . And it is not when it is coerced out through fear intimidation , death threats , and prosecution as in the case of Bob Kiddis , Kevin Keys and four sailors on the Essex . We 'll take care of our guys . - Your guys are looking for jobs . - Those were n't our guys . - Oh , my God . - Attention ! - Good afternoon , Sam . - Mr . Chairman . - How do you do , admiral ? - Good to see you . We have n't met . From Oregon . Percy Fitzwallace . - It 's an honor , admiral . - I imagine it would be . This is Chairman Fitzwallace . They wo n't speak until I speak to them . They 're well-trained . Stand easy . - This Danish for anybody ? - Yes , sir . - We 're not prejudiced . - You just do n't want them serving . - No , I do n't . They pose a threat to discipline and cohesion . That 's what I think too . The military was n't designed as an instrument of social change . Problem is , they said that about me 50 years ago . Blacks should n't serve . It disrupts the unit . Know what ? It did . The unit got over it and changed . I 'm an admiral and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Beat that with a stick . We 'll see you , Ken . Excuse me . Mr . Chairman . Just ... Thanks for stopping in . You 're not gon na get anywhere . The president wanted some exploratory meetings . - I was hoping to find you . I wanted ... - Hang on . - I wanted to ask ... - Hang on . - Is it the Magna Carta ... ? - I 'm finishing a thought . - That 's right . You got ta know I do n't like exploiting our friendship and I do n't like taking advantage of any feelings you have for me . - You have them too . - I do n't . I need to be ready for this . - Do you know who has it ? - Yes . Who has it ? I do . You have it ? You 're gon na write about it ? - Sure . - Why ? - Because it 's news . - It 's not news . Just because it 's entertaining ! It 's news . The president 's media director wrote a memo to a party leader describing his weaknesses . People in the party buy my paper . They 'd like to know what Mandy thinks . - Mandy was n't working here then . - I do n't care where she was working ! She 's a key player , and she says the president 's vulnerable ... Fine . We 'll have a comment for you by day 's end . - None of this is our fault ! - None of what ? Mandy 's letter was pretty accurate . She was working for Russell . You knew why . Why did n't you ask her , " What are we doing wrong ? " Because you knew what she 'd say . There was nothing you could do . You guys are stuck in the mud around here and none of it is the press ' fault . I know you 're frustrated . But that 's nothing compared to the people who voted for you . " We 'll have a comment for you by day 's end " ? When I want the White House to comment on a story , I 'll ask for it . I have to do this work . - I 'd like to go on record ... - There is no record . I have no objection to what somebody does in their own home ... Why does being gay mean you ca n't keep your hands to yourself ? And how can the armed forces lay claim to restraint in that area ? Want me to get the file on sexual harassment in the DOD ? I 've had enough of this . " Do n't ask , do n't tell , do n't pursue " is federal law . It takes an act of Congress to change . If the president was serious about changing it he would not send you in here with me and two junior DOD staffers . He 'd call his staff together and say , " I want a resolution in the House . I want 50 high-profile cosponsors . I want a deal right now . " - Has the president done that ? - The president ... Has the president done that , Sam ? No . Okay , then . Is this meeting anything more than a waste of time ? No . Okay , then . I.T . Support is now accusing me of being a hacker . I said no . I was simply telling people the raisin muffin calorie count was wrong . You do n't believe me , take one of those muffins down to the lab . - I 'll do that . - Will you ? Get me a muffin . Use gloves . Slip it in a bag . I 'll send it to the lab . You 're mocking me now , are n't you ? Yes . Come in . Margaret thinks the FBI 's gon na bust in here any minute . Got a second bit of bad news for you today . - You got new numbers ? - Yeah . How bad is it ? CNNUSA Today puts our job approval at 42% . We dropped five points . In a week ? Unfavorables are higher for the first time . 54% of the country is likely to vote for a Republican in November . We dropped five points ? We did n't do anything last week . I 'll say . This president was elected with 48% of the vote . Without a mandate . - The majority voted for somebody else . - I do n't care . He was elected and sworn in . I was there at the time . It 's not the easiest circumstance ... One victory is n't so bad . One victory stinks for an administration . It 's not the ones we lose that bother me . It 's the ones we do n't try for . And I 'm not too crazy about you questioning my loyalty . The president 's reading the memo . I wish you had n't done that . It 's gon na piss him off . - It 'll be in the paper tomorrow . - Did you find out who has it ? - Danny . - And he 's writing it ? - Right next to the poll numbers . - How do we drop five points ? It happened . Let 's move on . I think the Senate will confirm Bacon and Calhoun . Like English as the national language . We 're not going to let it on the table . - We should n't be afraid ... - He wo n't let it on the table . - Then we 'll take their FEC candidates . - As we always have . - What about you ? - My meeting ? It was the same meeting we 've been having for ... It was fine . I 'm sorry to interrupt . - Who 's got this ? - Danny Concanon . - Why am I finding out about this now ? - We learned about it today . I really did wake up energized this morning . - I never go to bed that way . - I know . Just once I 'd like to end a day feeling as good as when it started . - Are you bothered by this ? - The memo ? Yeah . Yes . We 've heard it before . You drive me to safe ground . - Good . You drive me there . - What did you say ? - And you know it . We 're in neutral because that 's where you say to stay . - You 're wrong . - I 'm not . You want to do this now ? You came to my house , Leo , and you said , " Let 's run for president . " I said , " Why ? " You said , " So you can say what you think . " - Where 'd that part go ? - You tell me . I do n't see a shortage of microphones . What the hell were you waiting for ? Everything you do says , " I do n't wan na be a one-term president . " - Did n't I say put our guys on the FEC ? - No , you did not . No . You said , " Let 's dangle our feet in the water like we do when we want to look like we 're trying . You brought me in on teachers , on capital gains . You brought me in on China and on guns . From where ? You 've never been out there on guns or teachers . You dangle , and I 'm the hall monitor . It 's my job to make sure nobody goes off too far . Josh goes to the Hill on campaign finance , he knows nothing will happen . Sam ca n't push " do n't ask , do n't tell " and everyone knows that . If I said to get aggressive on finance or gays in the military you 'd tell me , " Do n't go too far . " If you said be aggressive , I 'd say : " I serve at the pleasure of the president . " We 'll never know , because you wo n't ... - I have ! Nothing happens ! He was warned , " Do n't show up . You 're in danger . " He said , " I 'm going anyway . " You said no . Prudent or not prudent , this 21-year-old , at $600 a week , said : " I 'm going where I want to , because a man stands up . " Everyone 's waiting for you . I do n't know how much longer . I do n't want to feel like this anymore . You do n't have to . - I do n't wan na go to sleep like this . - You do n't have to . I want to speak . Say it to me . It 's more important than re-election . I want to speak . Say it again . This is more important than re-election . I want to speak now . Now we 're in business . We got our asses kicked , but it 's time to get up . Say it . More important than re-election . I want to speak now . You have a strategy for all this ? What is it ? I 'm gon na try that for a while . The ground game is n't working . We 're gon na put the ball in the air . If we 're gon na walk into walls , I want us running into them . What ? Tell the Hill the president 's named his nominees to the FEC . We 're gon na lose some battles . We might even lose the White House . We wo n't be threatened by issues . We 'll put them front and center . We 'll raise the level of public debate in this country and let that be our legacy . That sound all right to you , Josh ? I serve at the pleasure of the president . I serve at the pleasure of the president . I serve at the pleasure of President Bartlet . I serve at the pleasure of the president . Good . Let 's get in the game . 
@@5225341 That 's me . Jane Quimby . My life is a little complicated right now . I landed my fashion dream job working for her , Gray Chandler Murray . The only problem , they think I 'm an adult . Now I am juggling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion . Two months is a long time . What if Billy 's different ? What if he does n't want to see me ? BEN : You two will figure it out . You know why ? You guys are like this . Jane , I see you 've met my nephew , Eli . Yeah , we ... Nephew ? I 'm pleased to introduce our newest designer , Eli Chandler . That 's a " no " on kissing at work . You and I both know that someone on the inside would like to see us fail . I ca n't do this anymore . Remember . We must impress this Harrods style director at any cost . Hello , losers . Where 's Jane ? Hey , guys . And they to me . Which is why I 've been given complete creative control over your collaboration with my store . I wish I could say that you 're all capable of Harrod 's caliber , but you 're going to have to prove it . Keep in mind , of course , that I will be very , very thorough . Now , in addition to supervising the new collection , I will also be overseeing your contribution to its newest , celebrity face . Who is that ? Oh , my God , it 's ... Aiden Chayse . I 'd like you to meet your design team here at Donovan Decker . How y'all doing ? Who 's Aiden Chayse ? - Are you kidding me ? - Blasphemy . As I 'm sure you 're all aware , Aiden is Hollywood 's most promising young talent . He 's on billboards across the country and the bedroom doors of girls in every country . For the world to see . This is so cool . That is if I , and Mr . Chayse , of course , approve what you 've come up with . It 's up to you to impress . Do n't let us down . JANE : Mr . Chase , so nice to meet you . Something you 'd like to say , Gray ? India . You were one of my top designers . You know what it takes , the hours , the hard work , that they put in to get here . Now I realize that you 're still angry , but treat them with respect . I am living proof that hard work does n't merit respect in your eyes , so save me the noble leader crap . Oh , and Gray ? What was it that you used to say ? Ah . I expect perfection ... is the new Harrod 's style director . Yes . Bummer . Bummer ? This is like an asteroid striking Earth , Billy . How big an asteroid ? Just when I thought to calm down at work , India bursts in , bitchier than ever , stomping around Brian Atwood pumps . Which were actually super cute , which only makes me more annoyed . But , you know what makes me feel better ? What ? The thought I 'll be in a cemetery watching Creature From the Black Lagoon with you . Are we really going to that again ? Come on ! It 's tradition . Do n't you think doing something every year sorta runs the risk like , wearing it out ? Um , no . Are you worn out on Thanksgiving ? Or your birthday ? Yeah , kinda . We 've gone together every year since we were seven . BOY : Lowlife . GIRL : He 's a juvie loser . Yeah , I do n't wan na go anywhere that makes me feel like I do here . Do n't worry . It 'll be dark .  People wo n't even recognize you .  Funny , Jane . Please come . It 'll be fun . You , me , a cemetery and I 'll bring extra Sour Patch Kids . All right , fine . What is this ? This is Renny the teddy bear . I combined our names in honor of our eight week anniversary . I thought we did the anniversary thing last week , Ben ? Did we ? I do n't remember that . Yeah . We had seven layer dip . You made us watch that Brad Pitt movie , Se7en . Well , I did n't make us watch . And it 's a great movie . Powerful ending . And the dip was pretty amazing . Ben , look . I thought we talked about this . The kids rely on me to be a steady guiding influence . I ca n't be running around with teddy bears and eating candy hearts like a teenager in love . Say no more . Loud and clear . And no candy hearts . Ah , special delivery . Scrap those , we need to regroup . Okay . Hear me out on this . Rita said she wants to keep things " under the radar , " in the whole romance department , but does she really mean it ? I 'd go with a " yes " on that . Yeah , normally , even I 'd say just go for it . But I think Jane has a point . Right . But every relationship I 've ever been in , has n't worked out because I did n't do enough . And I do n't want that to happen with Rita . She 's too special . I just want her to know what she means to me . I think she knows . - Cancel it . - Cancel it . - A gorilla-gram ?  - I know . But it 's so cute , my brother 's in love . Yeah , you know , I guess I do like them together . Me , too . All right . I 'm out . Seriously ? Yeah , I have to get to work . I mean , I can stay . If you want me to stay . Do you want me to stay ? No , it 's fine . Look , If you need me to , I totally will . No , you know , it 's fine . I 'll just eat lunch with Carl again . Carl ? Carl , the janitor , Carl ? Look , I 'll call in sick and we can hang out . No . It 's cool . Really . Okay , but only if you 're sure . Are we still on for the movie tomorrow night ? Yeah . All righty , then . Surprise , surprise . PROFESSOR : As with the polygons , the X and Y coordinates of the vertex centroid ... Really , Harper ? You seriously think I 'm gon na take your purse ? Unbelievable . Hey , nobody panic , all right ? I want you all to know I 've been completely rehabilitated . Your valuables will be safe and sound right where they are . Dude . Relax . Oh , thanks for your input , Harper . Do I not look relaxed to you ? Mr . Nutter , when you 've done being disruptive , I 'd like to get on with the class . This is ridiculous . That 's enough . I did n't do anything ! Office . Now . Wow . I know what you 're thinking . Is that right ? Yeah , you 're thinking Gray gave me this job just because I 'm her nephew . Look , I 've never actually been that close with my aunt . That fact actually helps less .  Jane . Look , I love design , okay , I really do . And I 'm good at it . So , the last thing I want is for you to feel like this was handed to me undeserved . Then prove it . I 'm serious . Prove to me that you deserve it . Well , I will . Well , you 'll have to do a whole lot better than this , then . Amateur . Immature . Undisciplined . This is not what Donovan Decker is about , my friend . Maybe we should be . We ? Yeah . Maybe it 's time this whole company was a little less , uh ... I do n't know , stuffy ? Did you just call me stuffy ? Oh , come on , man . That can not be the first time you 've heard that . Okay , boys . Look , you 're both very handsome . So why do n't we all just agree to disagree here ? This is gon na be fun . I know what you 're thinking . You 're a mind reader ? Cool . I 'm not gon na steal your purse . What 's wrong with my purse ? Nothing . It 's fine . If I was looking to steal a purse , which I 'm not , yours would be the first one I 'd go after . You 're just saying that . - So what did you do ? - Which time ? Let 's start with the most recent one . I kinda lost it in class . Lost what ?  My temper . My mind . I do n't know . What about you ? I told my calculus teacher I do n't believe in pop quizzes . Rebel . Too bad you 're not a mind reader . We almost had something in common . Oh , so you read minds ? Palms . Let me see your hands . - Seriously ? - Mmm-hmm . And a loner , but not entirely by choice . You just got out of juvie ? Where does it say that ? It does n't . I just heard it from someone . So we 're basically just holding hands right now ? Sorry . Billy , you 're up . Zoe , do you mind if we discuss your transcripts tomorrow ? I 'm kind of swamped today . Definitely , Miss Shaw . Transcripts ? Pop quiz crusader sounded cooler .  Billy . Miss Shaw . You 're a good kid . I know that . But the fact is , you have some strikes against you and you ca n't afford any misbehavior right now . One unexcused absence , one more time getting sent down here , and ... But it was n't my fault . I know that , Billy , but the judge only agreed to release you early on the condition that he sees your weekly progress reports . Do you ?  What 's the difference ? Difference is that you are not that kid , Billy . I 'm not giving up on you here . You 've got to work with me , okay ? Okay . Hmm . I have to say it 's ... it 's not bad . I 'm actually impressed . Thank you , India . We 're rather proud of it . You should be . Well . I 'm going out to greet Mr . Chayse . He should be here momentarily . Excellent . We 're ready .  Here you go , non-fat latte . Mmm . Uh-uh . India . Okay , such a beautiful face should never look so sad . What 's the matter ? I have to apologize in advance . For what ? I 'm not gon na pretend that you 're gon na love the collection . Oh . Because you probably wo n't . Well , let 's have a look . - Okay . - All right . Of course if you like it , we can move forward , but if you do n't , please do n't hesitate for a second to be vocal . Let 's just say , it 'd mean more coming from you . Fair enough . - Mr . Chayse , how are you ? - Gray . Hi . We 've come up with a line that we think you 're really going to respond to .  - I think it looks great . - Wow . This is a disaster . I 'm really sorry , I ca n't put my face on this . - We 're screwed . - Hold on a minute . We 're not screwed . He just came in here and shot everything down . How are we not screwed ? Okay , let 's just think about it for a minute . Okay . Maybe we are screwed . Tell me we 've got something . Do n't everyone jump in at once . - We have ... - Some seedlings . - We just ... - We do n't need seedlings . We need something that he likes and we need it now . Well , it seems Mr . Chayse wants to move in a different direction . Meaning ? Meaning you lost the collaboration , Jane . Guys , look . It 's nothing personal , I just think , creatively , this might not be the best fit . You should never compromise . Well , I appreciate it , thanks . Actually , Mr . Chayse . If you would n't mind taking a look at this , it 's a slightly different direction . Sure . GRAY :  What are you doing ? It 's a side project I 've been working on . Figured it ca n't hurt to show him , right ? He was walking out of here , anyway . We have nothing to lose . Good enough for a billboard ? Perfect for a billboard . It 's magnificent . Well , thank you . You saved us . We need to talk . Sit down . I said sit down . I know what you did , Jeremy . How did you find out ? I had security cameras installed . I 've seen everything . And I mean everything . - I 'm so sorry , Gray . - And you should be . Do you think this is how I wanted to find out that you and India were an item ?  And when were the cameras installed exactly ? - Eight months ago . - Eight months ? Right . - Everywhere ? - Everywhere . We had fun . Yeah , we 're adults . This is true . And while I find your transgressions to be vile , and in some states illegal ... You have cameras in the copy room ? And audio . But I 'm beginning to think this could actually do us some good . Which is why I want you to smooth things over with India . Get close to her again . Find out what she 's up to . Are you asking me to ... I 'm saying , do what you need to do . Well , I 'm sorry , but yeah , I 'm a little busy with the Harrod 's collaboration , and ... Eli can handle that . That 'll be all . You ... So they walk me into the back room of the Roosevelt , mind you , I still think I 'm just going to meet Leo , and out of nowhere , a hundred people jump out screaming " Happy birthday . " Was Leo really there ? Of course he was . He 's a great guy . Ah , that 's so nice to hear . Then they bring out this huge birthday cake , and it 's great , but the whole time , I 'm thinking , " God , I wish Scarlett was here . - Aw . - Aw . This is all going through my mind , I bend down to blow out the candles , and out of the cake pops Scarlett . - No . - I could n't believe it . That is so cute . It was amazing .  I wish it had lasted with her . We 're famous by association . Own it , girl . Jane , has anyone ever told you , you have an Audrey Hepburn quality ? Totally . Oh , no , I ... You do . It is uncanny . That 's so nice , Mr . Chayse . Call me Aiden . Thank you , Aiden . In her time , Audrey had this certain authenticity that you just do n't see these days . It 's so refreshing to spend time with someone so real . Real as can be . I mean , all you guys , you 're just so much more grounded than all my Hollywood friends . Thanks , man . Yeah . He had something pressing to handle back at the office . I can still see you , Jeremy . Hello , India . How 's life been treating you ? You mean , life since I was unjustly fired and kicked to the curb ? It 's been spectacular . Just spectacular . Buzz off , Jeremy . Thank you so much , Aiden . You guys took me out . Thank you . REPORTER : Hey , over here , Aiden .  WOMAN : Over here , Aiden . Hey , who 's that girl with Aiden ? I do n't know . But she 's gon na be famous tomorrow . MAN : All right . I thought we talked about you being discreet , Jane . Hmm ?  Oh , boy . Seriously ? This is not being careful . If you 're gon na live a double life , it 's probably a good a idea to try and stay off of Perez Hilton . Although they did get my good side . Jane . What ? Did you cancel the gorilla-gram ? Yes . Do n't try and change the subject . You 're not gon na let this go to your head , are you ? It 's just part of my job , Ben . And I 'm not going to let some silly little picture affect me . Can you believe it ? - Hey , Jane . - Hey , Harper . So , I was thinking maybe we could do lunch today ? You in ? - Totally . - I love your glasses . Thanks , Harper . That 's so sweet . See you later , Jane . Hi . What 's going on with you ? What ? - What do you mean , what ? - Hey , can I ask you a question ? Do you think I have an Audrey Hepburn quality ? A ... who ... what ? Jane ? Can I speak to you a minute , please ? Now . Uh-huh , I know . - I do n't know what to say . - Well , I just ... You need to be straight with me . Do you think you could get me an autograph ? I 'm such a huge fan . Anything for you , Miss Shaw . JANE : So , then he told them with a completely straight face , " I do n't need a parachute . "  So , anyway , at this point , Aiden thinks he 's just going to meet Leo . And he walks in and like a hundred people ... like super famous actor people , and they jump out and surprise him .  HARPER : You were there ? Well , not technically . Oh , Billy ! Uh , hang on just a second . Hey . Oh , you 've become quite the celebrity around here , huh ? Please , me ? Do n't you have work to get to ? Of course not . I took the day off . I canceled . For our movie night . Everyone is going . It 's gon na be super fun . Everyone ? Jane ! Oh , what time are you picking me up ? I 'm not . What ? Why ? ' Cause , I 'm going alone . What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about me going alone to the movie tonight . Why are you being this way , Billy ? I 'm not being any way . I just want you to have fun . With everyone . Billy ... I 'll be fine . I just want to be alone , okay ? Rita Shaw ?  What are you thinking , Ben ? Rita , hold on , I can explain .  I canceled you , man !   BILLY : Leave a message . I 'm just going to keep calling you . We ca n't not go together . We 've gone together every year since we were kids . Just call me back . ELI : Uh , changed my mind about what ? Oh . Eli ? Hey . What are you doing right now ? Hmm , nothing . Not anymore , you 're not . We are going to a party . Uh , is that right ? Yeah , Aiden just invited us . It 's , uh , VIP only , and he wants us there . You and me . Can you believe it ? That sounds great , but I ca n't . I mean , I 'd love to , I just ...  Right on cue . Hey , open your door . What is going on ? Your limo awaits . And I do n't want to go to this party alone , so ... You got anything fancy to wear ? I think I can whip something up . - You made it . - Hi . And you look spectacular . Thank you ... I assumed ... Yeah , it 's a new suit .  You look great . Thank you . I 'm sorry this is so last minute . No , I 'm glad you called . So am I . Listen , I 'm going to go get a drink . Can I , uh , get you something ? I 'm okay for now , thanks . - Do n't go anywhere . - I 'll be right here .   Are you ready for a romantic movie night and picnic under the stars ... ? As ready as I 'll ever be . I thought you were Rita ... Uh , Miss Shaw . Dude . I saw her in your T-shirt the other morning . I think I can handle hearing you call her Rita . I thought you and Jane left for the movie already ? - She 's not here ? - No . What 's going on ? I do n't know . She must 've left . That does n't make any sense . And why is that ? Because , Ben , I 'm a liability , okay ? I 'm the guy people move their purse away from now . It 's exactly how they used to look at my brother . But , you know , that 's just who I am now , and I have to get used to it . But Jane ? She 's starting to find her place in school . Her star is rising and mine ? Well , it 's crashing and burning . Sit down . - Oh , dude ... - Now . - Look , Ben , I think it 's better ... - Stop talking and listen . You have to get over this thing . I know your brother , okay ? You 've never been like him , you never will be . As far as everyone else is concerned , people make stupid assumptions , and it 's really up to you what you 're gon na do with that . I suggest , suck it up . Because you guys have been a team for as long as I can remember , and I 'm not gon na let you ruin that because you 're going through a tough time . You 've always been there for her . You need to let her be there for you . You need to think more global , youthful , you ca n't let Eli own the new market angle . If you do , you 're dead in the water here . I 'm confused , India . Are you here to help me or sabotage me ? I 'm trying to help . I do n't know why I want to help you , but I do . We 're in the same boat , you and me . Is that right ? You ca n't see it now , ' cause you 're too close . But it 's perfectly clear what Gray 's doing to you . And what might that be ? She 's turning her favor and her focus towards Eli . It 's already started . He wo n't last .  He 's her nephew . He 's not going anywhere . Whatever , all right ? I 'm not worried about some kid . Hmm . That 's exactly what I said about Jane . But as soon as she was Gray 's favorite there was no place for me . What happened to you , it was n't right . But it had nothing to do with Jane . And what happens with Gray , will happen because of me , if it happens at all . You do n't get it . We 're just interchangeable pieces in Gray 's climb to the top . You do n't want what happened to me to happen to you . Humiliated . Disgraced . I 've never felt so small . We walk into the back room at the Roosevelt . Now keep in mind , I still think I 'm just meeting with Leo , right ? When out of nowhere , all these people jump out and scream , " Surprise !.. And they were behind the curtains , and other places . Anyway , as I was saying ... - Having fun , huh ? - Not really . This night , it 's ... it 's a total mess . Sorry about that . Oh , no , that 's not what I meant . You were the only good part of it , Eli . It 's just ... I realized this whole celebrity friend thing it 's ... Yeah , it is n't real . No .  And I have a real friend . And I let him push me away because I was so swept up in all of this . I should really be somewhere else tonight . For him . Well , the night 's not over , you know . What 's stopping you ? Get out of here . I am sorry . I know ... Can we just not talk about the gorilla-gram anymore ? - Please ? - No . I mean , yes . We can not talk about it forever . Billy ! Uh , no , thanks , Miss Shaw , but I am looking for Jane , actually . Totally . You should do that . Go surprise her . She 's around here somewhere . Yeah . What ? She is . Say what you like , India , at the end of the day , you 're here to kill whatever we come up with , right ? I 'm not here for that , Jeremy . Then what are you here for ? I 'm here for Gray . I 'm going to ruin her . And I wo n't stop until she 's out on the street with Jane there beside her . India . I want them to crawl . Have you completely lost your marbles ? Listen to yourself . No . You listen . And listen very carefully . I 'm going to take down Gray and Jane . Once and for all . And you are going to help me do it . You were the one feeding Beau Braun our ideas this whole time . You are the reason I was fired . - India ... - And if you do n't help me take them out , I 'm going to take you down instead . We could run this place , Jeremy . You and I . All of this can be ours . No Jane . No Eli . No Gray . Just you and me . Complete control . Well ? What do you say ? Did you do that because you wanted to ? Or because Gray told you to keep me close ? Does it matter ? Not really . - Ben ... - Hold on .  Oh , my God , that is uncomfortable . Ben , we need to talk . All right . These last few weeks , I could n't ask for anybody more attentive . And I really , really appreciate it , but it 's a little too much . The flowers , the bear ... Renny . The giant ape-man in my office . Okay . I just think we need to slow things down a bit . That 's all . Look . I realize I might come on a little strong . But that 's just because I care about you and I want to make sure you know that . So , I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to slow things down . I do . I do n't . Then I 'm not sure where this leaves us . I think ... What ? I think we need to take a little break . Hey . Hey yourself . I thought that was you . You creature-featuring solo tonight ? I was . That is unless you 're down for some creature action . I do n't know about that . I usually prefer my solitude for this sort of thing .  Do n't stay on my account . It 's okay . I 'm in it for the Sour Patch Kids . Okay , It was n't prison . It was a juvenile detention center . Super scary . I mean , it 's not like it was a country club . No , I was n't allowed to leave . There were some bad guys . Were you one of them ? Depends on who you ask . Here . Take my hand . Okay . Now tell me what you observe . Just give me a fact . It can be any random fact you notice . This is weird . Okay , okay . Um ... your fingers are extremely cold . - What else ? - Hmm . You have unusually tiny knuckles .  Okay . Now make two statements about me . One based on what you observed , and the other just on instinct . You like to do cartwheels . And you 're nervous to be at a new school because you think no one can relate . So , how 'd I do ? - Beginner 's luck . - Oh , come on . Okay . Okay .  ? I 've got a secret ? I 've got a secret to tell ? I 'll never keep it ? It does n't hide here very well ? I 've got a treasure ? I 've got a treasure chest ? I 've got it buried here forever Hey . I thought you were n't coming . I changed my mind . Billy 's over there if you want to sit with him . Yeah , I did n't want to interrupt . Looks like he 's , uh , made a new friend . How are you two doing ? Fine , I guess . Just , uh , trying to get back to normal . Back to the way things used to be . And what about that whole " it 's you " thing ? You ask him what it meant ? Yeah . Did n't get the answer you wanted ? Honestly , I 'm not sure what answer I wanted . Maybe your timing 's just off ? Trust me . I know all about that . Wait , where 's Rita ? Long story . Know how you warned me not to come on too strong ? Lesson learned . You know how you warned me not to let the fame thing go to my head ? Lesson learned . ? I 'll never keep it ? It does n't hide here very well ? Another melody ? I 've got a treasure  ? I 've got a treasure chest ? Another story to tell ? Another secret dream ? I 've got it buried here forever ? Thrown into a wishing well ? In my head ? Tonight , tonight , tonight ? Tonight , tonight , tonight 
@@5225441 In the criminal justice system , sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous . In New York City , the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit . These are their stories .  With only 12 days left until New York 's mayoral election , the latestst polls show state senator Alejandro Munoz still holding on to his lead . The time has come to fix our broken schools . The time has come to provide affordable housing for the hard-working people of the city . The time has come !  For far too long , we 've been a tale of two cities , one rich and one poor . - Amen , brother ! - Amen ! While the elite have never flown higher , the rest of us struggle to climb out of the gutter . That 's right . Alex Munoz is the one candidate who can bring us all together , the one candidate who can turn that all around .  He will , at long last , be a voice for all people . Thank you so much . Absolutely . You got it . My husband never forgot where he came from . He was born in the Bronx ... - Boss , I got to bounce . - Do what you need to . - And he fought to re-open this center because he believes in our community . El viene del barrio . Where 's Eddie going ? We got New York one in an hour . - Personal business . - Now ? To understand the core values that are so important to him , I give you mi esposo , the father of my children , and the next mayor , Alejandro Munoz .  Thank you , Yelina . Now , wo n't she be a great first lady of the city of New York ? Do n't touch me ! Get away from me ! I 'll cut you ! I swear to God . Put it down . Put it down ! - No ! No ! No ! - Put it down ! - Get away from me ! Oh ! You 're breaking my arm ! - Step back , sir . - It 's okay , I 'm on the job . Easy . I 'm D.O.C ! I 'm on the job ! All right . Make it easy for everybody . Step back . Step back . Ma'am ! Ma'am ! Drop ' em now . Now ! Look at what he did to me ! He was trying to rape me . What are you talking about ? No , no , no , no . Central , we need an ambulance . Make that two . Lindsay , the neighbors said they heard screaming and called 911 . Thank God the police got there so fast . I do n't know how much longer I could have held him off . How did he get into your apartment ?  I let him in . He said he just ... Wanted to talk . So you know him ? You were in a relationship ? I was , um ... Trying to break it off .  There he is ! Mi hermano from Jerome Avenue . Still stylin ' . ? Que pasa , Rafael ? Oh , yeah ! You look great , Mr . mayor . Oh , no , not yet . I 'm going to need your vote . - Uh-huh , you do n't have to visit me for that . I was doing a presser in front of city hall . I figured we 'd grab a coffee . Well , I 'm already on my fourth cup , but I 'll get you something . You have bustelo ? Let me guess , Starbucks . - Can you get him a coffee ? - Sure . I know you 're busy , man . Can I talk to you about something ? Sure . Anything , Alex . It 's about Eddie . Eddie ? Eddie Garcia from the projects . He got into a stupid fight with a girl . She says he tried to rape her . Svu picked him up last night . So could we just knock this down to a discon ? I mean , I was going over there to do the right thing , you know ? Which was what ? Try to talk some sense into her .  Yeah . No , she ... she said that I got her pregnant and now I had to pay up , right ? And you were n't buying that . First place , I do n't know how it could be mine , ' cause I 'm ... I 'm good with the timing thing . And since marriage and , you know , I only screwed up one time , and we had my son . Can I get out of here ? I mean , I got to talk to his teacher this afternoon . I 'm catholic . If you were n't going to pay , why 'd we find 2 grand in your pocket ? Um ... I do n't think I should ... I do n't think I should say anything else . Counselor . I did n't see you come in . I did n't want to make it a state occasion . This , uh , this case seems a little below your radar , no ? I have ... an interest . Sidebar ? Sure . So Alex Munoz , the mayoral candidate , called you on this ? He is an old friend . We grew up together . - Oh , with Eddie . - Mm-hmm . Los tres muscateros de Jerome Avenue . The three musketeers of Jerome Avenue . Alex had the heart . I had the mouth , of course . Eddie had the muscle to protect us when we got into trouble . So you 've stayed in touch after all these years ? Mm , less and less . They stayed in the Bronx . And meanwhile , Eddie bounced around . He got a job at rikers . Well , I got to say , I 'm impressed that Alex Munoz has the time to watch out for a childhood friend . Well Eddie 's been volunteering for him . He 's been driving him around during the campaign . So is Alex watching out for Eddie , or watching out for Alex ? Both , I guess .  Eddie 's no genius , but he 's a good man . Since his wife flaked off three years ago , he 's been taking care of his mother and raising his boy on his own . And it does n't excuse an attempted rape . No one is saying that it should , liv . But , I mean , what if that 's not what it was ? And there 's benefit of the doubt . I 'd like to make sure Eddie gets it . I think Barba 's just asking us to turn it over and take a good look before we go full-on . And you said okay ?   I just saw you guys ten hours ago . Is something wrong ? No , Lindsay , it 's standard for us to just follow up and see how you 're doing .  ? You know , I do n't know if the officers told you last night , but you do n't need to preserve the crime scene . It , um , always kind of looks like this . Oh , well , I ... I did n't mean anything by it . No worries . You 're sweet . He is , right ? Yeah , until you get to know him , sure . Uh , would you mind putting out your cigarette ? It 's electronic . It 's just water vapor . Anyway , did n't I answer your questions last night ? Well , we 're just trying to get a better picture of the relationship . I 'm a foot model and a shoe designer . I only do retail between gigs . You know , these brands seem a little high-end for Eddie , no ? Well , he came in with his wife . And then he came back the next day on his own . His wife ? You sure it was his wife ? Of course I 'm sure . What do you think the fight was about ? I did n't want to be the girl on the side anymore . Well , the thing is , Lindsay , Eddie told us the fight was about you being pregnant , that you attacked him . That 's crazy .  I 'm not pregnant . Oh . Okay . Any idea why he would think that ? You know , if my cigarette bothers you , maybe I could just talk to him . Absolutely . Is there something you want to tell me ? I thought it over . I 'm not sure I want to press charges now . We both just got hot under the collar . All right , so last night , he was trying to rape you , but today it 's a misunderstanding ? Has someone asked you not to talk ? Why would you say that ? Lindsay told you Eddie came into the store with his wife ? No chance . He has n't seen her in three years . She 's partying in Miami ... Are you sure ? - ' Cause he still wears his ring . - I 'm sure . Eddie 's ... eh , he 's just catolico , loyal . So Lindsay saw the ring , tried to make up a story . Yeah , then she says that she 'd be more comfortable just talking to Amaro . Because she thinks she has a better chance of working the male partner ? So she 's lied to you , tried to manipulate you ... So did Eddie . I know Eddie 's story ... On Facebook after I started the charity . She said she was interested in school issues . And you believed that ?  I guess I was naive . So you had an affair with Lindsay ? I thought she was at the perfect intersection of hot and crazy . What went wrong ? I underestimated the crazy . She started demanding money , and when I would n't come across with enough , she said she 'd boil my bunny . Come again ? She stalked my kids outside their school , and then she sent e-mails about the affair to my wife and our board . My marriage ended . And I lost a big grant from the gates foundation . Did Lindsay know about the grant ? We put on a press release . And that 's when she started making demands . I guess it was always about the money with Lindsay , was n't it ? You got something on Lindsay ? So far , four men have filed orders of protection against her for harassment and extortion . Means she 's a freak . Okay , so she lied to us . She 's changed her story . She 's gone back and forth about pressing charges . Maybe Barba 's right ... Eddie deserves the benefit of the doubt . Unless we 're asking the wrong questions . Here he goes . Her other marks were worth the risk . The head of a foundation , a wealthy shoe designer , sports tv exec . Eddie works at rikers . So maybe she 's hitting bottom . Or maybe ... Maybe Eddie 's not who she was shaking down . Good news , bad news , counselor . Eddie was n't in a relationship with Lindsay , and he was n't trying to rape her . Get to the bad part . Well , we think she may have been in a relationship with Alex Munoz .O . Is to get her hooks into powerful , married men . Look , she 's a heat-seeking missile , and Eddie has no heat . Your friend Alex does . If you knew Yelina , you 'd know he 'd never step out on her . With all due respect , counselor , you may not be totally objective . - Nick ... - Look , if Eddie was sent to assault her or scare her ... I understand what you 're saying , and you 're wrong . But take the steps you would with any other investigation . No one 's interfering . Lindsay ? She left last night . She moved out ? More like ran out with four suitcases and a limo waiting outside . Do you know where she went ? No . She was in a hurry . I live underneath . An hour back and forth in high heels , packing . Tap , tap , tap , tap , tap , tap , tap . These are all her shoes . I lasted all of two days because I was talking to some girl .  You know how it is when you 're young . But it 's markets like these that make this city great . In fact , I met my wife at one of them . Crowd : Aw ! And that 's the best reason , is you get Yelina as your first lady . And she 's not only prettier than me , she 's smarter . Thank you . Thank you so much for your support , really . Aqui por todos ! Crowd : Munoz ! Munoz ! Munoz ! Munoz ! Alex Munoz , can we talk to you for a minute ? It concerns Eduardo Garcia . Crowd : Munoz ! Munoz ! Munoz ! - Honey , is everything okay ? - Oh , absolutely . I 'm just gon na talk to the fellas here about the police foundation event . I 'll see you by the van , okay ? Crowd : Munoz ! Munoz ! Munoz ! Munoz ! I got a meeting over at the archdiocese . We just have a few loose ends we need to tie up . Yeah , we 've been looking at Lindsay Anderson 's background . It does n't quite add up , the story of how she got involved with Eddie . Eddie 's got a broken heart , and he 's ... he 's not the best judge of character . She probably saw an easy mark . Well , that fits her pattern , but all the other men she went after were rich , and Eddie , no offense , es un muerto de hambre .  I do n't know what to tell you . Mr . Munoz , we have n't called the brass . We want to handle this discretely . Eddie 's close to you , so we have to ask . Is he covering for you ? What ? I 'm a happily married man . I never even met this woman . You sure about that ? On the grave of mi abuelita . We 're tracking her down . That 's the kind of person you 're dealing with , a person who makes accusations and then disappears . I guess that 's good news for Eddie . If you 'll excuse me . Senor Munoz ! Senor Munoz ! My man 's slick . He must be pretty sure we wo n't find her . That 's okay . I just did . Last night , I friended her on Facebook . Tell me she " poked " you . Well , she liked my photo . There , the latest post from 40,000 feet . " On my way to Israel to start my awesome new job . " Political consultant to the labor party in Tel Aviv . How does an unemployed shoe clerk wind up working for your client 's political campaign in the middle east ? It 's a shoe model , I believe . Her name 's come up in multiple investigations , namely for causing problems with powerful married men . Is this something I should call the D.A . About ? Because I 'm handling his campaign as well , you know ? Do you what you need to do . It 's not gon na look good , though , a spin doctor who ca n't control bad press about his own office . All right , look . Can we handle this quietly , Nick ? It 's a personal matter . Lindsay was involved with you ? With my right-hand man . It 's a disaster . He has a wife , you know , two beautiful children . We 're going to need to talk to him . I 'm afraid that 's impossible . I just reassigned him to an overseas campaign . Let me guess , in Tel Aviv . He was having an affair with Lindsay , so you send them both off to Israel ? It 's what I call a win-win . So the D.A . Wait , does Alex know about this ? Well , he should ; The aide who flew off with Lindsay , he was working on Alex 's campaign till yesterday . I 'm sorry . He leaves the country right before the election ? Either he thinks the race is in the bag , or ... Look , he 's helping Munoz out by making sure that Lindsay ca n't talk to us . Just hold on . Did you ask Alex if he was involved with this woman ? We did , and he gave a categorical denial . What about Eddie ? He 's been ducking us ever since his release . I can make a call . Actually , I was going to suggest going the other way . Have you thought about formally recusing yourself , counselor ? Believe me , I would like nothing more . But ? The D.A . Has asked me to stay on it . Given the optics , he wants to be kept in the loop . Oh , so you can keep Munoz in the loop ? You 're out of line , detective . - Am I ? - Guys , please . We 'd like to keep digging . Go ahead . But we 're ten days away from an election . If you 're gon na take aim at the frontrunner , make sure you do n't miss .   Aw , hey , there , buddy . Is your dad home ? Hey , go help abuela with the remote , all right ? We tried calling . We got a few more questions we need to ask you , Eddie . Yeah , D.A . ' s dropping the charges , right ? The assault charges , yeah . But this is about witness tampering . What are you talking about ? We 're talking about that 2 grand we found in your pocket . Man , I told you . It 's for Lindsay 's abortion . Look , mad respect , okay ? My lawyer said I do n't have to talk to you anymore . Your lawyer ? You mean Alex ? I 'm going to make dinner for my family . ? Guapo ? I hope I 'm not interrupting . You ? Nunca .  Oh , it 's been too long . You look so great . You always tell me that . I 'm on my way to another rubber chicken dinner . Well , then , they 're very lucky . -  - All right . Sientate , por favor . What 's up ? You tell me . Detectives came by an event today to talk to Alex . Did Alex send you to find out more ? No , he gave me some excuse . He does n't even know I 'm here . Right , then ... Let 's not have this conversation . Rafael , you 're Alex 's oldest friend . My husband did n't marry a fool . I mean , Alex is on the verge of doing something really great for all of us . Papi , do n't ruin his chances . Look , if he 's got nothing to hide , he 's got nothing to worry about . So it 's like that ? Hmm . Just tell me one thing . Is this in any way ... About us ? All right , where 's the fire ? There 's something that we need you to see . Since Lindsay found her other chumps through social media , we figured she might have done the same with Munoz . So I went online , and I set up a " I heart Alex Munoz for mayor " page . He messaged me back within half an hour . " When you talked about the pension system , I got so excited " ? You set up a honey trap ? - Mm-hmm . - Scroll down . - Okay . " - He wanted to meet ? - Well , not exactly . He asked her to switch to a less public site . Okay . A cheating site ? Alex has an account ? Well , no , not by name . But his alter ego does . " Enrique Trouble " ? I think that 's his porno name . Come on , you ... This ca n't be real . - Well , it 's a nice avi . - Moving on . Okay , he asked for a picture first , so I sent him this selfie . Thank you . Any response ? Not yet . This could all be a hoax . Yeah , but that 's why I went ahead and asked him for a photo , okay ? You 've seen me . Let me see you . Do n't hold your breath . He 's at a fundraiser with his wife and daughters right now ten days away from the election . He ca n't waste time . Does n't that look like a tuxedo shirt ? There 's no face . I mean , it could be anyone . Okay , well , wait . How about this ? Um , " is that all you got ? "  Oh , good lord .  Oh ! Okay ! That 's the full Munoz right there . - Oh , no ! - And this guy wants to be the next mayor of New York . My God , this is terrible . Someone 's setting me up . That 's why I wanted to give you a chance to get out in front of this . You ca n't believe I sent these . So someone else , uh , sent the pictures of your penis ? I 'm not even gon na ... I 'm not even gon na dignify that with an answer . Alejandro , por favor . I 'm speaking to you as a friend , not a prosecutor . I ... I 've been hacked ... No , no , I 'll put my team on it . Rafael , how can you believe this ? It 's obviously wall street trying to keep me out of city hall . Alex , you need to be honest with me and honest with yourself . You came to me to ask for help on Eddie 's behalf . Because he 's my friend ... And your friend . You did n't ask our friend to go to Lindsay and hush her up about ... Enough . I do n't have time for this . It looks bad . To who ? To you ? Hmm ? You get to judge me ? You my priest ? You gon na tell me how many hail Marys I need to say ? Alex , I am going so way out on a limb for you . I could lose my job simply for speaking to you . Please tell me that there are no other women out there . Yelina is the only one . So now not only is he tampering with witnesses , he has you covering it up for him . Guys , please . Did you find any evidence at all that Lindsay is shaking him down or that he 's paying to hush her up ? There 's nothing so far on the public sites , - but we 'll keep checking . - Do that . You know , counselor , hold up . What ? Look , her Facebook page is scrubbed clean . We can get a warrant , have taru go through all his accounts . They might find something . A warrant for suspicion of sexting ?  That 's not going to happen . Speaking of texts , our D.A . Wants to be briefed . This should be short , but not sweet . You know , what you did , tipping off Munoz , you could be charged for obstruction yourself . We sit on all this till after the election , it 'll look like we were carrying the water for him too . And if we take him out now based on innuendo , it 'll look like a political hit . Are we done ? You driving me to the d.A 's office , detective ? Thank you . I am not cutting Munoz a break just because he 's my friend . No , I get that . It 's not about friendship . It 's about you . You 're afraid to go after Munoz , because while he stayed in the hood , in el barrio , and played man of the people , you went off to Harvard and pretended you were one of the gringuitos . - I know where I come from . - Yeah , so does Munoz , and he 's playing you , mi socio , and making you feel like a sellout .  Thank you so much for the ... Bodega psychoanalysis , detective . Compay . I 'm sure he said the same about you . What , everyone thinks we should just let this go ? Come on , Munoz sends out some selfies . That 's not a sex crime . All I know is I do n't want to see any more of them . It 's not just selfies , all right ? This clown could be mayor . He opened himself up to blackmail , right ? Eddie had cash . Where did he get it from , huh ? This could just be the tip of the iceberg . I think we saw more than just the tip . Even if you 're right , this is a political corruption case . We 'd have to hand it over to the feds anyway . What are we going to hand over ? The pics he sent to rollins ? It looks like I 'm not the only one . Enrique Trouble 's popping up on other sites . It goes back over a year . Except one of these women that he was sexting with just got an executive position at the New York gaming commission . I wonder who could have pulled those strings . Anna pretard . She have any governmental background ? - Does n't seem like it . - Hold up . I 've seen this girl on a screen before , and it was n't on c-span . I do n't understand this . I already have the position . We have a few background questions . Yeah , like your resume says you went to university of Michigan , but they do n't have any record of you attending . - They do n't ? - Mm-mm . I should fix that . I was more like auditing . Really ? What subjects ? Dance and movement . No acting ?  No . I never studied any acting . That 's funny , Amber , because my partner here says you 're a real natural in ... What is it , fin ? This is my favorite . Million dollar a night baby . Are you from vice ? I did n't do anything illegal . No , we want to know how you got your job here . Did Enrique Trouble put in a call for you ? So what if he did ? It 's Albany . Believe me , there are people a lot less qualified than I am working here . So , Alex , a.k.a . Enrique Trouble , used his position to get a former porn star a patronage job in Albany ? They started off just sending each other junk shots . Then six months later , she started texting him about her kid and how she was having problems making ends meet . And he helped her out ? Well , not until she told him she got a call from a reporter wanting to collaborate on a book . Then Alex started paying her off $500 a month , until he got into the mayor 's race . Then he came up with the state job . He had a bag man deliver the cash every time . And I know the bag man , do n't I ?  Hey , Raffi . What 's good , hermano ? How you find me here ? I stopped by your place , saw your mom . My mom looks good . Yeah . Yeah , she does , Eddie .  Bueno , we got to talk . You know , they ... They fixed this park since we were kids , right ? Yeah , they did . I remember how you always used to look out for me here . When that gang from p.S . 109 would come after me for my lunch money ... You 'd put your arm around me . You 'd walk me to school . You said anybody that hurt me would have to deal with you . You 're my brother , Raffi . I would never have learned English if it was n't for you . We 're even , right ? I know that . You 're loyal ... To a fault ... Bribery . Eddie , those are felonies . I ca n't ... I ca n't roll on Alex . You have got ... You have got to think about yourself now . Jail 's gon na go hard for an ex C.O . Raffi , Alex has always been good to me , okay ? He said when he becomes mayor , he 's going to get me a job at one p.P . Listen to me . Eddie , Alex is looking out for himself now . You 've got your son and your mother to think about . You 're not gon na be any good to them upstate . I ca n't hurt Alex . You tell me what I should do . You were always the smart one . *** to deliver envelopes to Anna and Jenny . And Lindsay ? Oh , that was a one-time payment . Alex said it was all legal and that we had to do it for the people of New York . Gaming , and she was state tourism . Good luck getting them to testify . We done here ? Eddie ? Look , Eddie , we gave you queen for a day . But if you have anything else to say , now 's the time . Okay , look , my client 's cooperated fully . Okay , but like Mr . Barba told you , if we find out you held something back , deal 's off . You can go to prison .  There was another lady . I did n't ... I did n't handle her . Why not ? I do n't know . Maybe because she was from yonkers . I ... I overheard Alex talking to his brother-in-law , Bobby , about making a run . Do you know the woman 's name ? Jodie . Jodie something . Um , French name . I think she was a schoolteacher .  Jodie Lanier . Yeah ? N.Y.P.D . We need a word . - No ? Then why is he giving you money ? Okay . I know who he is , but I 've never met him . Not in person ? How about on social media ? I mean , you 've exchanged messages . I ca n't talk to you about this . ' Cause that 's why he 's paying you ? Look , Jodie , you 're not in any trouble here . Then can I go ? Soon . But we need to take a look at your cell phone . No way . I have rights ! Do n't I ? We can get a warrant , but we 'll have to talk to your mom . Please do n't call my mom .  Captain , how are you ? Good seeing you ! Michael , how 's the little one ? Good seeing you . We got the cover of the New York magazine . Oh , good job . Good job . Hey , Joe . Hey , pleasure seeing you again . We need to talk privately . Now ? Seriously ? There 's a room full of union leaders and CEOs waiting to hear how he 's going to save the city . And I 've never been more serious . - Well , I 'll come with . - You can stay right there . Rafael , ? todo bien ? Alex and I need to talk . ? Ahora ? Well , let 's get a nice shot . Mrs . Slater , will you join us ? Big smile for the camera , Yelina . Big smile . I wo n't be long . - Shall we ? - Yes . Whatever you have to show me , Rafael , it wo n't alter anything , except our friendship . Do you recognize these women ? Stripper . Porn star . You helped them get on the state payroll . My office helps a lot of people . I guess it 's trickier when they 're too young to take the job , like Jodie Lanier . She 's a high school sophomore . We have n't . She friended the campaign on Facebook and wanted to volunteer . We 've never even been in the same room . You exchanged direct messages . Which I 've done with hundreds of other constituents . She 's not a constituent . And she 's 15 , Alex ! I had no way of knowing that . Really , not after the pictures she sent you ? The pictures that you asked for , by the way . And these , these are the ... What ? The pg ones . Those other ones that she sent ... You solicited and exchanged naked photos with a 15-year-old girl . This puts you in possession of child pornography . Where did you get those ? Eddie ? Eddie ? You used him as the bag man for everyone else , except for the 15-year-old , because you knew that would upset him . You son of a bitch . Right , okay , so ...  Here we are , Alejandro . I have to turn these over to a special prosecutor immediately . If you suspend the campaign , it might go easier for you . They got my oldest friend to be the hatchet man . How much are they paying you to take me down ? There 's no vendetta here ... Six days before the election ? The people will know better . I risked everything that I had to give you fair warning , Alex , and you know that . Here 's what I know , Rafael . Ever since you got that Ivy league scholarship , you 've been hooked on their teat . You think you 're one of them because you go on their ski vacations and their yachts ? The man snaps his finger , and you jump up and bite for him . It 's not about me , and you damn well know it . And if I go down , that leaves you . Let me tell you something . You take me down , the people will hold it against you . You wo n't be able to show your face in a barrio , and your political future will be over . Are you threatening me , Alex ? I 'm looking out for you , Raffi . Just like the old days . - No comment ! - New yorkers are smart . They know the powers that be are terrified of me becoming mayor . Is it true that you were sexting with a 15-year-old ? We 're not taking any questions at this time . The wealthy on park Avenue with their nannies and cooks , the real-estate moguls , the white collar criminals on wall street , the powers that be that benefit from the status quo , they know that I 'm gon na fight . But I 'm going to fight for the working people ... Too far to allow them to get away with this ! What about the explicit photos you sent ? I have been set up by powerful special interests who have used a corrupt N.Y.P.D . Detective , who 's been the subject of two I.A.B . Investigations , including prostitution , and my old friend , A.D.A . Rafael Barba , who has proven that he is the lapdog of this city 's aristocracy . Anthony , do me a favor ? Mute this , will you ? - Sure . - We 're not going to allow them to derail our agenda ... You know , I 'm not gon na apologize , but I have to give it to you , counselor . He still thinks he has a shot . Alex ... He 's a brawler . I gave him a chance to go quietly . But he would n't take it . Well , I will . Good night , you two . Anthony . Good night , Nick . Do n't count him out . He 's a winner . ' He 'll be mayor of New York someday . " Wow . She never said that about me . You okay ? It 's politics . No danger of a traffic jam on the high road . Still he was your friend . So was Yelina . She thinks this was personal , not professional . You had a job to do . You did it . That 's all this was . Was it ? - Mr . Barba , a word . - Reverend . Your office is destroying the reputation of a man who can turn this city around . Reverend , I am not directly involved with this case , but trust me when I say that this was not an easy decision . Alex Munoz is my oldest friend . Never mind all that . This city 's poor have been ignored for the last 20 years . We 're requesting that Mr . Munoz be released on his own recognizance . Your honor , the timing of this prosecution is politically motivated . Mr . Munoz is five days away from becoming the next mayor - of New York City . - Save the speech , Mr . Koob . Bail is set at $ 10.000 . Moving on . 
@@5225841 lncreased intellectual activity . Stress level 's rising . - What 's the problem ? - I ca n't be certain yet . Give me audio contact . Pull the trigger , Alpha . Pull the trigger now . That 's a direct order . I -- Damn it . All right , close it down . This is Dr . Rossick . The training exercise is now terminated . Will that be all , Dr . Rossick ? Yeah , Frank . Thanks a lot . What happened ? Well , I think she was confused by the moral decision she was forced to make . " Moral decision " ? What the hell are you talking about ? Alpha can make choices . Sometimes they bewilder her . I do n't want her to make choices . I want her to take orders and kill who I tell her to kill . You see , that 's just the point . You asked her to commit murder . Rossick , she is supposed to be the ultimate covert assassin . This project cost $30 million , and you 're telling me it does n't work . We 'll be operational by the end of the week . You had better be . All right , everybody , just leave her in the lab and you can go . We 'll start over in the morning . - Good night , doctor . - Good night . Ernest , I 've forgotten my briefcase . I 'll be right back . Alpha ? What are you doing out here ? This is Dr . Rossick . We 've got a level-four emergency . Alpha One has just escaped . She may be armed . And she is definitely dangerous . - Apocalypse Wow ? - lt 's a new club that just opened up . Sabrina 's throwing a charity bash there . It 's gon na be wild . - You got ta come . - I do n't know . It does n't sound like my kind of place , you know ? - Ca n't I just make a donation ? - No . - I have n't even got a date . - lt 's no problem . - What , are you my social director now ? - Hey , somebody 's got ta do it . - Well , we can stop by for a few minutes . - Great . Do me a favor , though . Try and dress a little hip , all right ? It 's party time . Barry , you look like an undertaker . Thank you . Listen , Tina , I 'm sure you 're just as excited about this evening as I am so we 'll just stay long enough to make Julio and Sabrina happy ... - ... then sneak out the back , all right ? - You 're gon na hate me ... - ... but I ca n't come . - What ? I 'm sorry , but my experiment 's gone wrong . - So you 'll do it again tomorrow . - No , Barry , I ca n't . No , I am not gon na leap into disco inferno alone . Barry , I ca n't .m . in the morning . Believe me , I 'd rather come out with you than work all night . Yeah , right . What are all these old research papers doing out ? I 'm leaving now . is there anything else you need ? Oh , no , thank you . Oh , Alpha , this is Barry Allen , a friend of mine . Barry , this is Alpha Webster . She just started as our new lab assistant . Alpha , that 's an unusual name . They call me Alpha because I was the first . - The first child in your family . - ln a way . Do you know what these are doing out ? I 'm sorry , I was trying to organize your files . That 's okay , I have my own filing system , thank you . I 'll see you tomorrow , then . - Good night . - Bye . Do n't you think you should be going ? It 's nearly 8:00 . Wait . - Why not ? - She 's very bright but a bit damp in the personality department . All business . I know you 're gon na meet a lot of beautiful young women there . No one with less than 1 2 earrings or more than a monosyllable . Well , here 's mine for the evening : - Out ! - All right . Really , it 's greatly appreciated . We wo n't forget it . Thank you . Sorry . Come on , man . Thank you . Thank you . Barry ! Hey , do n't you know that black is out as a fashion statement ? Have n't you heard ? It 's back in , man . Yeah , very , very in . - Where 's Tina ? - She could n't make it . Introduce yourself to the bartender . Tell him you 're a friend of mine . He 'll point out all the available chicks . - Money for the homeless . We 'll let her get around the corner before closing in . We do n't wan na cause a scene . Where 'd she go ? She go inside ? - Sorry . - Hey . Alpha , right ? - And you 're Barry Allen . - You have a good memory . Listen , why do n't we go try to grab a seat , huh ? - All right . - All right . Excuse me . What do you think the odds are of us running into each other tonight ? Two million seven hundred and eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty to one based on the most recent population of Central City . Wow , you really do have a memory . I 've memorized the Encyclopaedia Britannica , Webster 's Dictionary the complete works of William Shakespeare and 61 3 other books . - You 're not serious . - Yes . Where I used to live , after everyone left , I 'd stay up all night and read books . lt 's such a waste of time . Oh , here . Quick , grab these . There we go . One night I read a book about the Civil War . Did you know that Abraham Lincoln freed all the slaves ? - Well , I heard a rumor . - That 's when I realized I did n't want anyone telling me what to do or locking me up . I wanted to make my own choices . I mean , if people can be free , why ca n't I ? - Right . - lt 's all for a good cause , folks . So dig deep . Remember , the more it hurts , the more it helps . Thank you , sir . Very kind . Oh , very generous of you . Thank you . Help the homeless . Thank you , sir . Oh , thank you , sir . - Thank you , sir . - Would you excuse me ? - I see an old friend . - Thank you very much . Hey , Allen . Sharp threads . Did n't anybody tell you that black is out ? - You care to make a little donation ? - To whom ? The old hustlers ' home ? Excuse me , miss . Would you make sure the committee chairman gets this ? Thank you . Give me one good reason why I should n't run you in . - Hello . - Hello . Look , Barry , you let me go , and I 'll owe you one . A big one . You know my marker 's as good as gold . All right , but this is the last time , okay ? - Next time I have to book you . - You wo n't regret it . Anytime you need anything , give me a call . The same thing goes for you , honey . Any friend of Barry 's is a friend of mine . Ciao . What are they doing ? I have no idea . Well , actually I 'm no good at -- - I like this . - Where did you learn to do that ? - Are you a professional dancer ? - I 've never danced before . What ? Help for the homeless ? What , are you kidding ? Come on . There she is . Let 's go . Move ! Go ! Move ! Out of the way . Alpha ! - Are you in trouble ? - lt 's just that -- - All right . Time to come home . - What 's going on here ? Stay out of this . It 's none of your business . - Hey , buddy . I happen to be a cop . - You want to stay healthy ? Back off . - Do n't make this difficult . - I do n't want to go . It 's not up to you . Come on ! Hey ! Do n't shoot ! - Who are you ? - I 'm not telling you squat . " National Scientific Intelligence Agency . You better cut me loose right now . I do n't think so . We can get her address from her application but if the NSlA 's involved , she 's in serious trouble . - Who are they ? - They 're a top-secret government -- Someone 's jimmied the security system . Barry , what is that ? Come out , Alpha . - You 've been shot . - I 'm all right . What are you ? This is incredible . A synthetic humanoid with artificial intelligence . Who created you ? I was built as part of a secret project by the NSlA . My name is n't Alpha Webster . It 's Alpha One : Artificial Lifelike Prototype Humanoid Android One . I got the name Webster from the dictionary . What are you doing here ? I ran away . The purpose of the project was to create robot intelligence agents . Androids that could be programmed to kill particular targets . I wanted to be free . So those people who are after you -- Want to take me back and reprogram me . Why did you come to Star Labs ? Why apply for a job here ? Part of me was designed by you , Dr . McGee . - That 's impossible . - Three years ago , you worked with Dr . Jason Rossick on a robotics project for the government . That 's right . The idea was to build robotic limbs for handicapped people . There were problems , and I left the project . Last year , Dr . Rossick went to work for the NSlA . He 's the one that designed and built me . - Alpha , may I take an x-ray of you ? - Of course . I 'd like to see what they 've done to my work . Okay , just lie on the scanning table so I can record your image . McGee 's research . What circuits ? Someone 's at the main entrance . - Yes ? - Dr . McGee . Colonel Powers , NSlA . I have a federal warrant to search the premises . - Powers ? What do you want ? - This is a matter of national security . Either you open this door , or we break it down . Wait a minute . I 'm working on an experiment with toxic chemicals . I have to make sure the lab 's not contaminated . You 've got 1 0 seconds . What has Christine Powers got to do with this ? She 's in charge of the project that developed me . - Do you know her ? - Unfortunately . She was the NSlA coordinator on a project I worked on with Jason Rossick . She 's ruthless , cold and dangerous . She 's the reason I left the robotics project . She wants to take me back and erase my memory circuits . You 've got ta let them in . - They have a federal warrant . - Hide in the storage room . Let 's go . Search the building . Well , well , Dr . McGee . It 's been a while . Not long enough , Powers . - What 's back there ? - A storage room . - I 'll check it out . - I demand to know what this is all about ! We 're looking for a woman named Alpha . We know she just started working here . We also know you were with her earlier this evening . You were seen dancing together in a club . As far as I know , dancing 's no threat to national security . If you know where she is , you 'd better tell me now . - We ca n't help you . - What 's your interest in her anyway ? - We want to talk to her . - I remember how you talk to people . There 's nobody back there . I 've got a word of advice for you , McGee : - Stay away from me on this one . - lt 's clear back there too . Let 's move out . She 's gone . Must 've climbed out a window . Barry , whoever or whatever she is , she needs our help . I know . I 'll search the streets . Hey , hey , check it out . Hey , old man . Okay . Out kind of late , ai n't you , grandpa ? Look , fellas , I just want -- Now give me your wallet , and maybe I wo n't slice you up like a loaf of bread ! I do n't have any money . - Too bad . - Let him go . Look at this . I think I 'm in love . - I do n't wan na fight you . - Who said anything about fighting ? Come on , honey . Thanks . Cops . This used to be a nice neighborhood . Man , those punks really clipped me good . I 'm sure glad you came along , kid . - What are these ? - Cards . You know , poker , blackjack , like that . Where you from , the center of the Earth ? Cards . You ever hear of three-card monte ? You got any money ? Figures . Okay , look . That 's the queen of hearts . Watch . Find the queen . Beginner 's luck . Let 's try again . Okay . - How 'd you do that ? - My optical circuits are equipped ... - ... with x-ray vision . - Yeah , right . Look , kid , if you got x-ray eyes what color undershorts am I wearing ? Red . Look , I got ta go out for a little while . You make yourself at home , okay ? And do n't go anyplace . I 've been all over the city . I ca n't find a sign of her . Electronically , biomechanically , she 's a miracle . Except for this . - What is it ? - lt 's a ball of plastic explosive ... - ... in the middle of her memory circuits . - A bomb . - What 's it doing there ? - I think it 's a self-destruct device . If anything goes wrong , she could be destroyed . She was here trying to find a way to disconnect it . If Powers thinks she 'll lose Alpha , she may press the button . A bomb like this could kill a lot of people , Barry . Tina McGee . - lt 's for you . - Me ? - Hello . - lt 's Fosnight . - I been calling all over trying to find you . - What 's so important ? I told you I owed you one . You know that skirt you were with at the club ? Yeah , I ca n't find her anywhere . Yeah , well , she 's with me . I 'll meet you out front . I 'm on my way . We 've got a location . I need an ETA on Omega 's arrival . Sergeant Powers , Dr . Rossick and Omega left about 1 5 minutes ago . They should be in Central City within the hour . Good . - You made good time . - Where is she ? Down here . Alpha , Tina and I want to help . - We know about the bomb inside you . - Bomb ? Did I hear " bomb " ? - That 's why you came to Star Labs , right ? - Yes . You were trying to disconnect it . But it 's wired directly into my memory circuits . And if the bomb 's not removed properly , it 'll detonate . Excuse me . Detonate ? Allen , what the hell 's going on here ? Fosnight , Alpha 's not exactly what she seems . - She 's a robot . - A robot ? Yeah . That 's the idea . Listen , come back to Star Labs with me , all right ? I know I 'm human but trust me . - All right . - Okay . - Thanks , Fosnight . - Yeah , sure . No , it 's ... . You humans are very strange creatures . The more I learn from you , the more you puzzle me . - ln what way ? - You have the greatest gift the universe has to offer , life , and yet all you seem to do is complain and argue and fight with each other . Barry ! It paralyzes the nervous system . Do n't make us hurt you , Alpha . We just wan na reconstruct some of your circuits . Take me back and make me a machine ? - You are a machine . - No . - I 'm alive . I 'm a woman , just like you . - I hardly think so , Alpha . Rossick . - I 'm not going with you . - Listen to me , Alpha . You 're expensive equipment . We 'd rather have you back in one piece . But if you walk away from me , I will push this button and you will be nothing more than a handful of nuts and bolts . Run ! Stop her ! Let 's get him inside for questioning . The residual effects of the paralysis should wear off in about an hour . - Did you find Alpha ? - No , but Omega 's here . Good . Let me introduce the next generation in our android series : Omega . Faster , stronger , smarter . And he lacks the annoying habit of making his own decisions . Powers , I protest . Omega is n't ready to be field-tested yet . Yes , well , you 're not running this project , Dr . Rossick . I am . I 'm always fascinated at how pliable and fragile the human psyche is . - What 's wrong ? - I do n't know . lt 's some kind of a seizure . - His heart 's racing like a train . - Look , help me lift him up . We ca n't have him dying till he tells us what we need to know . Hurry . This should help you burn the drug out of your system . Thanks . Now I 've got ta find Alpha before Powers and her men do . Well , if another android can track her , she must have a signal we can lock on to . The problem is how to isolate it . Fosnight , I 'm glad you 're here . I needed to borrow your tools to make an adjustment in my optical circuit . Oh , my God ! Allen was on the square . You are a damn machine . Please do n't be frightened . I 'm not . lt 's just so ... . Hey , say no more . Anybody being chased by the feds is okay in my book . Look , you got ta get out of town , kid , and fast . - You got a car ? - No . - And no money either , right ? - No . All right , we got ta figure out a way to get you some cash real quick . I got it . You know that trick where you see through the cards ? - Could you do that again ? - Of course . My emergency fund . You pulled me out of a real jam , so I figure I owe you . - I do n't understand . - You will . You ever hear of something called poker ? Let me tell you all about it . Cards . Remember these ? There 's 52 of them in a deck . There 's four suits : Clubs , diamonds , hearts and spades . I got ta talk to Joey C . I 'm sorry to interrupt , but you got an empty chair at the table ? Come on . You 're a little out of your tax bracket , Fosnight . Deal them . Actually , it 's a friend who wants to play . Well , as long as he 's got you for a reference . Vernon , are the cards stuck together ? Her name is Alpha . A very wise man once said that poker should not be played with women in the house . - Vernon , are your fingers busted , or what ? - Get modern , Joey . Or you afraid maybe she 'll flatten your wallet ? Hey , I do n't mind taking money from a broad . Sit down , sweetheart . Gold 's 1 00 , blue 's 500 , green 's a grand . How many you want ? - That 's all you got ? - That 's all she 'll need . Deal the lady in , Vernon . Where is she ? - Hotel lnfantino . I 'm on my way . - Barry , wait ! I 'm getting another signal . identical to Alpha 's . It 's Omega . He 's closing in on her . Three nines . Just a minute . That 's the eighth hand in a row that you 've won . Do you know what the odds are against that ? If you give me the data , I can calculate them for you . - What ? - Relax , Joey . - lt 's a friendly game . - I 'm being friendly . I just wan na know how come she manages to win every hand . I can see through the cards . What ? You have two kings an ace , a jack and a four . She 's a good guesser . Come on , Joey , it 's just a little joke . It 's a gag , that 's all ! - Alpha , I 'm here to take you back . - I do n't wan na go . I 'm taking you back . No , you 're not . - Police ! Nobody move ! - Look ! It 's the Flash ! Come on ! Come on ! What the hell is going on here ? Okay . Let 's do this one more time . - You are not a human being ? - That 's right . I 'm an android . - A what ? - An android ? A synthetic human , like in all those stories by Isaac Asimov ? Yes . You read Asimov too ? - Oh , I love Asimov . - Bellows , do you mind ? - You 're a robot ? - Just like the one you found in the hotel . That was some kind of goofy mannequin without a head . - lt was a robot too ? - Yes . And I 'm the Tin Woodsman , and this is Munchkinland . - Lieutenant , she 's telling the truth . - Allen . What do you know about all this ? That she 's exactly what she told you , an android created by the government . She escaped because she does n't want to be used as a weapon . I think you better tell me the whole story . From the beginning . That wo n't be necessary . Lieutenant , I 'm Colonel Powers , NSlA . I have a federal warrant remanding this woman into my custody . I think you 'll find everything 's in order . You ca n't turn her over . They wan na reprogram her . There 's nothing I can do . It 's a federal warrant . - lt 's the same thing as murder . - Stay out of this , Allen . - All right , Alpha . - No , I wo n't go ! Alpha ! We know your destruct frequency . We have another transmitter . - You 're coming with us . You or your people so much as commit a traffic violation on the way out of my city , I 'll throw you in jail ! You understand ? It 's been a pleasure doing business with you , lieutenant . Come on . You should have seen her eyes when they were taking her away . It was like watching a person who knew she was going to die . Barry , we 've got to do something . Legally , Alpha may be government property , but I know she 's alive . She has feelings , emotions . They 're just gon na kill her . We ca n't just stand by . It 's not that easy , Tina . They 're holding her inside an NSlA facility . They 've got more security than Fort Knox . Even I ca n't get past it . Maybe you could with a little help . First , we have to isolate the decision-making circuits and then , disconnect them . They 've got an incredible security system : Electrified fences , mines , laser beams . You 're never gon na get through that . Then what do we do ? Maybe I can penetrate their security computer . The problem is in the decision-making circuits of the main memory core . What we have to do is eliminate them . And then we can reprogram the memory using the newer , updated Omega version . I 'm in ! Tina , you 're beautiful . It 's about time you noticed . Now let 's see if we can make them think they 're being invaded . This is Powers . What 's the problem ? Yeah , we 've got an intruder showing on the grid in Sector Four but according to security , there 's no one there . Check the system . Do n't worry . You wo n't feel a thing . How do you know what I feel ? - This is Powers . What 's the problem ? - Same problem , ma'am . - Get the damn thing fixed . First , we have to isolate the decision-making circuits and then , disconnect them . - This had better be good . - We 've got alarms going off all over . According to the computer , we 're being invaded ! Look , obviously there 's something faulty in your security system . I do n't wan na be disturbed anymore . Do you understand ? Shut it down . - They turned it off . - I knew you could do it . It 'll take them about three minutes to find they 've been penetrated . I 'll be back in two . All right . We 've isolated the decision-making circuit . Run the memory-erase program . - Hello . - Hello . Hey ! This is Powers . The Flash has penetrated the facility . I want you to reactivate all the security systems . I want him stopped . I 'm sorry , ma'am . They 've already made it through Gate Four . - What ? All of our research files . Somebody 's deleting them . Damn them . Powers ! No ! Powers , stop it ! Look ! If you destroy Alpha , you 'll kill everybody within 50 yards of her ! Yes , I know . - Oh , no . - Alpha , what 's wrong ? The self-destruct mechanism . It 's been triggered . There 'll be another signal in 30 seconds to detonate it . - God ! - I 've got ta get out of here ... - ... or you 'll both be killed . - Wait ! Tina , what 's the range of the destruct signal ? I 'm not sure . Ten miles , maybe more . - We 'll have to chance it . - Chance what ? Outrunning it . - The countdown 's been negated . - Yeah ? You outran the signal . I spoke to a friend of mine at Star Labs East . She found you a position in the Research Department . Do you think it 's wise to let Fosnight take Alpha to the airport ? - Sure , he 's grown very attached to her . - Yeah , that 's what worries me . Hey , Allen . McGee . - I got your plane ticket . You all set , kid ? - Yes . Thank you for everything you 've done . - You 've given me my life . - lt 's a pleasure . There are advantages to being an android , but sometimes I wish I was human . You ai n't the only one , stretch . Look , maybe we better get a move on . Fosnight , I think you 've made a mistake with my ticket . - What do you mean ? - My x-ray circuits can see it in your pocket , and it does n't say New York . Let me see that . Las Vegas . - Two tickets . - Hey , it 's just a little detour . Please do n't be too hard on him , Barry . He ca n't fight his nature . - Told you so . - Alpha , you 're a real piece of work . Thank you . I ca n't wait to meet next year 's model .

What do you need heroes for if the villain 's gone ? Well , he 's not exactly gone . Look . It 's a temporal anomaly . Brainiac made it by rewiring the circuits , then overloading them . - Where does it lead ? - lt could be anywhere . And any time . That means Brainiac could be changing the past . Or destroying the future . Is there a way of pulling him back ? This thing is too far beyond our own technology . Let 's go . Did n't you hear me ? I have no way of bringing you back . Let us worry about that . - This is crazy . - You asked for heroes . You did n't say anything about sanity . Well , we 're here . Wherever that is . And whenever . Over here . I think I know what Brainiac 's up to now . You thought I would n't catch you , did n't you ? He 's had trouble with kids coming onto his property at night , pulling pranks . - He means business . - You got that right , missy . Now , if y'all just move toward the house ... . It 's all right . You wo n't be harmed . And you wo n't remember . Clark Kent . You promised to get me some punch , remember ? Oh , sorry , Lana . I got sidetracked . - What 's this strange power you have ? - What do you mean ? The ability to attract every airhead in Smallville . Hey , Mr . Varsity ! Airheads are n't the only ones . You may have made All-State , Kent but I can burn your butt any day of the week . Oh , yeah , Kenny ? How about any night ? You mean now ? Okay , let 's do it . Clark , this is a dance . Kareem here says he can burn my butt . - Did more than that . - You had to show him how tough you are . - Guess I do n't know my own strength . Maybe you should learn . Hey , it 's not like I meant to hurt him . It 's just that I 've been going through some changes lately . Me too . Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? Stop ! There 's no reason ! Ah , but there will be , Kal-El . There will be . Kal-El ? I 'm not -- Just in time . Chameleon Boy . Cosmic Boy . Saturn Girl . Where are the other Legionnaires ? Hey , it 's only you . - You saw ? - Yeah , he touched his belt , then , poof . He 's built himself a spatial disrupter . Excuse me . It was something in the punch , right ? We should be safe here . For the moment . Would n't hurt to have a disguise . Hold still . - lt better . - Brainiac 's trying to alter our past . - And your future . He wants to kill you before you ever become Superman . " Super " who ? Superman ! You ! Red underpants ? Now I know you 're crazy . I realize all this is hard to take in , and maybe we do seem a little ... . Freaky ? But if you just open your mind . The thirtieth-century is an age of unparalleled peace and prosperity . But none of this would have been possible without you . Me ? Superman showed that beings from different worlds could work together for a greater good . This is the principle on which the Legion of Super-Heroes was founded . But Brainiac would tear all this apart . He 's a living computer who destroys whole planets . Superman stopped him , but after years of dormancy Brainiac managed to reassemble himself .

@@5226141 Earth . Fire . Air . Water . Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world . Ba Sing Se has fallen ! After Zaheer and the Red Lotus toppled the Earth Queen , the city descended into chaos . Meanwhile , Korra and Asami tried to escape their captors but crashed in the desert . After getting to safety , they met up with Lord Zuko , Tonraq , and Beifong . Back in Ba Sing Se , Zaheer freed Mako and Bolin , giving them a vital message to deliver to Korra . But will the brothers find her in time ? I ca n't believe it . The upper ring is in chaos . Do n't try to stop us . We 're taking back what 's ours . Stop you ? I 'm gon na join you . I know where the good stuff is . - Should we do something ? - This is n't our battle . We have to deliver Zaheer 's message to Korra immediately . Right . Okay . Find Korra , deliver message . Yeah , this should be easy .  This is n't gon na be easy . We need an airship . Ooh ! Excuse me , may I have your attention please ? I 'm with the Republic City police , and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar . Let me give it a shot . Hey , the Queen 's gold is on the third floor of the palace ! Second door on the right ! You just got ta know how to talk to them , bro . They took everything . I mean , who rips out a transmission radio ? Some folks just do not have respect for other people 's property . Now let 's steal this airship ! You know how to fly this thing ? Technically speaking ? No . But , come on , how hard can it be ?  Up ! Up ! I do n't see any " up " button . I see levers and switches . Mako , our family 's down there . - Move over . - Ahh ! We 're getting them out . Oh , you think just because you dated Asami , you know how to fly this better than me ? Yeah . Bolin ? What are you doing here ? I came to get you guys out . This whole block is about to go up in flames . Come on , Mako and I have an airship on the roof . We ca n't . Grandma wo n't go . This place is my whole world . I will not leave . Oh , but I 'm so glad my little Bolin has come back to visit . Sit down . Would you like some tea ? Grandma , we do n't have time for tea . - Mom , please . - No ! I ca n't abandon the place where I raised my family . It 's my home . I 'm not going . Fine ! You leave me no choice . We 're rolling out !  Wait . Okay , let 's go . Thanks for getting us out of there . I mean , I probably could have handled it myself if you guys did n't show up , but thanks .  May she rest in peace . This airship is nice . Is it our new home ? No , grandma , I 'm not sure where we 're gon na take you . But right now , we need to find Korra . Did something happen to the Avatar ? I 'm afraid so . Her airship went down somewhere in the desert . She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se . If we retrace her route back to the base , we should find the wreckage .  Guys , it 's the wreckage . I found it . There . See ? I told you . Landing is hard .  Spirits . Okay , guys , we think Korra found her way back here . Now let 's split off into teams and scour the town . Yes , we 'll need your help too , Pabu . Now just give me a second while I  Wait . Pabu ? Pabu !  Why is Bolin hugging that big rat ? Ew . Now he 's kissing it . Mwah , mwah , mwah , mwah . I 'm never gon na let you go again . Guys , look out ! Giant dogbeast thingy !  Okay , all right , Naga . It 's good to see you too . Ahh , stop . You 're licking my mouth .  Asami ! Korra ! You guys are okay ! Sorry , I was just it 's so good to see you . It 's really good to see you too , both of you . Good . You guys are n't dead . Oh , my gosh . It 's Lord Zuko . I ca n't believe it .  Uh , forgive my brother . We 're just really honored to meet you , Sir . It 's a pleasure to meet you as well . You must be the Avatar . Mako told me so much about you . You are even more beautiful than I imagined . Uh , actually , that 's Asami . This is Avatar Korra . Korra , this is my grandma , Yin . You are very muscular for a woman . Um , thanks . You too ? What lovely young women . Mako , why are n't you dating any nice girls like them ? Uh , so what happened to you two ? Where have you been ? We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se . We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown . What ? How did you escape ? Zaheer let us go . Why would he do that ? Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message . He said he 's gon na wipe out the new air nation and everyone in it , unless you turn yourself over to him . Zaheer 's threatening innocent lives , just to get to me . He could be bluffing . He 's already taken out the Earth Queen . I do n't think he bluffs . We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming . I agree . Unfortunately , we do n't have a radio on the airship . There 's a portable radio in the jeep , but the signal will never make it to the northern air temple . We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter . The metal clan will have one . Let 's go . We 'll radio Su on the way . Hopefully she can get ahold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu . Did you have any luck getting through to Tenzin ? No one 's answering . I hope so .  We have a strong signal , but no one 's answering . I ca n't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the northern air temple . - We have to do something . - I 'll ready my airship . With the full force of the metal clan security backing us , we can take them . We 'll never make it up there before Zaheer . There might be another way to stop him . It 's a long shot , but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World , and I know exactly where he goes : Xai Bau 's grove . If I could find him there , maybe I could somehow trap him . We ca n't protect you in there . I do n't like it . - I 'll be fine . I have to try . - I 'll watch over her as she meditates . Zaheer , come out ! Face me ! Leave the airbenders out of this . There you are . Please do n't hurt me , Korra . I 'm just an old man . Iroh ? What are you doing here ? I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection , but instead I found you .  In the Spirit World , you always seem to find something you did n't know you were looking for . You look troubled . - I am . - Sit . What is on your mind ? There 's a maniac on the loose , and he 's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation . I do n't know what to do . Just because you are the Avatar does n't mean you will have all the answers . I know many avatars have needed guidance , but I 'm the only one since Avatar Wan that ca n't get help from my past lives . I wish I could talk to Aang . - Yes , my nephew . Their relationship started off a little rocky , but they grew to become lifelong friends . Best friends . Thank you . Thank you so much . You 're right about the Spirit World . I came here looking for someone else , but I 'm glad I found you . - Did you find Zaheer ? - No , he was n't there . But there 's someone I need to talk to . You 're leaving ? Are n't you coming to the air temple with us ? I 'm sorry , but I ca n't . I 'm going back to the Fire Nation . If it 's true that the Red Lotus is targeting the nation 's leaders , I need to protect my daughter . I understand , you have to keep the Fire Lord safe . But before you leave , I was wondering if you could help me with something . I was often Aang 's council , and I 'd love to be yours . Hmm , rebuilding the Air Nation was Aang 's biggest dream . He would be beside himself with joy with what you 've done , and if he accomplished that goal , he might have sacrificed anything to protect it . So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation ? I do n't know for sure . The airbenders might have been closest to Aang 's heart , but as the Avatar , he was concerned with people of all nations . No one knew better than Aang that in times of turmoil the world needs its Avatar the most . Thanks . Your Uncle was right . It was helpful talking to you . Wait , you spoke with my Uncle ? Yes , in the Spirit World . A couple of times actually .  Guys , we got through to the air temple . Who is this ? I told you , it 's Bolin ! He 's outside with the bison . Did you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison ? No . A whole herd , really ?  Meelo , this is your commanding officer . Go get your dad , now . Yes , Sir . Come on . Come on . Hello , this is Tenzin . Tenzin , listen to me carefully . Zaheer is on his way to the temple . He 's coming for the airbenders . You have to get everyone out of there immediately . Drop everything . Leave now ! - Oh , no . - What ? What is it ? Tenzin ! Tenzin , what 's happening ? It 's too late . He 's here . What is it , daddy ? We need to get everyone out of here . Stay close to me . What 's going on , Tenzin ? It 's Zaheer . Round everyone up . We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately . Look out !  It 's Zaheer . We have to leave .  No one 's going anywhere , or she gets it . Good , the entire family is here . It 's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master . What is it you want from us ? Nothing at all . In fact , if everyone cooperates , you will all walk out of this situation unharmed . Then what are you doing here ? I want Korra , and I 'm tired of chasing her . - You 're using us as leverage ? - Yes . I will never let you get to Korra . Unfortunately , you do n't have a choice . Yes , I do .  Jinora , get everyone out of here . Bumi , Kya , help me hold them off . And stay out of her line of sight . Go . Go !   It 's too dangerous we 'll never make it to the stables with her up there .     No . - I ca n't wait any longer . - Wait , what are you doing ? Whatever I can . Get to the bison ! Get out of here ! Kai ! No .    I got you .   Bumi , let go . But we could die . We 're gon na die if we hang on .  Oof .    Give up . It 's over . As long as I 'm breathing , it 's not over .   Whoa ! Thanks , buddy . Yip yip .  ?

You said that 's what you wanted - I could have eaten a box of Alpha-bits and crapped a better interview - Well , what did you think ? - Honey , I begged you to say ' little star ' . - It was even worse than the last time - You made me hate TV - Want me to play it back for you , Raymond ? - All right , all right , all right Come on .

But ... - it could n't be all bad - Come on , dad , I made voice high and low , like you said - That did n't work - What about my little Steinbrenner  Knights of Prosperity Robbing from the rich to give to themselves.Knights of Prosperity ! We 're the Knights , baby ! Yeah ... You 're here by call the war to this official meeting of the Knights of Prosperity A point of business before we get started ? Go ahead Gourishankar . I would like to propose that next time when we go to rob Mick Jagger , instead of whool ski masks , we wear theses . My skin can breathe . You look as if Ringo Starr walked into a sliding door . ok , moving on . Tomorrow morning , 9am , Rockefeller will enter Mick Jagger 's appartement to start his new job , as the security gard Reginald Van Hoogstratten . Finally give us an opportunity to case the join from the inside . I did n't do it . ok . Not important , moving on . These is the three biggest I want you to keep an eye out for , ok ? One : What are the valuables , where they 're kept ? Two : Where are all the entrances and exits ? And three : What are the comings and goings of the guards , Mick and his houseboy Nath Pran ? Consider it done . I do not look like a thumb ! I did n't do it ! It 's Rockefeller . Ask him what it 's like in that . Hit me , brother Butts . Eugene , we 've got a fly in the ointment . What happened ? I did n't get assigned to Mick Jagger . What ? I got ta go . Have you lost your mind ? You 're gon na create a mob scene . But they told me you specifically requested that Screech be on the sign . My name is Dustin Diamond . Sorry , Mr . Diamond . It 's ok , call me Screech . Hey , check out this stuff I ordered from SkyMall . Not here . We 're too exposed . This sucks ! We work so hard to get him the job , he gets the job , and he 's not even assigned to Mick Jagger . It just ai n't right . What are we gon na do ? Let 's not get crazy and let 's think . what do we know ? First of all , Screech sounds like a crazy crackle like in mamma jamma . Not even close , sir . Forget about Screech . What did you learn about Burton Security ? They 've got different teams assigned to different celebrities . I 'm the floater , so they put me wherever they need me until a permanent job opens up . But that can takes months ! Years !.. Mick Jagger . " ok , do that . But I 've been here one day . Rockefeller is a gentleman who works in a Jewish supply warehouse . Certainly you 're familiar with the term " chutzpa " It 's not no sound right there . This about grabbing our destiny . Grabbing destiny . - That 's right , you can do this . - I can do this . - You can do this . - I can do this . - I 've got chutzpah ! - I 've got chutzpah ! - I 've got chutzpah ! - I 've got chutzpah ! Who the hell do you think you are ? ! You have some set of royal brass stones to come in here after one day and ask to be a permie ... Get out of here , Van Hoogstratten ! - Now ! - A'ight ... Frank Cortland 's office . What are you looking at , floater ? Sounds like you met the one and only Frank Cortland . Man , I 'd like to put that guy through a juicer We all would . Ralph Carnucci . Rockefell-Sorry , I ca n't get that damn song out of my head . Reginald Van Hoogstratten . I was a floater for three years . Sucks I once had to take Bed Millers Duckson to the Sundance Film Festival . Who are you assigned to now ? Mick Jagger . I work in his appartment ... Let 's go Carnucci ! ... with Mister Sunshine . See you around . What did I tell you Rockefeller ? Believe in yourself and magic happens . Eugene , the man chewed my ass off . Do you see under here ? No ass ! A small price to pay , because you delivered us the golden ticket to the chocolate factory and his name is Ralph Carnucci . How do we befriend Ralph Carnucci ? Karaoke night . We concentrate on the duets . You sing " Islands in the Stream " with the guy , and trust me , bounding happens . Okay ... Anyone else with any ideas ? Let 's take him to a strip club . Nothing makes a guy talking like booze and boobs . Gary , there is a lady present ... He 's right , these things work like truth serum . Look , I like the hanky yanky as much as the next guy , unless the next guy of course is Gary . But I do n't think that 's the proper setting to engaging casual conversation . Anyone else ? Anyone else ? How about go to a strip club ? I just rejected that ! I mean now , might help us think . I got it ... have laughs ... engaging casual conversation about his work and Squatch , Bim ! That 's brillant ! You once again hit us with your genius thing . That 's USA one , and India zero ! I 'll be at Flash Dancers . Right on , excellent , all right ! Ralph and Rockefeller are on their way up , okay ? So , before they get here ... Louis , get out the booze , all right ? That will help lubricate the information flow . And everybody remember , Rockefeller 's name is Reginald Van Hoogstratten , ok ? What about us ? Do n't we need fake names too ? Oh , good point . All right , I 'm Bernie . Madonna . Skipper . That is the stupidest name I 've ever heard ! Oh yeah ? What do you got ? Mike . Hey , yo ! Wait , guys , I still do n't have a fake name ! This is Ralph . How you doing ? Hey , Ralph , hi ! Hey , Bernie . And you are ? Eugene . It 's nice to meet you all . I got to meet Screetch at the comedy club . - Plate of a floater . - Hey , come on ! It 's tequila time ! Ralph , you ... you 're with me , buddy ? It 's like being on the streets of Tijuana ! ok , cowboys . The name of the game is " Seven card start " . Two 's , Three 's , Four 's , Five 's , Six 's - and Seven 's are wild ! - What is this ? Poker or Go fish ? ok , no wild cards . So , Reginald tells us you do a little security work for Mick Jagger . For a few years now . I always wondered ... Do those guys eat with real silverware , you know , like the real silver kind like actual real silver ? I really do n't eat with them . Of course not . Do n't be ridiculous , Bernie ... Sort of . There are expensive paintings on the walls ? We do n't really eat with the client , was what I meant . - But the silverware is real silver , right ? - Probably . I guess ... I really do n't know . - The room is spinning . - Go back to sleep , pirate ok . Hey , big guy . My set 's about 40 minutes , could get up to 45 , you know , giving the laugh spread . Once I 'm off-stage , you got ta get me out through the back of the kitchen , no stopping , if the crowd gets me , I 'll be yacking with them forever . Yes , Mr . Screech . Ladies and gentlemen , He 's screeched his way into your hearts on Saved by the Bell . Here he is ... Justin Diamond ! So a horse walks into a whore house , Three dollars . I did not swing out of a tree yesterday , my friend . I call . Three kings . Surprise , surprise ! Ralphy boy wins again . Listen , guys , I got ta be at work tomorrow at 6am . Those are your normal hours ? Normal hours ? My hours are whatever my hell of boss decides to make them . We 've all had our share of crappy bosses , huh ? Not like this dude . The only thing I like about this guy is that I know one day he will die . Is there a bathroom around here ? Yeah , right back that way . We 've got nothing from this cabr ? n ! And he took all our money ! Silly me , I thought if I robbed Mick Jagger , I would have more money , not less . We can turn this guy . - Say what ? - We should ask him to help us rob Mick . And how do we even approach this ? Do we wait for him to come out and ask him : " Hey , could you please pass those chips and help us rob Mick Jagger ? " I 'll do it alone , and I 'll do it gingerly . Like a cougar stalking its unsuspecting prey . If I feel that he 's not going forward , I 'll pull back , but if he does ... then-Toilet paper 's got menorahs on it . Felt a little weird . Oh , yeah , ban on that , chief . Hey , Ralph , have you seen the view of the city from here ? - No , did n't see it . - It 's unbelievable . You got ta check it out before you take off . All right , let 's go ! - Pretty good poker player . - Thanks . You too . You need to vibe your own and get burned . If you did right , you 're breaking into part all without a word . Very very true . I get a vibe off from you , Ralph . I do n't know exactly how to approach this . How do I say ? But I think you and me got some stuff in common . - And ... - It 's fun watching you squirm . I 'll make it easier on you . Let 's have diner friday night . - Where ? - Forget it . It ai n't happening . Come on , chief , this is the kind of break we 've been waiting for ! I 've only had one rule in my entire life that I 've lived by , it has always served me well . Never ... date anybody named Ralph . But it is just diner.One tiny little gay meal . Yeah , but what if he wants something more ? what'so big hold his hand a little . But he do n't believe you . He smile gently , put his hand upon your face , and say : " Come on , yo , let 's do this thing . " Suddenly , his lips on yours , and kissing you hard . And the crazy thing is you 're kissing him back . And it feels so strange and somehow familiar . Your heart start pounding . Your head get dizzy . The rest of the night go by in a fever dream . You wake up ... naked in the tangle of suede sheets skin to skin with another man . suit ? You say goodbye to the life you knew . ' Cause from now on , you 're living on the down-low . I 'm just playing with you , babe , you 'll be fine . Please , Eugene . You 're the only one that can convince Ralph to help us rob Mick Jagger . We need you . Screech wants chicken wings . Regular Audrey Hepburn . I am never gon na let you forget a single moment of this magical ... evening . Please , go away . Relax ! I 'm not here to push the boost ? I 'm here to talk strategy . ok ? Now , the name of the game tonight - is tease , tease . - How 's that ? How many times you 've been played by a hot chick ? She strings you along , you do whatever she wants , in the vain hope that someday , eventually , she 's gon na give up your am I right ? I guess . ok , well , tonight , my friend , for the very first time in your life , you 're the hot chick . So you tease , tease ... You make him think that the only way into those pants is by helping us rob Mick Jagger . Alright , Squatch , I 'll do what I can do . Good ! Now come here , put this on . How 's the frozen mousse like ? Acceptable . I 'm sorry I had to drag you all the way down to Connie Island . I mean the onions were awful . It does n't even have his own special dipping-sauce ketchup , please ... - Come on . - It 's a dump . I 'm sorry . I ca n't risk my boss seeing me with a man . I know this agent who came out of work , 2 weeks later they fired him for setting an office surprise . Meanwhile , my boss is banging the secretary the whole time , like that 's perfectly ok . Security business ... So freaking macho . You know , the janitor world 's the same . You know , it 's just like Top Gun with toilets . - You got a great sense of humor , Barney . - Thanks , Ralph . So ... So ... How about a stroll on the boardwalk ? - I do n't know , it 's getting kind of late , and ..... Alright . You like comedy , right , Van Hoogstratten ? You 're a ... comedy fan ? I guess so . You 've seen Saved by the bell , right ? - I 'm familiar with that program . - ok , be honest with me . What 's funnier , Saved by the bell or any of Woody Allen 's last five movies ? I 'm not talking Annie Hall or Sleeper either . Talking about his last five movies . The new one I 've seen is Match Point . And that was dramatical . Come on . True or false : Dustin Diamond is funnier than late-period Woody Allen . True ? Or false ? True . Eat a wing . Not that one . So , you ... feel like having a little Night Cap , back at my place ? I do n't think so . - Unless ... - What ? Nothing ... No , please . There was something I was meaning to ask you , but ... Yeah ? Well , it 's kind of a business opportunity . I do n't follow you . Have you ever considered in your life doing anything that was n't completely you know , a 100% legit ? What are talking about ? Some sort of Bonnie and Clyde action ? Not Bonnie and Clyde , Clyde and Clyde , you and me , buddy ! Are you serious ? I do n't know where you 're headed with this and frankly I do n't want to . I 'm a good catholic boy . I think if I stay out of trouble here on earth , when I get to the Pearly Gates , Jesus 'll let the whole gay thing slide . You got the wrong guy . Wait a second , Ralph ! Wait ! I thought you liked me . I 'm sorry . This is no good . I love you , Johnny Cakes . What ? You do n't watch the Sopranos ? I can not afford showtime . Look , I practically did it with the dude , - and what do we have to show for it ? Nothing ! We have ... this ! Oh , I love this , I love it . Sure feels good not to be the gayest guy in the room , for once . No , you 're still the gayest . Louis ! Go kiss Eugene ! So funny I forgot to laugh . Meanwhile ... our plan is down the poopster . - Not necessarily . - What are you thinking , Gourishankar ? You said Ralph 's boss had a guy fired for being a homosex , right ? We send these photos to Ralph 's boss . He get Ralph fired for being a homosex . That create an opening with Mick Jagger . They fill that opening with their only floater , Mr . Rockefeller Butt . But wait a second , we ca n't just out this guy . Why ca n't we out a homosex ? He 's the enemy ! Suddenly , all homosex , we must be friendly to ? That 's not the point . This particular homosex is one of us . Look , he 's like a working stiff , juste like us guys , you know ? And I got to know this guy , and I kinda like him , regardless of his private ... weener business . All right ? So we do n't do that , we do n't burn a guy like this , a nice guy , that 's ... That 's just not the Knights of Prosperity way . Are you with me , Louis ? I 'm sorry , what ? Wait a second ... Hold on a second , yeah ! Wait a minute , I got it . Yes , Eugene Gurkin 's brain has figured it out once again ! Ralph said his boss is cheating with his secretary . Squatch ? Get your camera . So last night , I 'm at the bar , I meet this girl , she 's like a cross between ... - Oh , yeah ? - Carnucci ? I want you to take his place . - Yes , sir . - Good . But that leaves us one short to Mick Jagger 's . Van Hoogstratten . See me in my office . What is it ? You ok ? I 'm in ! Congratulations ! Now , let 's go out the homosex . You know ... The tall guy , Ralph ? What ? He 's gay ! 
@@5226441     Home . Father ! Father ! Father ! Father ! Father ! Father , it 's me ! Come on , father ! You are never going to believe where I 've been ! Alice ... It all began with this white rabbit , - and he wanted to take my hat and then ... - Alice ? Is that really you ? Who else would I be ? You were gone a very long time . We ... we thought you were ... you thought I was what ? Dead .  White rabbits , smoking caterpillars ? Giant mushrooms ? Who does she think I am , a fool ? Why would she lie ?  Your child is delusional . She 's delusional . She 's making it up . But I can cure her of this . So she 's a liar . She is a liar . I 'm not a liar . It was real . And I 'm going to prove it .  You 're really gunning for that customer of the week plaque .  It 's a winwin , Ashley . You get my mug on the wall , - I finally get ... whoa ! - Sorry , brother . Closing time . It looks like a storm 's coming . You better find a place to keep dry .   I 'll get right on that .            There you are . Bloody hell ! What are you doing here ? I 'll tell you on the way . We 're late . No , I 'm not interested in your important dates , Rabbit , or your unimportant dates , for that matter . No , no , no , no . Who ? Alice . She needs help . You 're the Knave of hearts . She needs you .   Answer the question , please . Alice ? Alice ? I do n't remember . Oh , I think you do . It 's been a year now , and you 've been quite clear in your statements . An invisible cat , a hookah-smoking caterpillar , food and drink capable of altering your physical form , a murderous red queen . And you encountered all these things by literally ... falling down a rabbit hole . Hearing it out loud , it all sounds quite ... preposterous . Would n't you agree , Alice ? Yes . Good . Just a few more questions , and maybe this time , we can send you home . When your father finally brought you to us , he was at his wit 's end . It was n't just your multiple disappearances that had taken a toll . Do you still believe that to be true ?    Hey , that 's mine . Give it back .   Trespassers ! Halt ! She 's headed into the maze ! By order of the Queen , stop ! Do n't let her get away !   She 's headed for the Queen 's garden !  After her !  I thought she went this way ! She must n't get away !  Where 's the girl ? Has anyone seen her ?  I thought she went this way !   Alice ?  Alice ?   Alice ! No . It was n't true . I never left England . So you just ... And the lady ? She knows what really happened .   Search everywhere !   She has to be here somewhere . There 's nowhere left ! Do n't let her get by . Where did she go ?    What are you doing in my bottle ?  Turn me in , and I get big . Right here , right now , burst your house into a million shiny pieces . We would n't want that now , would we ? Good bottles are so hard to find these days .  My name is Cyrus . My home is your home .  When you finally resurfaced , you claimed to be in this ... Wonderland . Can you tell us where you really were ? With a friend . What place do you call home ? England . Although it has n't exactly felt like home lately . So we 're both strangers in this most strange land . " Strange " is one word for it . Wondrous ? Dangerous . I sense that you can take care of yourself .  And you have to go back to your land soon ? Well , I do have what I came for . Which is what ? Proof that all this is real .   Oh ! You want proof ? Come here . I 'll give you proof . Uhh ! A talking white rabbit in jacket and trousers ?  No one can say I imagined that . Yes . That much is certain . So tell me , Alice , who is this proof for ? You 've risked much to come back here . Is it ... a husband ? No . There 's no one like that . Good . Yes . That it would . The proof is for my father . He thinks I 'm insane . Really ? So you 're risking your life for someone who does n't believe in you ? You know ... When you really love someone , you do n't need proof . You can feel it . Maybe where you 're from , but in my land , I wish things would ... You wish things would what ? You found my bottle , Alice . Anything is possible . " Mistress mine , " " my will is thine . " " Tell me your wishes three . " Alice , if you wish to be released from this facility , - you need to ... - I do n't wish for anything ! Would ... this have something to do with the genie you believe you met ? You told your father that you ... you set him free , that the two of you traveled from world to world , fighting pirates , swimming with mermaids . And then ... I 've heard of the boiling sea , but in person , it 's even more amazing . As are you . Oh ! Careful .   I 've never met a human quite like you , Alice . I 've never met a genie quite like you . Well , actually , I 've never met a genie , so ...  Okay . Forgive me . I 'm not used to ... I was always the one granting the wishes , not making them . Making them ? What ? For 100 years , I was tethered to a bottle , a slave to the faulty dreams of man , and all that time , I only had one wish ... to never be a prisoner again . And now ... I have another . Wait . I ... I think the people in you world do this down on one ... Yes . What ? Yes , yes , I will ... Our hearts are entwined . From now on , I 'll know when you are near , and you will know .   Alice , run ! When your father found you , you were inconsolable . You said the love of your life was gone , murdered by some ... No , that 's ... that 's not what I said . Alice , you were an ignored little girl who wanted to be loved , so you created a fantasy land full of characters who 'd help you become who you wanted to be ... tall , brave , beautiful . You would n't be the first child to do this . You 're just the first to grow up and still believe it was real .  No .  I do n't believe it anymore . We know you 're lying . You still cry out for him in your sleep . - What ? - In your sleep . Every night , it 's the same .    Mind if I borrow him ? Cyrus , no ! Cyrus !  Alice !    Oops .  Cyrus ! Cyrus ! No ! Cyrus .  Alice ? We have a new procedure that can take away your pain . Make you forget whatever ... Or whomever you 're holding on to . One treatment . It all just ... slips away . Does it hurt ? A little . But far less than the pain you 're in right now .  Just sign here . Good girl . Now go get some sleep . Tomorrow your life begins anew .   Cyrus .  It 's time . Fetch the girl .   Could you at least give me time to get dressed ? You . Come now . We have to go . Go ? Oh , no . You 're not real . Oh , I 'm very real , and we must leave now . I 've cleared out some of the guards , - so we should be able to get out ... - No , I ca n't . I ca n't . Alice , you need to listen to me . No , I 'm not going anywhere . Why must you always be so bloody stubborn ? There he is .  - I did n't do anything .  - It 's true . I mean , if she was the least bit helpful , we would have been long gone by now ... ow ! Get him out of here . Alice , no ! You know me ! You remember . - I do n't want to remember . I want to forget . - Alice , listen to me . - No ! - He 's alive . The rabbit saw him . You know as well as I do , Alice .  Nothing 's impossible in Wonderland .   Uhh ! Uhh !       Aah !    Was that your idea of a rescue ? Well , it was supposed to be more of a message delivery type situation . I was n't planning to ... Right , let 's go then . You 're late . What a surprise . To you , everybody 's late . True . I do have high standards . Nice world you got here . Oh . What the hell is this stuff ? It 's pretty hard on the paws . Alice ! Stop . Do n't do this . I can help you get better . Are we really going to stand here and listen to this guy ? Seeing things , doctor ? I hear there 's a procedure for that . Look out !  Out of the way !    Out of my way !  Oh , no . We 'll be pinched for sure . No , we wo n't .  - They 're coming . - Rabbit ! Here ? Could n't we find somewhere with softer ground , like a field ...  Dig ! All right .  Here goes .   What are you waiting for ? ! Alice , I did n't exactly leave that place on good terms . Neither did I , but if Cyrus is ... Then you have to go , not me . Listen , Knave . Once long ago , I got you back your heart . Now ... you need to help me get back mine .  Down there ! Or you can take your chances with them . Bloody hell . All right , then . Next stop ... Wonderland !.. This bloody ... Place !  Careful , Knave . We 've landed in the mallow marsh . Of course we did , because a pond made out of dessert topping - makes perfect sense .  - Come on . Shake a leg .  Shake two legs .    Ugh ! What a mess . Okay , Rabbit . Where 's Cyrus ? Tell us where you saw him . Well , I did n't exactly see him . Did you tell her I saw him ? - That is what you said . - It was a figure of speech . Nope . I 'm pretty sure it was n't . Uh , what I meant was , I was having tea with the Dormouse , and he said that he saw him . So we came all the way here on the word of a narcoleptic rodent ?  Ignore him , Rabbit . Go on . And he ai n't never coming back . He 's found himself a nice little life back in the place I was makin ' mine ... a place , I might add ...  where the dragonflies are n't actually dragons . Rabbit , are you getting taller ? Yeah , quite possibly . That kind of thing happens quite a lot around here . We 're sinking .  I ca n't move me feet . Rabbit , where is it ? Where 's the Hatter 's house ? Where else ? The Tulgey Woods . Knave , we need to get out of here .  Really ? Uh , everything 's gon na be fine . I 'll just , uh ... uh , uh , I 'll go get help ! Do n't worry ! Everything 's going to work out just fine ! Stop moving . We 'll just sink faster . Oh , because a slow death is so much more pleasant . This is humiliating ... never mind . The point is , we 're gon na die .   Knave , that 's brilliant .    What the bloody hell are you doing ? - I 'm making a smore . - S'mores ! Whatever . I 'm starting to think you were in the nutter for a reason . See ?  Come on .   Where 's that rabbit ? It 's getting late , and I plan on sleepin ' in me own bed tonight . You ca n't leave . We have n't found Cy ... Cyrus . Exactly . You heard what the rabbit said . He never even saw him .  If I 'd known that , I would n't have done any of this . I mean , for all we know , he is n't even alive . What if he is ? Alice ... They have their reasons , and to be honest , they 're good reasons .  I left this place for a future I 'm quite keen to see , and you want me to risk all that for a hunch ? I can pay you . How ? You do n't have anything to pay me , Alice . That 's not entirely true . I have something better than money .  Wishes . I do n't get it . Why do n't you just use ' em to bring Cyrus back ? Wishes can be ... unpredictable . If I used one to bring Cyrus back , he might arrive hanging from a tree with a noose around his neck . See , with wishes , sometimes there 's literally a string attached . Then one just has to be careful what they wish for . Make it consequence-proof . Yeah , I can do that . So does that mean you 'll stay ? We find Cyrus , I get a wish .  So you really believe the rabbit , then ? I know you have your doubts , but , yes , I believe the rabbit .  Oh !   Oh , no . Huh . Oh . - There you are , Rabbit . - Oh ! My ears ! Oh ! Uhh ! Do you mind ?   Your Majesty , I can explain . You 're late . I know . I know . I ... I 'm so sorry . I came as soon as I could . So you told Alice what you heard ? Yes , that Cyrus was alive . Is he ? I 'll be the one asking questions . Right . Right . So this makes us all square then ? You said if I got her here , I 'd get ... I said we 'd settle up when the game was complete . We are still setting up the board . I need more than my eyes . I need your ears , and you will either help me , darling ... Or decorate this room . Understood ? Yes , Y ... Your Majesty . Now leave .    The Tulgey Woods . The Hatter 's place is on the other side . Are n't you worried this is all a trap ? If there 's a chance that Cyrus is alive , we have to take it . Right . Let 's go . The Red Queen ... you said it was also her who threw Cyrus into the boiling sea . Why would she do that ? I do n't know , but I 'd love to ask her and see the look on her face when she realizes I 'm not the forgiving sort , particularly when said face meets this branch , repeatedly . Does n't sound like you . The doctors said I 'm a danger to myself and to others ... when I thought Cyrus was dead , I stopped believing in much of anything .    Well ? She 's back . And what is the girl doing now ? Looking for her genie , of course . Is n't that what we wanted , Jafar ? What we want ca n't be accomplished until we have the genie 's bottle and the girl 's made all her wishes . So I 'd say perhaps you should n't be so pleased with yourself . Do not talk down to me , Jafar . I 'm the Queen . That 's the thing about power . Hmm . It can be so fleeting .  Is that a threat ? No . Threats are for people who are n't prepared to act .  Wait . You need me . Not anymore . But I did what you could not . I ... I brought Alice back to Wonderland . Which means your work and your usefulness to me is done ...  where she is ?  Do you ?    That 's right . You do n't . Now you 're not in Agrabah anymore , darling . This is my world , which means only I know exactly where she is . Only I know exactly where she 's going . So if you want my help , yes ... our deal remains . I will get you those wishes . In return for what , exactly ? All in due time . So why do n't you get on that raggedy carpet of yours and fly away ? And let me take care of Alice . For your sake ... I hope you do .  We 've been walking forever . We should be at the Hatter 's house by now .   Oh , bloody hell . What exactly did you do after I left ? Do n't ask . We need a different point of view . What do you mean ? If I get high enough , I can see the Hatter 's house . Enough of these .  I can see it ! The Hatter 's place ... it 's not that far ! Knave ? Will ?    Cheshire . It 's you . You gave me a fright .  Chesh ? You remember me , right ? It 's Alice . Yes , I remember . You look ... different . Everything does , does n't it ? Wonderland has grown stranger . I 'm stranger . You 're stranger . Together we are ... strangers . Well , then ... how do you do ? Now that we 're friends again , you would n't want to eat a friend now ... Would you ? Mmm , certainly not without pepper .  The pickings are slimmer these days .        The Red Queen promised you would be the sweetest meat I 've ever tasted . Let 's see , shall we ?     Oi !   Now then ... Go pick on somebody your own size .  I ca n't believe it . You . You were ... Brave ? Daring ? ... Stealing my wishes . Oh , that . I think maybe you misunderstand . I was just protecting the wishes . You expect me to believe that ? Not really , no . But can we focus on the part where I came back and saved your life ? You know you ca n't steal a wish . It has to be granted . Of course I did . Everybody knows that . Let 's go get Cyrus . Knave .  Over there ! Hurry ! Cyrus ? ! Cyrus ! Cyrus . I 'm here . Alice . He must be here . It 's too dark to tell , or maybe he 's sleeping or something .  Oh , here you are . I 've been looking all over . I showed up with a whole troop to pull you out of that marsh , but you were gone . It 's okay , Rabbit . Just dig us back home . Cyrus ai n't here . No , he must be here .  Alice ... Alice . I 'm sorry . But he 's not here . And as far as I can tell , he never was . Maybe ... Maybe the Dormouse just named the wrong house , or ... Rabbit , enough . If Cyrus were here , would n't he have shown himself by now ? So he really is gone . Alice .  You made her lose Cyrus twice . Why would you do that ?  Will , Rabbit , come quickly ! He 's alive . Nothing could survive the boiling sea . If it survived , so did he . Alice , that necklace ... it 's magic . That 's why it survived . The guy wearing it ... he was just flesh and blood . He 's gone . I 'm sorry . Now let 's get out of here . The rabbit can dig his hole . You can make a new life , meet somebody else . - No . - No ? I 'm not going . Alice , this is n't the time to be stubborn . I 'm not being stubborn . Yes , you are . If you want to leave , leave . But I 'm staying . Because of a necklace ? Because he 's here . But you have no proof . When you really love someone , you do n't need proof . You can feel it . He 's here . I 'm gon na find him . Only question is ... Is that a " yes " ?  Bloody hell . Come on then .   Alice .  No !

So now which one 's Mr . Sheffield and which one 's Miss Fine ? She named her hamster after me .  Oh ... How can you tell them apart ?  Fran 's the fat one . She 's not fat . She just has big hair . Oh , no , Mr . Sheffield is fighting with Miss Fine . He 's not fighting with her . He 's having - -  Mr . Sheffield , get off of Miss Fine . Miss Fine has a headache . Oh , look , Mr . Sheffield has already fallen asleep . Okay , kids , go bring Miss Fine upstairs and give her a chew stick . She 's not satisfied . Miss Fine , this month 's " Soap Opera Hair Magazine " has arrived . The bigger is better issue ?  Uh-huh . Fran , I ca n't believe you 're doing that ? Why , honey ? Did you think that I got this fullness naturally ? Oh , no . This is just an outer shell . Inside I 've got gel , mousse , volumizer . There 's a whole infrastructure going on in there . The only difference between me and the kingdom is astroturf . Fran , do n't you care about ecology ? There are chemicals in here that are unsafe . Some of that stuff is toxic . Honey , you want to clean up toxic waste , start with Brighten 's bathroom . Fran , I 'm serious . Give me that .  Oh , no , no , I did n't do the tendrils yet . Oh , boy , I 'm getting a weird flashback here only you 're me and I 'm my mother .  What are you talking about ? I was young too once , out to save the world . Lemon Tang was never the same . Mr . Sheffield , if you were my cousin Marsha and you saw me in this dress , what would you do ? I 'd , ah , tell you you looked fabulous and then trash you the moment you left the room . And ? And , um , eat an entire Sara Lee pound cake ?  There you go . For a minute there I thought I was going to have to change . Is n't it a little sedate for you , Nanny Fine ? You do n't look like you 're trying to get a sailor to buy you a champagen cocktail . Where you headed ? A funeral ? As a matter of fact , I am . My great Aunt Mema Fager . She was 104 . Oh ... well , how 'd she die ?  Childbirth . Fran , tell dad he 's being totally unfair . Mr . Sheffield , you 're being totally unfair . Oh , right , what 's the big deal ? Maggie and Mark want to go to an all-night save-the-earth - - all night ? Oh , honey , kiss it off .  Fran , they 're having a candlelight vigil for animal rights . Oh , that reminds me , I got ta pick up the pastrami platter . You know if it sits too long , it gets that rainbow batina thing happening . I ca n't believe you . Is this what happens when you turn when 21 ? 21 ... Do n't mock the child , Niles . Look , Maggie , why do n't you and your friends take it in turns to save the planet ? Hum ? You could take the day shift and then someone whose parents are out of town could take the night . Oh , fine . I 'll go stand in the hole in the ozone layer . Be sure to wear sun block . I read somewhere that the primary-care giver should always agree with the guy that writes the checks . Uh-huh . Thank you for your support . But for your information , I am too young to be on the pig side of a generation gap . Huff and puff as much as you like , Miss Fine . This little piggy is not letting her go . That does n't mean I 'm not thrilled Margaret has a social conscience . I just wish there were more people like her . Oh , are n't the elephant tusks exquisite . They came from that cute little poacher in Kenya . And here I thought you 'd had your wisdom teeth pulled . So when you 're watching " Gorillas in the Mist , " you 're thinking in a fajita , I bet they 're not so bad . It was a gorgeous funeral . Ah , Mema Fager did n't look so hot . May she rest in piece . She could never pull it together from a special occasion . How 's the corned beef ?  Fatty , Daddy . No good . What do you do when you like something ? Eat the Corning Ware ? So when are you due ?  Grandma , I 'm not pregnant . So stop eating . Morty , turn the set down . We 're mourning in here . Meanwhile , explain to me green carnations on a casket . St . Patty did n't drop dead . Why did n't their side spend a little on flowers like we did . Syl , their side never did as well as us . What well ? My daughter 's a maid . Nanny , Ma . Meanwhile , I wonder who got the coat .  What coat ? Mema 's mink . She slept with it more than she slept with Oscar . Mema 's husband 's name was Louie . Yeah . I think it 's a copy of the will . You know , I always offered to drive her to her checkups , even after the bladder went . Save it , Marsha . It 's already written . She 's not coming back with an erasure . Aunt Frita got Mema 's diamond wedding ring .  Ahhhhhh ... I wanted that . Cousin Judy got the blender .  Ahhhhhh ... I could have used that . Uncle Morey got the pasta machine .  Ahhhhhh ... . That they could have . Who cares about their side . Let 's get to our side . Their side , our side . Who 's keeping score ? Meanwhile , it 's three zip .  Oh , please , Ma , calm down . You 're svitzing already . Soon you 're going to slide off the couch . This is such a trying time for me . Life wo n't be the same without my beloved Mema .  Shut up , Marsha . I won . May she rest in peace . She gave Fran the coat ? Who schlepped her to the beauty parlor every week to get her three hairs set ? Who smeared her with BenGay after shuffle board , and after she got the hammer toe fixed , who lugged her around ? My husband , that 's who . Well , you can keep the coat because I do n't want it . What are you nuts ? Why ? Ma , I only wear fake fur . And do you know why ? Yes . Because no one ever died and left you a real one before . No . I have a very impressionable teenager at home that needs to know that I stick by my beliefs , and I believe in animal rights . Fran , a mink is not an animal . It 's a rodent . If it was up in the attic , you would be the first one to call Terminex . Ma , knock it off .  No , I 'm not . And do we have to discuss this in front of everyone ? No , we 'll discuss it in there .  Fine . Excuse us . They do n't want to talk in front of us . How could you turn your back on everything that I raised you to believe in ? This is mink . Ma , if you love the mink so much , why do n't you keep it ? I 'm too busty . Did n't stop you from wearing a tube top to Temple . It 's reform . Ma , forget it . I 'm not taking the coat . You know , you 're killing me with this . If I die tonight , you 'll never forgive yourself . Ma , I 'm a grown woman . You ca n't use guilt on me anymore to get what you want . Oh !  What 's the matter , Ma ? Nothing . I just hope I 'm not getting that weird flesh-eating disease . There was one call - - a sob , a sigh , and a long plaintive oy ... Well , either that 's her or AT T is really depressed that we switched to Sprint . I ca n't believe she would stoop to crank guilt calls . How low can she go ?  Hey , you 're talking about a woman that could grow a tumor on command . Ha , ha , ha . Excuse me .  Well , it 's not going to work . I 'm a grown woman . I 'm entitled to my own opinions , and no silent treatment is going to make me compromise my ideals . That coat is staying in Queens .  Thank you . Oh , can you believe her . Oh , no , Niles , it 's absolutely repulsive . I ca n't stand it . Up or down . Oh , take it off me . Take it off . Oh , look , at the initials , M.F . , Mema Fager -- Miss Fine , like it was meant to be . Well , you could always send it to Morgan Freeman . Oh , Mema . It smells just like her , Chalimar and stuffed cabbage ? I remember when I was a little girl in the winter . She would bundle me up in her coat with her , her bosoms right on top of my head . My ears never got cold . I looked like Princess Laya until Mema got older . Then I looked like Goofy . Funny , as a lad , I do n't ever recall wearing bosoms as a hat . Although , once at a butlers ' convention - -  Do n't take me there , Niles . Oh , my God . Oh , I inherited this , but I refused to accept it . Then why are you wearing it ? Ah , I 'm just indulging Niles . He wanted to see me in it . All right , already , are you happy ? Can I take it off ? Geez . Niles , I 'm surprised at you .  Oh , forgive me , Miss Margaret . I 'm such a beast Good morning , everyone ... But Dad . Niles , thank you so much for buying glass bottles instead of plastic ones at the market . My pleasure , Miss Margaret . I 've always wanted to know what a hernia felt like . Are n't you joining us , Maggie ?  Oh , no . While you leisurely sit here and eat , hundreds of acres of rain forest are being destroyed . So you 're taking your croissant back to the biosphere . Sit down , Margaret . Hello , hello . What was that ?  I asked what she would like on the side . Bacon , sausage , Mighty Dog ? Whoa ! Oh , it 's so nice sitting here with all of you . I feel like part of the family . Good morning , Stacy . Gracie .  Thank you ... Brighten . So , kids , what 's new ?  Miss Fine 's having a baby . What ?  Who 's the father ? Why , Mr . Sheffield of course . Miss Fine , what on earth is all this about you being pregnant ? Pregnant ? Me ? Oh , that 's impossible . Well , it 's not impossible . Oh , yeah , it 's impossible . Miss Fine and Mr . Sheffield are hamsters .  Oh , I knew I left something out . Oh , please , no animals in the dining room . I will be in the office .  Oh , very good , sir . Oh , Miss Fine , why do n't you just take the blasted coat and have done with it .  No ... Why ca n't Fran have an opinion different than her mother 's . Children should have the right to make their own decisions and live their own lives . You can have any opinion you like , Maggie , just do n't have it in the park after dark with Mark . Oh , there 's your poetry . Now you do n't have to go .  Oh ... Oh , come on , Miss Fine , how 'd you make up with your mother in the past ? Well , when I was a little girl , I would put a napkin on my head and sing " Sunrise , Sunset . " At eight it 's adorable . At 30 , they 're giving you 3,000 units of Thorazine . Well , if there 's anything I can do . What does that have to do with anything ?  Well , my mother responds to good looks . She always said you reminded her of Dave from Alvin and the Chipmunks . The cartoon ?  Yeah . She had a thing for George Jetson too , but he 's a little more goyish . Oh , Niles , is n't Mr . Sheffield a doll for going to all the trouble of inviting my mother here for dinner ? Yes . He 's really knocked himself out . Did you stock the bar ?  Yes , Miss Fine , we have Chevitz , Pins , Schnider - - what does Sylvia like to drink ?  Diet Slice . Oh , will Fresca do ?  No , it does n't have to the zest of lime in it . Fine , now I 'm going to have to go out ... Hi .  Oh , Miss Fine . Oh , this should be an interesting dinner , sir .  Oh , good God . Well , perhaps you can swap stories . You can tell her how you started in the theater , and she can tell you how she removes unwanted hair . For heaven sakes , we 've got to get someone else for dinner . Well , it is Saturday night , sir , and most people do have a life . Well , I 'm off .  Ha , ha , ha , ha . Cee Cee , by any chance are you free tonight ? No . I have to pick up my grandfather from the airport . Old thing 's in wheelchair with a respirator - - why ? Well , I was just wondering if you 'd care to join me for dinner ?  Done . Love too . What about , what about your grandfather ?  Oh , he 'll get a sky cap . He 's loaded . He 'll put a 20 in his mouth and wave it . No , no . I just ca n't do this . It 's not a problem . The old guy 's in a wheelchair . It 's downhill from La Guardia . No , you see , it wo n't be just us . I 'm afraid Miss Fine and her mother will be there . Oh , I hate that woman . Which one ?  Pick . Really ? Sylvia 's always saying what a beautiful , charming , sophisticated woman of the world you are . Really ? Those were her exact words ? Oh , that reminds me . I have to get the name of your manicurist . Sylvia 's always going on about how beautifully young your hands look . I 've always adored Syl . But if you have a more pressing engagement , then of course - -  Forget about gramps . I 'll call the airline . They 'll stick him where they put the skis . Niles , another place sitting on the table and make it right next to my pal Syl . Get the name of your manicurist indeed . I learned from the master . There was a Cee Cee , but Miss Fine ate her . Is n't that adorable . The kid collects vermin . Syl ... Is that you ? Yeah . I was invited . Shame on you girl friend . Why have n't we done lunch ? Because when you saw me eat a chicken , you had to take an Advil . Oh , hi , Ma . What a nice surprise . Gee , I did n't know Mr . Sheffield invited you for dinner . You want a diet Slice ?  No , thanks . It gases me up . Come on , sisealla . Oh , this ring is stunning .  My aunt gave it to me . Oh , it 's a family heirloom . How nice of you to not throw it back in your aunt 's face . Ma , would you cut me some slack ?  Why wo n't you wear a stinking coat . You watch your tone of voice , young lady . He 's talking to Maggie . Maggie does nothing . She 's a good daughter . And what am I ? Patty Davis ? This is just like when you refused the mother-daughter kaftans that I bought us . Six years old and a turban ? That 's it . I wash my hands of you . Oh , Mr . Sheffield .  Oh , oh , she 's getting away . Niles , the napkin .  No . Oh , no . Yes , Miss Fine , yes , yes .  Oh , no , no , no . " Is this the little girl I carried ? " Fran , that 's not fair .  " Is this the little boy at play ? " Bomb , boom , bomb .  " I do n't remember growing older . " " When did they ? " Oh , Fran , I 'm sorry .  I 'm sorry too , Mom . Oh , Syl ... Oh , please , it 's over .  Oh ... Oh , Ma , I do n't want to fight anymore . Me neither . It 's just such an honor that Mema chose you . She came to this country with nothing . She worked , she sacrificed . This coat symbolizes the struggles of our family . Ma , she won it on the " Price is Right . " Fran , you should keep the coat . After all , you 're the one who always says family comes first . Oh , all right . I 'll keep the coat . Oh , I never thought I 'd hear you say those words . But just in case , I got it right here . Oh , but I ca n't wear it . All right , maybe just around my Cousin Marsha because it will kill her , and then at least the minks wo n't have died in vain .  Why not ? That is the most beautiful coat I have ever seen . I 'll give you $10,000 for it right now . Oh , no , I 'm sorry . This coat - -  Looks better on a blond .

Sir , I know I 'm a little late . I 'm sorry . It could n't have been helped . I ran into Bo Youngstreet . I think I told you about him . He owns a couple dozen oil wells outside Tulsa . Sit down . I would n't have given him any time , but he 's putting together a new development deal . Brand-new syndicate . I think it 's got very good possibilities . Wesley , let me ask you something . What do you do for a living ? Sir ? Oh , I know what it says on our office door . Wesley Corman , DDS . But I see you so seldom around this office , I do n't know , I thought perhaps you 'd taken up some other profession . For five years now , you 've been my son-in-law as well as a junior associate in my practice . And in both of those areas you 've been a crashing failure . The only reason I put up with you is because my daughter , misguided though she was , loved you . Well , now , happily , that condition 's just about ended . What are you talking about ? Do n't look so surprised . I put Liddy in touch with an excellent divorce attorney . In just a matter of weeks now , your relationship will be terminated . Now , hold on a second . We have our problems like every other married couple , but if divorce was ever mentioned , I know she was n't serious . Serious ? She 's damn serious , and so am I . Wesley , you are a compulsive gambler , but I have paid your last gambling debt . Bailed you out of your last tight spot . Dependent on me ?  One race horse , $20.000 . Died of heart failure second time out of the gate , and he was uninsured . That big land development deal down in Ensenada , $100.000 down the drain . And I have a whole list of gambling debts that I paid for you , from Las Vegas to Atlantic City . Well , I intend to collect . Sir , I think you realize that ... That I wo n't be able to make it if you hold me to those notes . Wesley , you 're amazing . You knew this was coming about for some time now . And yet , you could n't face it , could you ? Well , no more , my friend . No more . Wait a minute . Are n't you forgetting ? Six years ago , I saved your daughter 's life . This time , that 's not going to work . Wesley . How you doing ? Good , good . How are you ? Well , I 'm in good shape . Great . Listen , I need a favor . How much do you need ? No , I do n't need to borrow any more money . Yeah , sure . As a matter of fact , I expect to pay you back next week . That 'd be nice , Wesley . Yeah . The reason I 'm calling is to ask you to change your 2:00 to 12:30 . Can you do that ? Yeah . It 's no problem . Terrific . You got it , buddy . Great . Yeah , 12:30 sharp . I 'll be there . Uh-huh . I 'll see you then . Adam , thanks . You saved my life . No big deal . He did . As consolation , you and the other girls can take an early lunch . Well , thank you , sir . Have a good time . You , too . Hi . Hello . Look , I 'm only going to be a few minutes , so park it up front for me , would you , please ? Sure . Thank you , sir . Thanks a lot . I agree . Adam Evans ! Adam Evans ! Oh , my gosh ! Oh , my God !

You can hang your jacket on the back of the door . I really appreciate your coming in early like this . Hey , no problem , Wes . We had to cancel all our appointments . I would have canceled yours if you were n't going to Cannes tomorrow . I 'm glad you did n't . So , you starting a new film or going on vacation or what ? No , I 'm going to a film festival . Is that right ? Sounds like a good time . Yeah , we 're going to have a good time . Well , I 'll try not to make you late for the plane . How 's that ?  That 's good . All right , se ? or . Lower left bicuspid . You got a lot of decay around the filling here . But what I think needs immediate attention is the crown on the right side . Okay . You 're the doc . All right , let 's put some light on you . And we 'll numb you up here . Chew down , that 's it . Heard any good jokes lately ?  Easy , easy . Almost there . Great .  That 's not too bad . No . Wake me when you 're done . Let 's have a look . Feel that ? Uh-uh . Good . Yeah , she 's loose . Pull her right out of there . There you go .  That did n't hurt , did it ? Uh-uh . All right , do n't you go anywhere . I 'll be right back .  All righty . Get it ? Yep . Now we slap a little concrete on here . And pop her in . Okay . Bite down on that . And ... That 's better than the original . Good . WESLEY : Now , stay away from hot liquids till the Novocaine wears off . You do n't want to burn yourself . Got you . Yeah , I think I did . Yeah . Gosh , she 's a big fan of yours . She 's like a school girl . She 's got cassettes of all the pictures and ...  A big fan . Well , it 's nice to know I have at least one . Yeah , right . Thanks again , Wes . Sure . Take care . You bet . Hi . Do you like what you see ? I do . I did n't hear your car . At those prices , you 're not supposed to . Did you hear from your father ? He called . So you heard the good news . Wesley , do n't . Well , Lydia , sometimes you get the goldmine , sometimes you do n't . We agreed it would be the best thing . No . I never did . I could n't , Lydia . You know how much I 've always loved you ... I tried , Lydia . I really did , in my own way . If it was n't enough , then so be it . You know , after what happened to your first husband , when you needed help , I suppose I knew I was just a crutch to lean on . But now that you 're cured , I guess the reality is I was a guy who happened to be there . I just was n't the right guy . Wesley , I 've been lonely for a very long time , and I suppose you 'll find out sooner or later , so ... What ? Another guy ? Yes . He is ... Lydia , I do n't want to know his name . I think you 're grown up enough to ... No . No , after the divorce is final , after I 'm gone , fine . But do n't cut me into little pieces now . All right . Lydia , I know you 've had a rough time these past couple of years . I always will . Thank you . Lydia , I just want you to know I love you .  The game 's at John Valentine 's tonight . I 'll be there if you need me . Do n't forget to take your medicine . I wo n't .  ADAM : Hello ? Hi . Are you alone ? He just left . Will he be back soon ? No , no , he wo n't be back until late . Which will give me plenty of time to convince you to take me with you . Yeah . We 'll talk . LYDIA : I 'll be waiting . Well , friends , I got nothing but a little old flush .  I think a full house beats a flush . VALENTINE : That 's amazing . It 's only 9:00 , I 'm already getting killed . The evening is young , darling . Hang in there . Deal the cards , bunky . VALENTINE : All right , ante up .  He said he did n't want to know anything about us . You sure he does n't know about us already ? You do n't know Wesley . If Wesley ca n't bet on it , he 's not interested . That 's too bad . I 'd prefer it if everything was out in the open . I would , too . It will be soon , thank God .  Thank God . Yeah . Cheers . Cheers . Is it up to par ?   Delicious . You make the best damn margarita I ever had . VALENTINE : Be kind to me , girl , be kind to me . NANCY : I do my best . RON : Down and dirty . Interesting . RON : Down and dirty . I got ta see that , and raise 100 . DAVID : Fold . And the host is in . I 'm in . Call . I 'll call , and raise it 50 . On what ? You got zip . Who asked you ? Well , excuse me for living . I call . MAN : Uh-oh . Take me to Cannes with you . Mmm . Cause talk , nasty talk , you still being married . Besides , it 's only for five days . Five very , very , long , long days . When I get back , you and Wesley will have done what you have to do , and you and I will have the rest of our lives . I 'm in for 100 . I call . I ca n't believe it . Anybody who 'd play a hand like this has got ta be a total masochist . Jesus , I ca n't believe it . Call . Jesus . I do n't think so . Yeah , call . How do you like them apples ?   LYDIA : Adam ? Adam ? Adam ! Adam ! Adam . Adam , do n't die ! Adam , do n't die ! You ca n't die ! You ca n't ! Too rich for me . I fold . My fellow Americans , I thought this was supposed to be a kinder , gentler game .  Call . Adam , do n't die ! Adam ! Too expensive . Well , it 's just you and me , Nancy .  Adam !  Oh , I forgot . You were in , too , were n't you , Wesley ? You are still in , are n't you because I have no recollection .  I just ca n't ...  Excuse me . Yeah , yeah , I 'm in . Yeah ? Help ! Help , it 's an emergency ! It 's a heart attack ! The address ... The address is 322 ... Stop yelling . Quick ! Please hurry ! It 's a heart attack ! Please , help me ! Help ... Okay , okay , who is this ? Lydia Corman ! Lydia , just a minute . Here 's Wesley . And come quick ! Help ! Lydia , what 's happened ? Hurry ! Please hurry ! Adam ! Adam !  Lydia ? David , let 's go . Sorry , guys . The pool house ! DAVID : Oh , my God . WESLEY : Lydia . Lydia .  Oh , my God . What happened , honey ?  It 's all right . It 's all right . He 's dead . Sis , did you call 911 ? Did you call the police ?  He 's dead . He 's dead just like Tony . What are you doing ? Calling 911 . Do n't be a fool . Wesley , the man is dead . Forget about him . I 'm thinking of your sister , David .  We got ta move the body . Get her upstairs . I 'll get him dressed .   All clear ? Okay .        What are you doing to that thing on your roof ? I 'm trying to figure out how to work it . Those things are for cops , you know . Yeah . Well , I 'm a cop . Oh , you 're a cop . I 'm Arnold Schwarzenegger . Hi . Says he 's a cop . Yeah , he 's a cop . Yeah , I 've been on the force 22 years . Been on the force for 22 years . Twenty-two years , huh ? Yeah , believe it or not , I never had a chance to work this thing before . I 'm sorry , Lieutenant . Yeah , that bubble , where do you connect those things ? You plug that in your cigarette lighter , Lieutenant . Oh , the cigarette lighter . The cigarette lighter does n't work . Come on , I 'll give you an escort . Oh , thanks . Now , believe it or not , 22 years on the force , I never had to use one of those things before . Oh . OFFICER 1 : Move it over . OFFICER 2 : Secure that rope down there . One parking stub . Oh , right . Thanks . Check where it 's from , the day it was issued and the time . You got it , Lieutenant . You want some coffee , Lieutenant ? COLUMBO : No , I just had some . You got a match ? No , I do n't smoke . So , what 's the story here ? Well , the ambulance boys think it was a coronary . Coronary ? Yeah . Take a look at this .  Adam Evans . McCULLEY : Yeah . You 've seen him in the movies , right ? Oh , yeah . You know , just Saturday night , my wife ran ... We ran a picture of his . Did you ? Yeah , it was good , too . He was in this helicopter , shooting . What a shame . Oh , yeah , yeah . McCULLEY : Scary , is n't it ? One minute , you 're on top of the heap . Girls love you , lots of bucks . Next minute , snuffed out . Canceled by the grim reaper . Very well put , Sergeant . Listen , have the medical examiner find out what this little white speck is here on his lip . Oh , yeah . Got you . Okay , guys , you can have him . OFFICER : Okay , let 's go . Clear the way . Found them in his shirt pocket . Listen , when you fellas moved the body , did you touch anything ? I mean , like the gearshift ? No , we did n't touch a thing . No ? No . Thank you very much . Sure .  Can I help you ? Good morning , sir . I 'm sorry to disturb you so early . Lieutenant Columbo . Police . Yeah ? Sir , it 's freezing out here . Could I come in ? This coat does n't have a lining . Oh . Yeah , sure , come on in . Thank you very much . I hate to be the bearer of sad tidings , but it seems as though there 's been an accident . A friend of yours , I think . Adam Evans , the actor ? Yeah . Well , they found him this morning up on Mulholland , dead . Oh , no . Oh , my God ! A car accident ? They think it was a heart attack , sir . Sure . Come on in . Would you like a cup of coffee , Lieutenant ? Oh , I sure could use one , sir . How about a bagel ? Oh , I do n't want to put you out . No trouble . No trouble at all . How do you take it ? A touch of cream . Cream 's in the fridge . Help yourself . Mr . Evans , was he a good friend of yours ? Well , he was a friend . He was a patient . Oh , then he did have trouble with his heart . I do n't know , Lieutenant . I was his dentist , not his doctor . Oh , his dentist .  Sounds like I should apologize for something . Well , dentists , they got ta live , too . I suppose . We found these matches in his shirt pocket . Oh . Well , he could have picked those up anytime . Oh , then he was a friend . I mean , he 's been here as a guest in the house ? Yeah . I would n't say he was a close friend . Well , we met him at a party sometime ago , and Lydia , she 's a big fan of his . But he was n't here last night ? Not that I know of , Lieutenant . But then again , I was n't here . Last night was my poker night . I left here about 8:00 . Did n't get back until ... I do n't remember what time I got back , but I did n't see Adam . Very good . What 's that ? These bagels are very good . Thank you . Go ahead . Lieutenant , do you always chew on one side of your mouth ? Oh , no , sir . It 's just when you told me what you did , it reminded me I have this sensitive tooth on the left side . Could be a cavity . I do n't know . I just ignore it . That 's not very smart of you , Lieutenant . Well , I ca n't stand drilling . I mean , it 's not the drilling so much . I ca n't stand the sound . Just thinking about it makes me very ill . You ought to come see me sometime . I use an ultrasonic drill . Thing purrs like a kitten . You wo n't feel a thing . Well , you know , now , that 's just what I need . One of those . Lieutenant , I 'd prefer that you did n't speak to my wife right now . This is just routine , you know . You told me Mr . Evans was n't here . That 's good enough for me , sir . I see . I 'm just checking for the record . You understand . It 's so sad , is n't it ? A young guy like Adam , dying so unexpectedly . You know , I had a cousin once , about the same age . He did n't smoke , he did n't drink , worked out a couple of times a week . Just walking along the street .  Just like that . Mmm . Heart attack ? No , he got run over by a bakery truck . Well , I want to thank you for the bagels and the coffee .  I got everything I need . Appreciate the time . Hey , glad to be of help . Let me show you out . That was Lieutenant Columbo from the police . Now , listen , the only ones who know what happened are you , me , David and Lydia . As long as we stick together , nobody will suspect her of anything . Suspect her ? Of what ? What could they possibly suspect her of ? Dad , do n't worry . Whatever happens , we 're gon na stick by her . It 'll be all right . LYDIA : Wesley ? Yes . Hi . Darling . What have I done ? It does n't matter . It does n't matter . I love you . HORACE : Wesley ? I want to express my gratitude , and I 'm sorry that I misjudged you . I will always be indebted to you . To both of you . MEDICAL EXAMINER : Interesting , Lieutenant . This man 's heart did not attack him . What did ? Medicine you take to prevent heart attacks . Come again , Doctor . Digitalis . There was nothing wrong with his heart ? Nope . But heart medicine killed him ? Cause of death . Ventricular arrhythmia induced by a massive overdose of digitalis . The normal dose is around one milligram . We found a hell of a lot more than that in his body . About twice what it would take to kill him . A milligram ? How much is a milligram ? A couple of grains of salt . Are you saying all it took to kill this man was the equivalent of a dozen or so grains of salt ? That 's close enough . How long did it take ? I mean , to kill him ? Quick . A minute , maybe two . Hmm . Any marks on his body ? Fifty-seven . Fifty-seven ! Minor mutilations and dilapidations , lesions , lacerations , abrasions , incisions , contusions . The man made action movies . He did his own stunts . But here , let me show you . Here , take a look . Any idea what caused that ? Pre-death convulsions , maybe . Convulsions ? Doc , can I make a copy of this report ? Help yourself . Oh , one more thing , Doctor . That little white speck that we found on the corner of his mouth was about the size of a grain of salt . Was that digitalis ? No . That was salt . Salt ? Regular salt ? Yeah . You know , that stuff you put on food . But it says here his stomach was empty . He did n't eat since breakfast . That 's the last time he ate . He had .07 alcohol in his blood . He had a drink before he died ? That 's not all he had . Does that mean what I think it means ? You mean , he was ... Can you think of a better way to go ?  Yes , Lieutenant ? Oh , I did n't expect to see you here . My business is with Mrs . Corman . May I ask what kind of business ? Well , it 's really rather personal , sir . If I could see her , it 'd just take a minute . No , I 'm sorry . Mrs . Corman is not feeling very well . She 's very upset over Adam 's death . Uh-huh . Unless you think it 's absolutely necessary . Well , I 'm afraid it is , sir .  I 'll handle it . Lieutenant , I 'm Dr . Horace Sherwin , Lydia 's father . I 'm sorry , my daughter is n't well . Whatever you came to see her about will have to wait . Look , I only have one question . If I could just ask her that , and then I leave . What is it you want to know ? I just want to know if Mr . Evans dropped by last night . Come on , Lieutenant , I already answered that . Well , he was n't here . Were you here , sir ? No . Then how do you know ? My daughter would have told me . COLUMBO : Did you ask her ? I do n't have to ask her . Why do n't you ask her ? Do it privately . You do it . Just tell me what she says . I just need an answer . I do n't want to upset anybody . Sure , I know , Lieutenant . You 're just doing your job . Thank you , sir . I appreciate that . Lieutenant , Adam Evans was not here . Did she speak to him on the telephone yesterday , sir ? No . She said no . The telephone records indicate that they spoke five times . Five times ? There were five calls . Oh , my God . I 'm gon na have to mention it . I 'm afraid not , sir . Mr . Evans was murdered . WESLEY : Murdered ? COLUMBO : Poisoned by some kind of medicine . Poisoned ? Oh , my God . That 's insane . Lydia , this must be terrible for you . I love you . I 'll always love you . I 'll always be there for you . That 's why it 's important that I know where he was last night , ma'am . Lydia , do n't answer that . You do n't have to answer . He was here . Thank you , ma'am . Did he have a drink ? Lieutenant , she 's not gon na answer any more of your questions . You mean , she ca n't say whether he had a drink ? HORACE : No , she ca n't . She does n't have to say a word ! He did have a drink . Was it a margarita ? LYDIA : Yes . I thought so . And the only drink I can think of that has those two ingredients is a margarita . Where did he have it , ma'am ? In there . Did you make the margarita , ma'am , or did he ? I did . I see . He said that I made the best margaritas in the world . Yes , ma'am . And this was the tequila ? Yes . Ma'am , was the bottle full when you opened it ? Yes . This is the blender ? Yes . And what did you drink the margaritas out of , ma'am ? Over there . The glass . Oh , there 's only one glass . Did you share the drink , ma'am ? No . I ca n't drink . I see . So there was only one glass , and this was it , and it was his ? LYDIA : Yes . I 'd like to take these down to the lab and have them examine them . Lieutenant , you do n't really believe you 're going to find poison in there , do you ? I certainly hope not , sir . Ma'am , your husband mentioned that you have a heart condition . Do you take any medication for it ? Yes . Is that it that I see in your hand ? May I see it ? Thank you very much , ma'am . I do n't think I have to take up any more of your time . I 'll call the lab , and I 'll be leaving as soon as they get here . I 'm sorry to have disturbed you , and I ... I really hope this is the last time I have to bother you . From your mouth to God 's ear , Lieutenant . Oh , one more question , ma'am . After Mr . Evans had his drink , how much longer was he still here ? Just a few minutes , and then he was gone . I 'll have the results of the glass in a minute . Okay . So you pulled out your handkerchief , and it was full of blue blotches ? Yeah , all full of blue blotches . And there were people there . It was embarrassing . I think you better check with your wife . I 'm gon na do that . Thank God it 's only on the handkerchief . But there was poison in the glass and the blender . There was poison in the glass and the blender ? And Mrs . Corman said the bottle was full when she opened it . Ned , do you have a beaker ? Yeah . And full , it contains 750 milliliters . Are these markings milliliters ? Right . Well , that 's about 630 . 630 from 750 , that 's 120 . How much is that in ounces ? About four . Four . Hmm . I 'm gon na leave this here with you , Ned . All right . And thank you very much . Mmm-hmm . Nice shirt . Corman please ? Do you have an appointment ? No , ma'am . Are you in pain ?  I 'm not here to see him about my teeth . Why are you whispering ? Police , Lieutenant Columbo . I 'm whispering ' cause I do n't want to alarm the patients . They look nervous enough already . That 's very thoughtful of you , Lieutenant . Let me just check with the doctor .  FRANCES : Doctor ? Doctor ? Yes , Frances ? Dr . Corman , there 's a ...  There 's a Lieutenant Columbo here to see you . Yeah , send him right into my office . You can wait right in here , Lieutenant . Oh . Thank you very much , ma'am . Oh , look at all these movie stars . Yeah , look at this . Yes . Dr . Corman has many celebrities among his clientele . Oh , Adam Evans . Yeah .  Yeah ? Yeah , he was in a tank . It was in the desert . He come out of the tank , he had a big Japanese sword . Did you see that one ? No , I missed that one . Oh , it was good . Poor man . He was so young . He always lit up the place when he came in for an appointment . As a matter of fact , he was due in for some work the very afternoon of the night he died . Oh , so you just saw him a few days ago ? No , he did n't come in . You mean he never showed up ? Oh , no , Lieutenant . Mr . Evans was far too considerate ever to be a no-show . No , he called the doctor himself to cancel . Thank you , Frances . I 'll take it from here . Sorry , I do n't have much time , Lieutenant . I have a patient who 's waiting . The lab examined the tequila bottle , the blender and the glass . And ? And they found poison , sir . Well , that 's absurd . The bottle was clean , but the residue in the blender and the glass was loaded with digitalis . It 's unbelievable . That 's the same medicine that your wife takes , is that right , sir ? Yes . Are you suggesting that my wife poisoned Adam Evans ? Was anyone else there , sir ? No . But I know that she did n't kill him . Can you think of anyone else who might have had a reason to kill him ?  No , I ca n't , Lieutenant . Adam was very well-liked . I never heard a bad word spoken about him . Now , he ran around with a lot of women if that means anything . Well , thank you , sir . That could be very helpful . Well , I know you got a patient waiting . Thank you very much . Thank you . You know , a fella takes that amount of poison , how does he get in his car and drive all the way up to Mulholland , 10 miles away , and then die ? Exactly what is it you 're trying to say , Lieutenant ? I do n't know , sir . If he was poisoned at your house , and died there , I mean , the body could have been moved . Do you seriously think that my wife killed Adam Evans , drove him up to Mulholland Drive , and pushed his car over the cliff ? Oh , no , sir . And you want to know why ? Yes . I do n't see how she could have moved such a big man from the pool house to the car without help . Would you validate this for me , sir ? My parking ticket ? Sure . RON : I 'm in for 200 . TED : Yeah , me , too . All right , I 'll raise it 100 .  Coming ! Whatever you 're selling , we do n't want any . Oh , I 'm not selling anything , sir . I 'm from the police . The police ? We did n't call the police . Anyone call the police ? No . Go away !  Cut it short . May I come in , sir ? Sure , but I 'm sure we did n't call the police . Were these people here the night before last ? Yeah . May I ask them some questions ? Be my guest . Thank you . My name is Lieutenant Columbo . Excuse me for interrupting your game . I just want to ask you a few questions , and I 'll try to get out of your hair as ... You Nancy Walker ? That 's right . From the Rock Hudson show ? Nancy Walker ? You got it . What are you doing here ?  I 'm playing cards . It 's nice to meet you . Well , it 's nice to meet you , ma'am . Thank you . Wait till I tell my wife about this .  Yes , as I was saying , I would like to establish the whereabouts of Mr . Wesley Corman the night before last . He was here . He was here ? Yeah . And what time did he get here ? I do n't know . What time did Wesley get here ? Well , by the time I got here , he was already complaining that he was down for $2.000 . Yeah , I got here at 8:30 , and he was already here when I got here . MAN : Yeah , that 's about right . I know this gentleman here . Is he somebody , too ? Huh ? Huh ? Oh , yeah , you bet . You bet . Where do I know this man from ? He was on TV . Not in a while . It was ... He 's very big there .  He was in the Easter Day Parade there . He played Rumpelstiltskin . No , no , no . He took it to new dramatic heights . He was marvelous . On TV . On ... No , it was I Love Lucy . That was his greatest hit . I Love Lucy ? TED : Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , the Lucy show . No , no . You mean the neighbor ? Yeah , that 's right . No , the neighbor was a stouter fella .  Yeah , that 's Dom DeLuise . Dom DeLuise ? No . I love Dom DeLuise . But , no , sir , you were ... What was it ? I did Bewitched . By gum , Bewitched . You were wonderful on that show , sir . That was on Tuesday night . I 'm sorry . Okay . Forgive me . So , am I safe in saying that , what , he got here between 8:00 , 8:30 , something like that ? Yeah , that 's right , yeah . RON : Why are you so interested in Wesley ? Is this a serious problem ? This is Ron Cey . This is the baseball player . That 's right .  Who else is here ? Lieutenant , the questions ? You know , the game ? Oh . Yeah , you want to speed it up , Chief ? You see , I got a date to dance with the devil in the pale moonlight . Know what I mean ?  Jack Nicholson . He knows . I love this guy . He knows ! I think we should mention the phone call . What phone call was that , sir ? The phone call from Lydia . Oh , Dr . Corman 's wife called ? VALENTINE : She was hysterical . She ... And what was she saying ? " Help me . " Very agitated . Very ... COLUMBO : About a heart attack ? Yeah . And then what happened ? You were on the phone , sir ? Yeah , I was trying to calm her down , and I said , " Who is this ? " And she said , " Lydia Corman . " And that 's when Wesley jumped up and grabbed the phone . Dr . Corman grabbed the phone when he heard it was his wife that was on the phone ? Right . But she did n't ask for him . She just said her name ? VALENTINE : That 's right . Mmm-hmm . And what did Dr . Corman say when he got on the phone ? He said , " Lydia , what 's wrong ? What happened ? " That 's it ? Yeah , he shouted her name a couple of times , but I think she 'd already gotten off the phone by then . He 's Wes ' brother-in-law . Oh , Lydia 's brother was here ? Yeah . He saw the look on Wes ' face , and , well , he knew that Lydia was having trouble again . Was she in trouble often ? What do you mean by that ? Listen , if somebody made a film of their marriage , it would be called One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest Part Two . Until a couple of months ago , every time we had a game , she would call twice in the evening . Lieutenant , could you tell us what this is all about ? I wish I knew , ma'am , I wish I knew . Well , thank you all very much for your time . Interesting group .  David . Thanks , Wes . I 'm worried about Lieutenant Columbo . What about him ? First of all , he knows the body was moved . HORACE : What ? But that 's not the worst of it .  Digitalis . Now , what I 'm worried about is what happens when he finds out what happened seven years ago . And he will . It 's only a matter of time . Now , I do n't know how the poison got in the glass , but you can bet that Columbo thinks that Lydia put it in there . I mean , how else would it have gotten in ? I think the best thing to do is to put her where no one can find her , like you did last time . But last time she was sick . Mentally ill . Yeah . But so is the person who put the poison in that glass .  Hello ? COLUMBO : Wesley Corman ? Yes . Is David Sherwin with you ? Yes , David 's here , Lieutenant .  It 's 11:00 . All right . Barney 's Beanery ? No , not Barney 's Beanery . It might be better if I do the talking . I wo n't say a word . Do n't worry , not a word . WESLEY : There he is . The raincoat . Remember , he 's a lot sharper than he appears . Sir , sir , your coat . My coat ? Oh ! Oh , thank you very much , yes . Thank you , sir . David Sherwin . How do you do , sir ? Good evening , Lieutenant . Good evening . How are you ? Fine , thank you . You know , I 've passed this place 100 times , and I always thought , " I bet it 's interesting . I 'd like to see it inside . " Have you ever had that feeling ? Yes . So tonight , I pull up , guess who the valet parking guy is ? My wife 's cousin . Really ? Would you believe that ? My wife 's cousin . He should talk to you ' cause he never wins . He had a bar . He lost it . His wife left him . It 's terrible . Tell you the truth , Lieutenant , I do n't have much sympathy for guys like that . Right , sir . May I ask you something ? Your wife , sir , made five calls to the victim on the afternoon of his death . Do you know what those calls were about ? It 's funny you should ask . David and I were talking about that with my father-in-law just before you called . Really ? Yeah . The calls were about a restaurant in Cannes . Five calls ? Yeah . You know , she forgot the name of the place . She had to call him back . They had a mutual friend somewhere , could he pick her up some perfume from Paris , you know , that kind of thing . I see . It 's not going to be easy for me to say . You two have been less than honest with me . I do n't know what you mean . I was at John Valentine 's tonight , and I spoke to the poker players . And I know that your wife called , and I know that she was hysterical . Something about a heart attack . And I know you both ran home to help her . How did you know the game was at John Valentine 's ? From your answering service . You left word where you could be reached . Why did you conceal that information from me ? Tell him the truth , Wesley ? Got no other choice . We moved the body , Lieutenant . David and I moved the body . Right ? Yes , we did . We did it to protect Lydia . I mean , no , I do n't mean that there was something that she 'd done then that ... David , maybe I better explain . They were in bed . They were making love , and just like that , he was gone . Heart attack . Lydia tried to save him . She gave him some of her medicine which , as we both know , can kill somebody if they do n't have the same heart condition that she has . Oh . Maybe you can understand why she 's taken Adam 's death so hard . I would do anything to protect her from the kind of torture that she went through before . So that 's why you moved the body , because you did n't want any connection between your wife and the victim ? Yes . To tell you the truth , if it happened all over again , I 'd do the exact same thing , and I think you would , too . Absolutely . Well , I want to thank you for your candor . You know , up until tonight , this whole case was a total mishmash . Not at all . Thank you . " Beginning to clear up . " What did he mean ? Hard to say . Mrs . Corman ? Mrs . Corman ? Ma'am ? Yes ? Are you all right , ma'am ? What 's happening ? I ... I do n't understand . I do n't understand about the poison . Well , what about it , ma'am ? Well , Wesley told me that you found poison in the margarita glass . That 's true . But , Lieutenant , all I did was make a margarita . I do n't know anything about any poison . Well , ma'am , there are two things that we ca n't get around . He died from digitalis , and there was digitalis in the glass . Actually , there are three . Can we go to the pool house ? Mr . Evans did not die up on Mulholland Drive . He was dead when the car went over the cliff . He died here in the house , probably right there on that couch . Evans were making love shortly before he died . And under those circumstances , not many women would call their husbands for help . They would call 911 , let the paramedics clean things up , then call their husbands . Well , that 's who I called . I called 911 . You called 911 ? Are you sure ? I 'm not sure of anything that happened that night , but I am sure that I pressed the 911 button , yes . On that phone ? Yes , on that phone .   MAN ON PHONE : 911 emergency . Hello ? Hello ? 911 . Sorry , mistake . What happened after your husband and brother came here ? I do n't know . All I remember is Adam collapsing , and then pressing the 911 button . Are those your pills outside on the table ? Yes . " Take as directed . " How many do you take a day , ma'am ? I take two . This prescription for 50 tablets is dated 15 days ago . That means there should be 20 left . Hold out your hand , ma'am . Did you take one today ? Yes . Two , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 . Hmm . Any idea what happened to the other nine pills , ma'am ? No . You think I poisoned Adam , do n't you , Lieutenant ? It does look that way , does n't it , ma'am ?  What are you trying to do , McCulley , kill it ? McCULLEY : The thing took my last quarter , Lieutenant . Well , is n't there a number you can call , or something ? Well , how am I gon na call ? I have n't got a quarter . Oh , you want coffee ? I 'll buy . I would n't trust it .  WOMAN ON PA : Paging Katherine Stewart . You 're wanted in the conference room . You see the morning paper ? Only the ball scores . Big story on the Adam Evans case . That he was poisoned in some woman 's pool house , and then moved to Mulholland . How did they hear about that ? You mean , it 's true ? Yeah , but who tipped the paper off ? Well , I got another question for you . If it 's true , how come you have n't arrested this woman ? ' Cause she did n't do it . How 's that for an answer ? Well , according to the papers , she was the last person to see this guy . She was alone with him . She gave him the drink that killed him . Who else could have done it ? The husband . The husband was at a poker game , four miles away at the time . How do you think he managed it ? If I knew that , I 'd arrest him . Well , lots of luck , Lieutenant . Oh , he 's no good , huh ? You really like the six ? Okay . Did you look at the five ? Oh , okay , then that 's what we 'll do . Right . No , I 'm leaving right now . I 'll see you out there at the top of the first race . No , I 'm leaving ! Right . I 'll see you then . Okay . Bye-bye . Going to the track , huh ? Oh , yeah , big race today . Oh ! Hey , you want a good horse ? A horse ? Yeah , a horse to bet on . To bet on ? What 's his name ? Pinocchio . Pinocchio ? Is he gon na win ? Guaranteed . Guaranteed ? No kidding . The six horse , fourth race . You got a tip ? I got a tip . You got a tip . Oh , sir , are you in a hurry ? ' Cause I can get my business done quick . I 'd appreciate it . I want to be there for the first race . You got it , sir . This Pinocchio , he 's a boy horse ? Oh , this Pinocchio 's a girl . Oh , a girl horse . Mmm-hmm . How 's your luck running ? Lieutenant , I 'd appreciate it . I 'm in a bit of a hurry . I understand , sir . You got it . You 've got my money . That 's why I was worried how your luck was running . Oh , here 's what I was looking for . You want me to validate that ? Oh , this is not mine , sir . No , that 's from the downstairs garage . No , but you see the date ? It 's three days ago . This was the day Mr . Evans died . This was his parking ticket . Oh . What about it ? Sir , I did n't mean to bet the 10 . I was thinking 2 , maybe 5 . What do you think ? Oh , I think you can go the 5 . What about the ticket ? Well , it shows that he parked the car down there at 12:20 . And , what bothers me , sir , is ... You said that he canceled his appointment . Oh , he did . He did ? It 's a big building , Lieutenant . Doctors , lawyers , accountants . He could 've been here and seen anybody . Oh , so he canceled you , and something more important came up . Most likely . Do you know of any other ailment that he had ? I 'm thinking if he saw another doctor , I might check . Lieutenant , please , I have no idea why he was here . All right . Oh , what 's this ? It 's a crown . I do n't keep up with that stuff . I never was any good at chemistry . I put some glue on and pop them in . That 's about it . It looks just like a tooth . If you 'll excuse me , I got ta go . I got ta be there in 30 minutes . I understand . Good luck , Doc . Bye-bye . Oh , sir ! Yes ? Could I just have my $5 change ? Oh . I hope your luck keeps running good , sir . You know , that has a way of changing . Not mine . I 'm on a roll . I 'll see you later .   ANNOUNCER ON PA : Here comes Gray Wonder , tailing just on the outside in second . Then it 's back to Desert Folly in high pursuit . They 're in the stretch . English Pleasure clings on to the lead . English Pleasure and Gray Wonder , those two are stride for stride . Inside the final sixteenth of a mile , actually it 's Gray Wonder up on the outside in front of English Pleasure and coming under the wire ... All right ! Do I know how to pick them or what ? Congratulations , buddy . I told you , that jockey ca n't lose today . Did you put the money on him ? I told you to . Did Pinocchio win , Doc ? No , he has n't run yet . Oh , good . I was afraid I 'd get here too late and miss it . How 's your luck running ? Oh , I 'm on a hot streak , Lieutenant . Great . Do you think I could join you ? Oh , we 're all filled up here . I 'm sorry , Lieutenant . I do n't know what to say . Did you bet my money ? I sure did . Well , that 's the important thing . Excuse me . ANNOUNCER : Ladies and gentlemen ... Things are going good , huh ? Going good , huh ? Very good . Lieutenant , we 're working on the next race . You 're gon na have to excuse us .  Beautiful out here , is n't it ? Yes , it is . Did you bet Pinocchio ? What race is that ? Doc , what race is Pinocchio ? Four . Fourth . Did you bet him ? I bet him , yeah . I got a tip . This fella here next to me , he 's a dentist , but he bets thousands . No kidding ? ANNOUNCER : ... better than $637.000 . Coming up on Sunday ... Remember these , Doc ? You remember them ? I think those were planted on Mr . Evans ' body . Why would you say a thing like that ? I do n't understand how they got in his pocket . Well , I thought I explained it to you , Lieutenant . Now , whenever I borrow a match , it 's because I want to light my cigar . Why would a guy pick up a book of matches , and not use a single match ? I imagine because he wanted to use them later . He had a completely filled lighter in his pocket . Lieutenant , it was n't Adam 's first visit to the house . He could have picked those matches up at any time . Well , I would buy that if I found them in his jacket pocket . But these were found in his shirt pocket , and if he was anything like me , he changed his shirt every day . Uh-huh . I see what you mean . So I 'm stuck . I do n't know how they got there , unless somebody put them there . I wish I could help you . Well , do n't worry about it . If your horse wins , that 's the important thing . Then you 've done your share . No problem , Lieutenant . Right . Say , did you know that in Mr . Evans ' car at the crash site , we found the gearshift in neutral ? Excuse me . This is my seat . Oh , I 'm sorry , ma'am . Did you know that , Doc ? I did n't know that , Lieutenant . Hi . It just seemed strange , you know , when I first saw it , that someone who crashed a car into a ditch during a fatal heart attack , that he would put the gear into neutral . I know what you mean . COLUMBO : I wonder if that could have been deliberate ? Just to make sure that the police would n't simply write it off as a heart attack and let it go at that . MAN : Excuse me . That guy 's a real pain in the butt . Yeah , you got that right . Let 's get back to business . Come here . Sir , I assume you know what your wife and Mr . Evans were doing just before he died ? Yes , Lieutenant , I do know . You do know . I thought you did . But you wanted to protect her anyway . I still do . You must love her very much . She 's got my number , Lieutenant . Well , I 've got some very good news to tell you about her . I also have some not-so-good news . Could we go somewhere where we could talk ? Absolutely . COLUMBO : There are very few husbands that would do what you did . You 're very rare . WESLEY : I really had no choice . COLUMBO : Why do n't we just stand at the bar ? Is that all right ? WESLEY : Fine with me . Would you care for a drink , sir ? Lieutenant , you said you had good news about my wife . I 'd like to hear it . Well , she 's innocent . Well , that 's terrific ! That 's great news ! God , what a relief ! You 're sure ? Absolutely . Red . RED : Yes , sir ? When you have a minute . I 'm gon na show you . We know how much margarita was in the blender because the residue left a mark . Would you do me a favor , sir ? Yes , sir . Would you fill that with water right up to that mark ? Just water , sir ? Just water .  Believe it or not , I used to have red hair . And this is the actual glass that Evans drank the margarita from . Thank you very much . Now , let me show you something , sir . This is gon na put your mind at rest . Mr . Evans drinks his first margarita . Then he drank his second margarita . And we know he had two margaritas . He could n't have . Why not ? Because he would have been dead after the first one . According to the coroner , the amount of poison in that glass , he 'd have been dead in a minute . So , what does this all mean ? Well , it means that there was no poison in the blender when he drank the margarita . None . The poison was put in the glass and the blender after he was dead . The poison in the margarita did n't kill him . Poison from someplace else killed him . Someplace else . Someplace else . So your wife , she 's in the clear . That 's good news , right ? Wonderful news , Lieutenant . Just wonderful . So , what 's the not-so-good news ? Oh , well , that 's a little complicated to explain . Maybe , I better show it to you . Just take a minute . Listen , if she got John 's house , she must have dialed John 's number . COLUMBO : Well , she was having an affair with another man . It 's a big question as to whether she was gon na call her husband . And she 's sure that she pressed the 911 button . Here 's what I think happened . Press the speakerphone . COLUMBO : Now the 911 button .   WOMAN ON PHONE : John Valentine 's residence . That 's what I think happened . I think somebody reprogrammed the 911 button , so that it would ring at John Valentine 's house . Are you telling me that you found the 911 button on that phone programmed to ring John 's number ? No , sir . But whoever changed it originally was too clever to leave it that way . And it only takes a second to reprogram it . Excellent work , Lieutenant . Thank you , sir . Excellent work . Interesting theory . Should I call my lawyer ? Well , that 's up to you , sir .  There 's one thing that puzzles me . Why do n't you arrest me ? That 's a good question . That is a good question . Red , a scotch for the Lieutenant , and I 'd like a glass of milk , please . Yes , sir . It 's my lucky drink . Lieutenant , I assume that when you said you had bad news for my wife , that you meant that her husband not only murdered her lover , but was attempting to frame her for the crime . That is true , sir . I also assume that you 've spoken to my in-laws , and that they told you I was a leach . That I lived off their money , that I manipulated my wife , and they wanted to kick me out . Yes , sir , I did . You found a terrific motive . It sounds right . You think that I murdered Adam Evans . I do , sir . Tell me , how did I do that ? I do n't know , sir . You do n't know . That 's a bit of a problem , is n't it ? It is . Thank you , Red . Well , it 's fortunate I 'm so good-natured , Lieutenant . Somebody else might take offense . Tell you what I 'm gon na do . I 'm gon na go out there and root for our horse . Now , you 're welcome to join me , or you can stay here and try to figure it out . I think I 'll stay here , sir . I thought you would . I 'll see you later , Lieutenant . ANNOUNCER :  And one of the outsiders in here , in fact , a big outsider at 25-to-1 , is Pinocchio . If you do n't come to see me , you 're going to have troubles . It 's killing me . I think it 's a cavity . I 'll do the diagnosing . Open .  That 's beautiful .  What was that ? You got a big problem under that filling . Got ta give you a new one . Today ? Today . I was hoping that we could do it another day . No . I only want some information . Oh ! Information . The man 's tooth is on the verge of abscess , and all he wants is information . I got a theory that is kicking around in my head , and I want to talk to you about it . Let me ask you something . Are things so bad downtown that you ca n't afford a new shirt ? What 's the matter with this shirt ? It 's got all these blue splotches on it . It looks terrible . Oh , that . Laundry bluing . You know what that is ? No . You 're better off than I am . I put it in the laundry , and everything came out with blue spots . Underwear , shirts , my handkerchiefs . And they say that the blue is not gon na come out . Open . Hey , Doc , take it easy , will you ? You think I enjoy this ? That 's the trouble . Nobody loves the dentist . You got any idea how that makes a guy feel ? Try being a homicide detective . Well , at least your wife and dog love you . Last time I tried to clean my wife 's teeth , she bit me . Open . Come on . Ah .  So , while you can still talk , what 's the information ? A guy goes to the dentist , say 12:30 . Now it 's 10:00 at night , and he drops dead from a lethal dose of quick-acting poison . I think the dentist did it , but I do n't know how . Boy , it 's not bad enough we got ta be dentists . Theoretically ? Yeah . I do n't have any idea . Nah . You want to find out something like that , you got ta talk to a better dentist than me . Open .  DAVID : And you believe it ? HORACE : Of course I believe it . A man like Lieutenant Columbo calls me , tells me my daughter is no longer a suspect in a murder . I believe it . No , you believe that Wesley did it ? Well , the Lieutenant 's sure of it . He just does n't know how . HORACE : I suspect that Wesley was a lot more clever than any of us gave him credit for . DAVID : Fooled me . He fooled all of us . But now he 's been found out . Found out ? That 's right . The usual , Lieutenant ? No . I do n't know what I want , but I do n't want the usual . Do n't feel like eating , huh ? No . You got a cold ? No , I was at the dentist . And the Novocaine is wearing off . I think I bit my cheek . I can feel something there . And the tooth is starting to hurt , and I do n't feel like eating , but I 'm hungry . FINN : Want a little advice , Lieutenant ? Go home , take a good shot of whiskey and get right into bed .  Oh , boy .  FINN : Thank you . Lieutenant , Lieutenant . That was the happiest phone call I 've ever received . I ca n't tell you how grateful I am . And so is my son . I ca n't thank you enough , Lieutenant . I am so relieved about Lydia , I ... Well , the best way that you could thank me is if you could help me ... Excuse me , sir . The best way you could thank me is if you could shed some light on how this could have happened . I know that Mr . Evans was in your office building at 12:30 on the day he died from the parking stub . I know he had an appointment to fill his cavity , and I do n't care what Wesley says , I believe that Evans was in Wesley 's office at lunch time , and that 's when it happened . If that 's when he was poisoned , then that 's when he would have died . There 's no way around that . Well , that 's our problem . Excuse me . Finn ! May I have a glass of water , please ? I have to take my pain pill , ' cause it 's starting to act up on me now . Be careful of this ice on your tooth , there , Lieutenant . What will you have ? May I recommend ...  Bless you . You better take something for that . You know , all different colors . Look like candy . Probably a marketing gimmick , right ? No , no , that 's no gimmick . Each one of those colors , they have a purpose . See the beads here in the capsule ? Well , the red ones , they dissolve in one minute , the yellows in 15 , the greens in an hour , the blues in four hours , and whites in eight hours , and so on . Well , you 've seen the commercial . Twelve-hour cold pill . Is n't that something ? Hey , no kidding . I did n't know that . Yeah , they 're very common . Yeah . In fact , these pills here that your dentist recommended , they 're the same thing . That 's how he did it . HORACE : What 's that ? He coated it . He coated the digitalis with a medical time-release gel . And inserted it in a cavity . Well , let 's have them , and we 'll find out . Oh , I 'm sorry , Lieutenant . What 's the matter ? Well , Evans was coming in here to have a cavity filled on a lower left bicuspid . But according to the coroner 's X-ray , it was never touched . Well , that 's not possible . Here , look for yourself . Well , that 's crazy . I know that 's how he did it . Lower left bicuspid , huh ? Wait a second . Gash . Hold the phone , Doc . Gash . Gash . Where did I write that ? Here it is . " Gash in the right cheek . Not the left cheek . " The right cheek . " Forget about the cavity , Doc . They 'll have to wait , sir . Maybe for a long time . I told you that you murdered Mr . Evans .  I told you that I 'd get the proof . Now I got it . You have , huh ? You killed him while he was sitting in a dentist 's chair on the afternoon of the day he died .  That 's ridiculous . You coated the digitalis with a medical gel , something that would dissolve over a period of several hours . When it did , the poison seeped out . It was absorbed through the gums and into the system . Lieutenant , it 's an absolutely lunatic theory . I have to warn you , sir . I 've had Mr . Evans ' body exhumed . We will find traces of digitalis in his mouth . And that , Dr . Corman , will convict you . HORACE : Lieutenant , whenever you 're ready . Do you think you could show me where the cavity is ? Yes , Lieutenant . Lower left , second-to-last molar . You see that black spot right there ? That 's it . - Yes , sir . Dr . Johnson , would you hold these ? And as you have so aptly described it , Lieutenant , that is still a cavity . I have n't touched it , and I assume no one else has . - COLUMBO : You know what the problem is ? I went to my dentist yesterday , and he gave me Novocaine , and the first thing you know , I bit the inside of my cheek without knowing it . And you know something else ? Adam Evans did the same thing . Nasty cut on the inside of his cheek . But the trouble is it 's on the other side , away from the cavity . You know what that says to me ? No , I do n't . Sherwin ? Excuse me . Dr . Sherwin , is that a crown ? Yes , it is . Is that a porcelain crown ? That 's correct . Come on , Lieutenant , give it up . Even if the poison had been put under the crown , the body would have absorbed it by now . You would n't find a trace . But I 'm not looking for traces of digitalis . You know what that is , Doc ? That 's a chemistry set I had as a kid . I gave it to my nephew last Christmas . I 'll tell you , that kid , he 's a whiz at this . Kind of takes after me , actually . I was a terrific chemistry student in high school . Now , watch this . You said it yourself , Doc , that you did n't know a whole lot about chemistry , that you did n't keep up with this stuff . And that 's where you made your mistake . Did you know that just the tiniest bit of digitalis will turn porcelain enamel blue when catalyzed by moisture heated to body temperature ? No , I did n't . You remember this ? Porcelain crown ? I saw one like that in your office the other day . And in this envelope here , I have pure digitalis , which Dr . Johnson was kind enough to give me , and I 'm going to sprinkle this digitalis onto this porcelain crown . Now we heat some water . Not much . Now , I just want to get this water to approximately body temperature . There , I think that ought to do it . Eyedropper . Not much . Now watch carefully . It 's a pity you were so weak in chemistry . Dr . Johnson , hand me that extractor , please . Thank you . Forget it . Just forget it , will you ? There 's no need . Just leave it be .  I could n't believe it when Daddy told me . You would have let me go to prison . Or insane . What I did is no worse than what you and your father had planned for me . OFFICER : All right , let 's go . Oh , man , are you bananas . Let me see that thing . Digitalis on porcelain . That wo n't do a damn thing . You know , the only thing that 's gon na turn this crown blue is something like common , ordinary laundry bluing . Kind of like that stuff you got there in your shirt . Laundry bluing ? Is that a fact ? 
@@5227241 If it 's Thursday night , it 's a no . Why ca n't you make it ... I have to hang up , Thelma . There 's shooting upstairs . They 're all yours , JT . Jeez , what a mess . Whoever trashed this place wanted something bad . That 's what 's bothering me . What would anybody want in a place like this ? Lieutenant , this is Mrs Byrnes , the manager of the building . - She called to report the shots . - As soon as I heard ' em . Never could understand people mistaking ' em for a car backfiring . I 'm sorry , Mrs Byrnes , that you got ta see this , but we do have to have somebody identify the victims . The one with the knife in his throat , that 's Mr Dillinger - JJ Dillinger . We found marks in that window where somebody broke in . It 's probably the guy in the sneakers . Did you ever see that man before , ma'am ? Ca n't say I have . Paid his rent on time . And carried a gun . If you worked nights , you 'd feel safer with a gun too . Would you know where he worked , ma'am ? Silver Lake somewhere . I can check on my rent application . I 'd appreciate that . You 've been very helpful . If there 's ever anything you need . Some more patrols would help . This is the fifth burglary this year . You 'll get written reports in the morning . - Would you like some educated guesses ? - Why not ? Looks like the first bullet hit this one a little low . It probably deflected off a rib . Anyway , that did n't stop him right away . You see the left clenched fist . Probably threw a punch and still had time to stick his knife in the shooter 's throat , probably just as the gun went off for the second time . Looks like the shot went clean through the heart . Knife broke off as he fell . OK , Doc . Thanks a lot . It 's an open-and-shut case , double homicide . - What have you got ? - Burglary tools . Wallet . Let 's see . " Eugene Edward Ehrbach . " Address over on Rossmoor . Fancy neighbourhood . I do n't know whether you noticed , but what 's a guy in an expensive Italian leather jacket doing in a place like this ? Maybe this is what he was looking for . What is it ? It 's a piece of a photograph . What does it look like to you ? Belly dancer at Harrods . Lieutenant , you think a guy would break into this dump for that ? Well , I ca n't figure him climbing two storeys of a fire escape , then through a window , with a piece of a snapshot in his hand . Belly dancer , huh ? What do you think this furry stuff is ? Mud ? Stucco ? Could be anything . I 'm gon na check the records on Dillinger and Ehrbach . Let 's move on . Well , it 's just so strange . I mean , two guys killed each other over this . What the hell is it ? It 's a piece of a snapshot . You know , it 's not like somebody just ripped up a photograph . It 's been carefully carved into this shape . Excuse me . I 'm looking for Detective Brown . - That 's me . - OK to come in ? Come ahead . - Hi . Irving Krutch . Nice to meet you . - How do you do ? - OK to sit down ? - Sure , sit . Oh . So , got yourself a little murder , huh ? The two guys over on Culver Avenue . I read about it in the paper this morning . What about ' em ? I should tell you I 'm an insurance investigator - Translife Insurance . Been with ' em 14 years . Started there right after college , Princeton . Right . - You know something about the killings ? - Yes , sir . What ? The newspaper said you found a piece of a photograph . Is that it ? - What about it ? - I got another one . If you check Ehrbach 's pad , I 'm sure you 'll find a third piece . Mr Krutch , do you want to tell us , or do we have to pull teeth ? - Will you help me ? - To do what ? First , to get the piece out of Ehrbach 's place . - Why do you want it ? - Three pieces are better than one . If you have something to say , would you say it ? Otherwise , have a nice day . - Let me fill you in . - Please do . Six years ago in this city , in broad daylight , on a rainy afternoon in August , four men held up the Culver Avenue branch of the NSLA . - Go ahead . I 'm sorry , I do n't think I got your name . Uh ... Columbo . Nice to meet you . Are you Italian ? - Yes , I am . - The leader of the gang was Italian . Anthony " Tony the Nose " Bonamico . Record as long as your arm . Just got out of Castlefield , where he 's serving a five-and-dime . First thing he does , still on parole , he holds up a bank . The two guns were both ex-cons . Leo D'Amore and Mikey Ryan . A kid named David Stein was the wheel man . It was his first job and he blew it . - Did I mention it was raining ? - Yeah . Car goes into a skid , hits another vehicle , causes a traffic tie-up . Squad car comes , the gang starts shooting , all four are dead within minutes . - Are my facts correct so far ? - They are , yeah . 45 minutes after the hold-up , not a dime in the car . Translife gets called in , Irving Krutch investigating . Result - two years ' intensive search , nothing , gagoots . We finally settle the claim in full . $4 million . Hello ! That was bad . I do n't have to tell you how bad that was . It was especially bad for Irving Krutch , who 's now handling minor claims at less salary than he was making four years ago . May I ask , why do you want these three pieces of the photograph ? Let me ask you , sir , where did the money go ? - Good question . - That was the question . What happened to the money ? I could n't sleep . In fact , for four years , I 've been obsessed with this question . Then I finally got a break a couple of months ago . - I followed up on this . - How did you follow up ? I got a copy of her will . Certain mementos , photographs , a photographic segment , documents , including this list of names . You should know this is in Tony Bonamico 's handwriting . - Why is it torn ? - Maybe it was an accident . But considering the way Bonamico cut the photo , I figure he ripped it deliberately , and somebody else has the other part of this list . And here , also part of Mary 's will , a photographic segment . How do we know that these two pieces come from the same photograph ? Oh , it 's no accident . Both pieces are cut up like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle . And no accident both pieces belong to two names on the list . Mine came from Mary Bonamico 's will and yours came from Dillinger . Plus , yours was found in the dead hand of a third name on the list , Eugene E Ehrbach . Who 's Mo Weinberg ? A buddy of David Stein , who screwed up the getaway . Making sense ? - Not much . Dillinger got arrested for pushing , Ehrbach for burglary . Check it out . What about these other names on the list ? Do they mean anything to you ? I do n't know . I just hope there are only seven . Seven puzzle pieces are enough , do n't you think ? Mr Krutch , once you 've assembled this puzzle , then what ? I will have the exact location of the $4 million stolen some six years ago . How do you know that ? The Italian lady , Mary 's sister , told me . She remembered the photograph showed where the treasure was . In fact , she used the Italian word tesoro . - You speak Italian ? - Tesoro - treasure . So now there are two pieces to the puzzle ? What do you want from us ? Help me find the other five . I ca n't keep breaking into places . - Where did you break in ? - Dillinger 's and Ehrbach 's a few times . So now you want us to break into places for you ? We 're talking about $4 million here . That would be quite a feather in your cap . Am I wrong ? - No , you 're not . - So do it ! - Do what ? - Go over Ehrbach 's with a fine comb . You can do it legally . He 's a homicide victim . OK . - The you 'll have the third piece . - Then what ? Go after Weinberg . Ah . I 'm going to leave you the list and this piece . - You wo n't need them ? - I 've got copies . OK . Here 's my card . Let me know what you decide . Detective Columbo and Detective Brown . They do n't even look like they fit . Some guy comes in with this story . What does he expect us to do ? Drop everything and go on a treasure hunt ? There 's a possibility he 's right . - He said she told him in Italian the picture shows where " tresoro " is buried . - Tesoro . - " Tresoro . " - Tesoro . - Whatever . OK , you guys got one day . That 's it . Check out Ehrbach 's apartment . Nothing there , back to the salt mines . We 're looking for a thing that could be this big , but it could be smaller . - So it could be anywhere . - Yeah , where ? I do n't know . You think he could have rolled it up and stuck it into a cigar ? - It 's possible . - Did you check the cigar box ? I checked it , but I did n't split the cigars . Try it . We might get lucky . - I 've already done that . - I 'm getting punchy . One of those bulbs is out . - Are you doing that with your finger ? - I 'm gon na get cancer of the ... There she is . If he has one . You see the size of this guy 's record ? He 's a professional , habitual criminal . He 's dangerous . He goes around beating up people . He 's not going to cooperate with a police officer . You do n't go to a guy like this and say , " Excuse me ... " You got ta pass as a pusher or a burglar ... You have to go undercover . Who 'll do it ? You ? - No . Him . - You ? - Yeah . - You ? And he does n't even have to change clothes . Move out of your house , get a cheap room . Never come here . Set up a drop with Brown . And you will have to change clothes . I look forward to it . And you have to carry a gun . - I do n't need no gun . - You carry it or you do n't go ! OK . - You look like a cop . - So do you . - Let 's hear it again . - What ? From the top ? From the top . Your name first . Arty Stokes . Salt Lake City . - You ever been there ? - No . Oh , it 's nice . You like to ski ? Supposed to be nice skiing there . Did you call me down here to talk about the Olympics ? No , I thought you might be a skier . - I 'm still waiting for the story . - I already gave it to you on the phone . - Give it again . - Why ? Say I had a poor connection . OK . A couple of weeks ago , I bought a piece of a picture and a couple of names from a guy in Salt Lake City , cost me two grand . - What was his name ? - Bobby Firth . He just done eight years , armed robbery , got out in April . He was busted . - You gave him two grand for this ? - That 's right . Why ? Because Firth told me I can make four million just by fitting my piece of the snapshot into the whole picture . I 'm surprised he did n't try to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge . This ai n't the Brooklyn Bridge , Weinberg , and you know it . So now you have a piece of a snapshot ? - That 's right . - What 's the two names ? - You 're one of them . - Yeah ? And the other one ? I 'll tell you that when we make the deal . What 's these names supposed to be ? The names of two people who also got a piece of that photograph . - Two names ? - That 's right . Your pal tell you how you can get four million pasting the pictures together ? - He did ... - All right . You wan na keep on playing cute , or you wan na make a deal ? - Who else knows about this ? - Nobody . Who did you tell ? You think I 'm crazy ? There 's big money involved here . All of a sudden , you know big money 's involved . All right , Weinberg , this is the deal . You take it or leave it . I put up the name of the piece I got , you put up the name of the piece you got . We find the loot , we split it 50-50 . Yes or no ? We 've got a deal . We 'll meet later at my place and we 'll put everything on the table then . - Where is it ? - 220 South Kirby , apartment 26 . - What time ? - Ten OK with you ? I 'll be there . Just a minute . I 'm in the bathroom . Come in , it 's open . Drop the gun ! No ? Not on the head ? Where ? The knee ? - I was n't going to hit you anywhere . - Were you gon na shoot me ? You kidding ? No . Not shoot me ? That 's how you greet people - hide behind the door with a gun . I thought you were someone else . You had an accident to your head as a kid or were you born retarded ? - You 're insulting me . - You 're insulting me with your lying ! Loosen up , pal . What 's your problem ? - You wan na make two million ? - Yeah . So do I . Here . Your gun . - Do we shake hands all over again ? - I 'd like to . - Let 's see your piece of the picture . - Let 's see yours . Oh , we 're gon na be good partners . Look at this . They fit . - And now the names . - Eugene Edward Ehrbach . - Geraldine Ferguson . - Ehrbach 's dead . What ? He was killed on Wednesday . The cops ... - Dead ? Dead ? - Dead . - Dead ? - Dead . - What is this ? A double-cross ? - You 're gon na have to calm down . I 'll bust your head , that 's what I 'm gon na do ! - He had a piece of the photograph . - Who ? - Ehrbach . - A piece of our picture ? - Why did n't you say ? Where is it ? - The cops got it . - The cops ? Damn , Stokes . - Cops can be bought . Whatever they find on Ehrbach ... I do n't like negotiating with the fuzz . To survive in the city , you got to . - Biggest thieves in the world . Cost you $100 tops . Now , what about this Geraldine ? Ferguson - owns an art gallery . I 've busted into her house six or seven times already . Could n't find a picture . - She probably got it you know where . - You got a copy of that ? Naturally . You ? Naturally . You wan na exchange pieces , is that it ? - That 's it . - Done . Excuse me . I did good . I got a copy of Weinberg 's piece . Take it down to headquarters and keep it with the other three pieces . Captain 's worried about how you 've made out with the muscle guy . Is that right ? Well , you can tell him that Weinberg and I , we hit it off just fine . Tell him I 'll be in touch , and tell the captain I 'm going after the fifth piece . The Geraldine on the list is a Geraldine Ferguson of the Ferguson Gallery . - Hi . - Hi . Are you here for the Ganzagos ? I do n't think so . What are the Ganzagos ? Luis Ganzagos - he 's a painter . We 've got other things . What are you interested in ? Paintings or sculpture ? - Is this your gallery ? - Yes , it is . Then you 're Miss Ferguson ? I mean , this is the Ferguson Gallery , so I guess you 're Miss Ferguson , right ? Well , Mrs Ferguson really , but not really . I was married to Mr Ferguson , Mr Harold Ferguson . But Mr Ferguson and I no longer share bed and board , so whereas I 'm still Geraldine Ferguson , I 'm no longer Mrs Ferguson . I do n't even know what my name is . Call me Gerry . - What 's your name ? - Arthur Stokes . - Are you a cop , Arthur ? - No . What gave you that idea ? You 're careful , like a cop . Right there . I did n't think it showed . My husband was in the diamond business and he had a carry permit . So when your husband carries a gun , you get used to the way it looks . Why do you carry a gun , Arthur ? Are you in the diamond business ? - No , I 'm in the insurance business . - Oh , do insurance men wear guns ? - I did n't know that . - Yeah . If they 're insurance investigators . Do n't tell me - someone had a painting stolen and you 're here to check on authenticity ? No . Well , not exactly . I think you 're a cop , Arthur . I really do . Now , why would a cop be visiting you , Miss Ferguson ? Gerry . Maybe because I charge such exorbitant prices . I do n't really . Yes , I do really . Would you like to look at some pictures while you decide if you 're a cop ? Over here . What kind of a painting was it ? It 's not a painting . It 's a photograph . Then it could have never been here . We never had a photographic show . It 's not even a whole photograph . - Yo-ho . What happened to the other guy ? - What other guy ? The guy that 's been here three or four thousand times in the past few months . He 's about yay tall , no neck , lots of muscle . Looks like the guy that played in Rocky . He told me his name was Al Randolph the first time he came in . Then he forgot what he told me and said he was Al Reinhart the second time . - Is he a cop too ? - Neither of us are cops . - Mr Stark . - Stokes . Just checking . Mr Stokes . - Arthur . - Arthur . I do n't have what you 're looking for . - The price can be made right . - How right is right ? - Do you have it ? - No . I 'm sorry , I do n't . Yes , she does . Khan . Bramley Khan . How do you do ? Bram , you 're a pain in the ass . Arthur Stokes . Pleased to meet you . Well , if we 're going to talk business , I suggest we go into the office . Shall we ? How much are you willing to pay for it , Mr Stokes ? - Oh , that depends . - On what ? On whether or not it 's a piece you already have ? You do have a piece , do n't you ? Or several pieces ? - Is it for sale or not ? - No . How many pieces do you have , Mr Stokes ? Do you know what the picture is supposed to reveal ? - My client ... - Your client my ass ! You 're a cop ! - Miss Ferguson knows about cops . Keep your mouth shut , Bram . Miss Ferguson 's sister is Ginny D'Amore . Her husband was a cheap gangster named Leo D'Amore . He was killed some six years ago following a bank hold-up . Well , I do n't keep track of such things . I just bet you do n't . He 's a cop , Bram . And you 're a fool . Look , you and your partner seem to have some differences . Why do n't you ring me when you get it settled ? Where can you be reached ? I 'm at the Vincent Arms . That 's a fleabag over on North Farm . Are you an out-of-towner , Mr Stokes ? Room 502 . - You did n't answer my question . - You did n't answer any of mine either . I hope you reconsider , Miss Ferguson . Mr Krutch , Lieutenant Columbo . - Well , this is a pleasant surprise . - We decided to take the investigation . - What do you mean ? We made contact with Weinberg . He has another piece and gave me a copy of it . Fantastic . When do I get to have a look at it ? Not tonight . We 'll set a time , maybe tomorrow . Good , fine . Where can I get a hold of you if I need to ? I 'm only three blocks from Weinberg . I 'm staying at the Vincent Arms , room 502 . Let me jot this down . Vincent Arms , room 502 . We 're off to a good start . I ca n't tell you how much I appreciate this . We all stand to gain . I got ta get off the phone , I 'm expecting a call . - Oh , you got another lead ? - Yes . The Geraldine on your list , that 's a Geraldine Ferguson . And her sister was married to one of the guys in the bank hold-up . Leo D'Amore . Has she got anything ? I think so , that 's what I 'm waiting to hear . - Well , will you let me know ? - As soon as anything gels . Good . Thanks again for calling . This is great news . Really . Right . So long . - Yeah ? - Desk clerk , Mr Stokes . I 'm coming . What is it ? Lady left a message , said to bring it up . Lieutenant ? - I 'm OK . - The hell you are . - No , I 'm OK . - I 'm gon na get a meat wagon over here . - I hate hospitals . - How do you like comas ? I 'm not in a coma . Look , I just want to get some ice for that lump . Man , that 's some lump . Jeez , I came ... came to . I got ... I got this towel . I must have passed out again . - Room service is closed . - Well , open it . This is the police . Did you see who did it ? I saw him , but he had his face covered . - You 're lucky he left you alive . - Why would n't he ? He was n't after me . He was after the picture . - Who do you think it was ? - My partner , Mo Weinberg . How do you know it was him ? I do n't know for sure , but I had him on the phone this afternoon . - He knew I was here . - Who else did you talk to ? - Irving Krutch . - Well , it could have been Krutch . It could have been Krutch . But my money is on Mo . - How 's your head ? - Terrible . - I think I 'd better get a meat wagon . - No , you do n't . I got ta go see Mo Weinberg . Just shut up . I need a phone . I have to call the officer who brought me here . The doctor 's instructions are no phone calls . I can take a message . We 're in the middle of a homicide investigation . And we do n't want you to be a victim . Concussion can lead to internal haemorrhage . I do n't think you understand , this is very serious . My partner could be in danger . I need a phone or I have to leave . I do n't think you understand , Lieutenant . The doctor left strict orders . You 're to remain here until he can see you again tomorrow . You need absolute rest . What I need is to get out of here . No , you do n't , big boy . Not without these . - What are you doing ? - You 're not leaving . - Well , then get me a phone . - No calls in or out . He 's asleep , the same as everybody else around here . - Hello . - I ca n't talk loud , it 's not my phone . Uh-oh . Arty , I got ta be quiet . You talk . - I 'm here with Weinberg . - Oh , yeah ? So what did he say ? - Nothing , he 's dead . - He what ? - He 's got a big hole in him , he 's dead . - Dead ? Oh , my God . Dead ? We got ta get over to Krutch 's right away . I 'll need a pair of pants . I 'm sorry , sir . I 'll be done in one moment . - You wan na go to Krutch 's ? - You get over here . I want to go over there immediately , and bring a pair of pants . I did n't get that last part . Pants . Pants , pants - something to wear . Otherwise I ca n't get out of here . Everything 's fine . Go back to sleep . Harry , you all right ? Say something , Harry . - Good night . - Night . Sergeant Arthur Brown , Mr Krutch . Mr Krutch . - What 's the matter ? - Just a few questions . - At three in the morning ? - We 're both awake . - I was n't a minute ago . Besides ... - This wo n't take long , Mr Krutch . Lieutenant Columbo , I did n't see you . Come on in . What 's up ? You and I spoke on the phone around four o'clock this afternoon ? Yes , we did . Why ? Where did you go after the conversation ? - Nowhere . - You stayed here ? Anybody with you ? - Yes . A friend of mine . - Male or female ? - A girl . - What time did she leave ? - We left together , went to dinner . - Where did you go ? The Ram 's Head , the top of 777 Jefferson . Where did you go after that ? For a walk . We looked through all the shop windows on Hall Avenue . - What time did you get home ? - About midnight . - Alone ? - No . - The girl came back with you ? - Yes . So she was with you between what time and what time ? She got here earlier this afternoon . I do n't know . She was definitely here when you called . She 's still here . - Where ? - In bed . - Get her up . - Why ? One man 's been assaulted , another one 's been killed . I want her to tell me where you were when this was happening . Is that OK with you ? - Who was killed ? - You know who was assaulted ? - No . No , I don't . - Why did you only ask who was killed ? Are n't you interested in who was beaten up ? Of course . Let me get her . He wants to ... I 'll ask her . - What 's your name , miss ? - Suzie . - Suzie what ? - Suzie Endicott . Miss Endicott , what time did you get here today ? - About 1:00 , was n't it ? 12:30 , 1:00 ? - About then . What time did you go out to dinner ? About 7:00 , 7:30 . - Where did you eat ? - The Ram 's Head . Where did you go after that ? We walked for a little bit and then we came back here . What time was that ? I guess we got back here about 11 . - Have you been here since ? - Mm-hm . Miss Endicott , did Mr Krutch leave you any time between 1:00 and now ? Yeah . When he went to the men 's room at the restaurant . - Happy now ? - Overjoyed . Mr Krutch , are you familiar with timetables ? - What do you mean ? Train timetables ? - No , investigating timetables . What happened to your head ? I fell off a ladder . - I 'm sorry to hear that . - I want you to draw me up a timetable . I want you to list everything you did , and the exact time that you did it . From 1 pm to right this minute . We 'll wait . Hey ! Hey ! What are you doing ? ! Come on ! - Come on ! - Read the sign . I just put it there 30 minutes ago ! Come on ! 15 minutes ago , I just put it there . Ten minutes ago ! You bloodsucking witch ! - Lieutenant . - Did you find anything ? Nothing . Whoever killed Weinberg got his pieces of photograph . Or Weinberg stashed them someplace else , because I 've been through everything and there 's nothing here . So whoever did it got two pieces ? Weinberg 's and the copy of the piece I gave Weinberg . - I got your pants . No . Hey , Lieutenant . We got your Mafia costume . What do we do with it ? Uh , pull over there and I 'll change in the car . Come on down , we can talk . I 'm gon na change in the car . That 's important . Let me write that down . Weinberg 's time of death was 5:30pm Saturday afternoon . And there were two witnesses and they each heard two shots . And the medical examiner , he said the time of death was also approximately 5:30pm , right ? - Right . - OK . Oh , McKittrick . In this jacket , you 'll find Krutch 's timetable with his whereabouts yesterday . Check it out and get back to me . - Where 's the pants to this outfit ? - They 're there . - I do n't see ' em . - Maybe they 're in the bag . Stay there . There 's a lady coming . - Detective Brown . - Yeah . - Can that be arranged ? - I think so . There might be a safe in there . Be nice to know what 's inside . Anything you can do would be appreciated . I 'll do my best , sir . And what do you plan to do now that you 're wearing that expensive suit ? Today is Sunday , so I 'll go to church . Signora , c ' ? un signore qui chi vuole parlare con lei . - Questo signore qua ? - Eccolo . Scusi , signora . I would like to offer my belated condolences on the death of your sister . You knew my sister Mary ? Not personally , but I knew her husband . He was a good friend . We did business together . Oh , you worked with Anthony ? Nice . - What 's your name ? - Columbo . La famiglia Columbo ? I 'm honoured to meet you . Can I offer you a ride ? Excuse me . - I know very little . - But you know about the full picture . That 's where they hid the treasure . Ma che tesoro ? What treasure ? Maybe I do n't understand . Did n't you tell the insurance man about a treasure ? No . When you gave him the piece of the picture and that list of names . Ma che lista ? I gave him a piece of a picture and he still has to pay me the money he promised . - You never gave him a list of names ? - No . Never . Thank you very much . Arrivederci . Buona fortuna . Signora , did anyone else show an interest in that picture ? Oh , yes . That Ferguson woman . Geraldine . Geraldine Ferguson . Through her messenger , Signore Khan . I could n't do business with her . Was a shame for the family . You 've been very helpful . Thank you again . Senta . Maybe you can help me . Maybe you can , I do n't know , force that man to pay me the money he owes me . Times are not easy , you know . I see what I can do . - Oh , hell . - That 's right , here come the cops . He 's admitting it . Come in . I admire an honest man . - Drink ? Or is it too early ? - It 's nearly two o'clock . - Name it . - I 'd rather keep a clear head . OK , keep a clear head . I 'll have one , though , if you do n't mind . I find Sundays very boring . After I 've read Geoffrey Levin and the comics , there 's nothing exciting left . Who 's Geoffrey Levin ? - Arthur . - You sure you 're not a mental patient ? - Pretty sure . Yesterday you were an insurance investigator . That was for your benefit . Today I had to visit the sister-in-law of a dead mob boss . Tony " the Nose " Bonamico . - Did he have a big nose ? - Yes , he did . He also had a girlfriend named Gerry Ferguson . - Arthur . - Yes ? That 's a nasty-looking bump on your head . - Yes , it is . - Does it hurt ? - A bit . - It 's awful-looking . Sit down . - What for ? - I 'm going to make you feel better . - I do n't think you ... - That 's right , do n't think . Sit there , stretch out your legs , relax , close your eyes . - Miss Ferguson . - Gerry . - Someone was murdered last night . Mean anything to you ? No . - What 's your real name ? - Lieutenant Columbo . - Your first name . - Lieutenant . - You 're putting me on . - On Wednesday ... - How did we get back to Wednesday ? - I took us back there . On Wednesday night , two men killed each other in a brawl . - Who ? - That 's not important . What is important is one of ' em had a piece of a photograph . Are we gon na start that again ? I already told you . We have reason to believe the fragment in the dead man 's hand was part of a larger picture showing the location of $4 million stolen from the bank six years ago . We also believe that you have another piece of that picture . And we want it . It 's as simple as that . Whoever has a piece is in danger . For your own safety ... - Bullshit . - I beg your pardon ? The day the cops start worrying about anybody 's safety is the day ... I think we 'd better head downtown . Wan na get dressed ? No , I do n't . What 'll the charge be ? Drinking in my pyjamas ? Miss Ferguson , I 'm conducting a murder investigation . OK , OK , OK . Stop spouting legalities . Sit down . I 'd rather talk here than in some stuffy old squad room . - Do you have a piece of the photograph ? - Yes . - Where did you get it ? - My brother-in-law . - Leo D'Amore ? - Yes . - When ? - Just before the hold-up . - What did he say about it ? - That I should hold onto it . - Why you and not your sister ? - My sister 's a ditz , always was . - Leo knew who the smart one was . - I do n't know anything about a list . - That 's a lie . I 've never seen it . You 're lying . We know your partner has it . Where did he get it ? I do n't know anything about it . What 's it supposed to be ? Forget it . Where 's your piece of the shot ? In the gallery safe . - Will you turn it over to me ? - No . - I thought you said ... - I said I 'd answer your questions . But the piece of photograph is my private property and I 'll do with it what I wish . - Thank you for your time . - So where are you going ? I 'm gon na try and find the person that murdered Mo Weinberg . Well , be careful . Lots of people with guns out there . - I 'll be seeing you again . - Sunday afternoons . Any other time , I 'm busy . I got your clothes . Wan na change now ? No , not this minute . Where 's Brown ? - Right there . - We got the blow-ups . Oh , good . That 's good . Jeff , move out . Let Ernie out . And bring my clothes . Hey , Zeke . Good to see you . I 've been waiting here for half an hour . I know you have . Give me a minute with the boys and I 'll be right with you . Have something on me while you wait . - Appreciate that . - Bill , give Mr Rivers a glass of water . The water here is outstanding . - I ca n't thank you enough . - My pleasure . Lieutenant , this is a blow-up of the torn list of names we got from Krutch . This is a blow-up of the list of names I took from Bramley Khan 's cash box . And this is a blow-up of the two pieces of paper put together ... just talking out loud , the first four names on that list ... Weinberg , Dillinger , Ehrbach and Mary Bonamico - they 're all dead . And we have copies of Weinberg 's piece , of Dillinger 's piece , which we found in Ehrbach 's dead hand . Ehrbach 's piece , which we found in the light bulb socket . And Mary Bonamico 's piece , which we got from Krutch . And the fifth name on the list ... Geraldine Ferguson - just admitted she has another piece . And her piece is in her gallery in the safe . That 's the first thing we got ta do Monday - get a judge , warrant , and look at that safe . Regarding the sixth and seventh name on the list . Dorthea McNally and Derrick Combs . Now , we have gone over the directories for the entire Los Angeles area . There are two Derrick Combs . One in Riverside and one in Inglewood . Now , there are 64 McNallys , none of them named Dorthea . On 6th Street , off Skid Row . Now , how do you wan na hit them ? If I can make a suggestion . We have your clothes here . And I think you 'd fit in nicely with the folks at Skid Row . Maybe you should take McNally . Sounds right . What do you think ? Sounds right . I 'll go after the two Derrick Combs . Fine . And we 'll meet at the squad room at six o'clock and we 'll see where we 're at . Lieutenant , we 're almost finished checking out Krutch 's timetable . So far , it 's rock solid . Everything checks . Irving Krutch . Zeke , still here ? Still here . Mr Rivers . What do you know about the parking on Kirby Street in downtown Los Angeles ? Know more about it than any man alive . Good . Let 's talk . What 's going on over there ? Will you two shut up ? - Yes ? - Miss McNally ? - I do n't take drunks . - Seriously . Let me show you my badge . Well , I ai n't hooking any more . I know that . That 's why you just told me to go away . That 's right . That 's why I told you that . That 's why you told me that . Here 's the badge . Your name Dorthea ? Did you know a Detective MacAvenie ? - MacAvenie ? - He was in homicide . MacAvenie ? MacAvenie ? I have this guy ... - What was his first name ? - Pat . Did he have a son on the force ? No . A brother . That 's him . I know him . I know the brother too . Oh , Pat . Pat was ... He was one hell of a cop . Did you know him ? Did I know him ? He was a lot of fun , was n't he ? You 'll never know . So are you gon na leave me in the corridor or invite me in to have a drink ? Well ... I 'm mad at him . - Well , he 's been sick . - Good . Next time you run into him , tell him to smarten up . I 'll do that . I notice you got a D in front of your name by the mailbox . That 's right . I put D instead of Dorthea so that men wo n't come round and bother me any more . Oh , that 's a good idea . OK , Dorthea . Dorthea , do you mind if I ask you about a photograph ? Huh ? A photograph . Do you mind if I ask you about it ? Oh , man . You guys . You sure know how to bring up ancient history . I must have posed for those pictures 20 years ago . I was some little cookie in those days . - I 'm not talking about a girly picture ... You 're jumping around real fast now . What do you remember about that hold-up ? Look , I have your word , you 're not gon na make any trouble ? You got it . My nephew was one of the guys that pulled that job . - What was his name ? - Petey Ryan . He 's dead now . They all got killed on that job . - Some bank robbers . - What about the picture ? What picture ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . A piece of a snapshot your nephew might have given you before he pulled the job . Jeez , it was six years ago . Try and remember . - I do n't even remember where I lived . - You can remember . Think . I think better when I 'm drinking . Have you got something in the house ? Yeah , but that 's my insurance , you know . And if I remember about the picture ? - What about it ? - What 's it worth to you ? Two more 20s . Look , you 're taking up an awful lot of my time here . - Make it three more 20s . - You got a deal . You want some of this piss ? Makes you go blind , I understand . No , thanks . Here 's looking out for your whole family . This is poison . Absolute poison . I do n't remember any snapshot . You can remember . Think . I am thinking . Just shut up . My nephew , he was in and out all the time . - Who remembers ? - Where do you keep your valuables ? - What valuables ? - Important papers . Your birth certificate , your social security card . Social security card . I might have that . Where the hell is that ? My sister dropped something off . Do you remember a fighter , Tiger Willis ? - Willis ? No . He got killed in the ring . Kid from Buenos Aires killed him . I was ringside . Bobby . That was his real name . Bobby Willis . That " Tiger " crap , that was just for the ring . Bobby always got me ringside . Here 's that thing my sister dropped off . There 's not much here . I do n't like memories . That 's all there is . I 'm looking for something small . Do you mind if I dump this out ? Go ahead . Careful . Careful with that . - Is that what you want ? - That 's what I want . Looks like Donald Duck . What ? Holy jamolies ! What ? " For D McNally . I 'm in a hospital . I 'm very sick . " " Mikey said to send you this if it ever looked like I was checking out . " " Well , I 'm checking out . Derrick Combs . - That 's 60 bucks you owe me , cookie . - Baby , you got it . All right , fellas . Here 's the four pieces we had at the beginning of the day . Here 's Krutch 's piece - that 's a corner piece . Weinberg 's piece , another corner piece . Ehrbach 's piece . That 's our light bulb piece which fits into Weinberg 's piece . Dillinger 's piece . There 's the belly dancer , which fits into Ehrbach 's piece . And here , courtesy of Dorthea McNally , bless her heart , is what we have at the end of the day . Keep your fingers crossed . Donald Duck . Yes . Yes , that fits very nicely between Ehrbach and Krutch . And Derrick Combs ' piece , it 's another corner piece . That inserts beautifully between Weinberg 's and Ehrbach 's . So now , what do we have ? Nothing . Nothing . You ca n't tell what in the hell it is . Well , fellas , look at it this way . Mikey Ryan had two pieces . That 's the two I got from Dorthea McNally . My guess is each bank robber had two . That 's a total of eight . We got six . And tomorrow , when we get the warrant to search Ferguson 's safe , we 're gon na have seven . - One more to go ? - That 's my guess . And if there 's a lord above , then we 'll know where the money is . Let 's get some sleep . Oh , Lieutenant . Regarding Krutch 's timetable , everything fits . Every moment is accounted for . Mr Krutch has an airtight alibi . Mr Irving Krutch . Zeke , you still here ? - Still here . - Be with you in a minute . Been here 20 minutes . Without water . - How you doing ? - About 60% done . - You find anything ? - Not a thing . - Both sides of the street ? - Both sides . - What 's the rush ? - Once we get that warrant , we 're close , and that 's going to be early tomorrow . You 're the boss . - When does the gallery open ? - 9:30 . Perfect . I ca n't wait to see that seventh piece . - You got the warrant ? - Yeah , right here . Yesterday , she said the piece was in the safe . Keep your fingers crossed . Lieutenant . Oh , my God . You all right ? What happened ? I must have fainted . All right . You 'll be OK . - She 's dead . - What ? Dead . - What about the list ? - What list ? The list of names of the people who had pieces of the photograph . I do n't know what you 're talking about . You never heard of Derrick Combs ? - No . - You never heard of Dorthea McNally ? No . Open this . - How did you know ? - Never mind . He was very sick . He had no interest in my offer . Did you try to get Dorthea McNally 's piece ? I was in her place , but I could n't find anything . Did you break into Mo Weinberg 's place ? I never heard of him . Do n't you read the newspapers ? Oh , you mean about his murder ? Yes , of course I read about his murder . I thought you were referring to my knowing him before that . - Did you kill Mo Weinberg ? - No , I did not , Mr Brown . Before the night of his murder , I did n't know he existed . Even though he was in the gallery several times to inquire about the photograph ? - Yes , but always using an assumed name . - Did you beat me up ? - I should say not ! - Where were you at the time ? - Home , in bed ! - When ? - The night you got beat up . - Who told Gerry ? - You , I would guess . - I never told her anything . Well , then , she must have known some other way . Maybe she was involved and hired someone to go to your hotel . - How do you know where it happened ? - She told me . - She said two men attacked me ? - Yes , she told me the next day . She could n't have said two men , because I just made that up . - Did you go after Weinberg after ? - No ! - You walked three blocks to his room ! - No ! - You killed him , admit it ! - You attacked me ! Yes ! No ! Yes ! Yes or no ? Yes or no , Mr Khan ? I ... I never intended to hit you . I simply wanted to force you to give me the piece that you had . And then , when you opened the door , I panicked , and I ... Book him . First-degree assault . Before you do that ... Whoever killed Gerry did n't get her piece . That safe 's been opened and it 's empty . It was n't in the safe . Look , I do n't want to go to jail . I know where Gerry 's piece is . Can you help me ? We can talk about it when I get the piece . Excuse me . Voil ? . This is a key piece . Assault three - 30 days . This is a key piece because of this car . We know this is a road , and this furry stuff , that 's water . This photograph was taken from above . That 's why there 's no sky . We still do n't know where the money is . Maybe the eighth piece has the X on it . What 's he questioning Krutch about ? My guess - my guess because he does n't tell me anything ... my guess is the killings . But Krutch has airtight alibis . The old bag 's lying , it 's as simple as that . - But maybe you are . - Why should I be ? For God 's sake , I came to you with all this stuff . I 'm as anxious to locate the money as you are . OK , I 'll ask you again . Why would a nice old Italian lady , who incidentally , is waiting for you to fork over 1,000 bucks ... I 'll pay her . Do n't worry . Krutch does n't welsh . Why would this nice old Italian lady deny having told you anything about a treasure or a list of names ? I do n't know . Go ask her , I 'm telling you . She gave me the list , the photograph , and all the information tying it together . She says she only gave you a piece of the picture . She 's a liar . Sicilians are liars . - OK . Oh , boy . Now , why would you wan na know that ? Because maybe you decided to take another look around the gallery , the way you looked around a few other people 's places . No . No , you have got the wrong customer . OK . So where were you ? I was in bed with Susan Endicott . Always in bed with Susan Endicott . - Hey , would n't you be ? - And , of course , she 'll verify this ? Go ask her , I 've got nothing to hide . Let 's do that . - What ? She 's here ? - Come on . I 'm here , Lieutenant . Been waiting 20 minutes . - Be with you in a bit . - Is that our man ? - Yeah . - What does he mean by that ? I do n't know . I just say yes . - Look what I got for tonight . - Tammy Wynette . Great . - And they 're front row . - Susan . Would you mind telling me where you were last night ? Sunday night . - At the movies . - Alone ? No , with Irving . And where did you go after the movies ? - Back to Irv 's place . - Do you have your own apartment ? Yes , but on weekends I usually like to sleep over at Irv 's . What time did you get back ? About 10:30 . - And then what did you do ? - We watched TV . And what did you do after you watched TV ? - We made love . - And then ? We went to sleep . And neither of you left the apartment between 11:30 and 3am ? No . I told you . First we watched TV and then we made love and then we went to sleep . And Mr Krutch never left the apartment ? No . These things take time , you know . And Mr Krutch never left the apartment ? No . - Did he leave the bedroom ? - No . Oh , well , once . To get me fresh orange juice . Officer Brown . Mr Rivers , Miss Susan Endicott . Mr Rivers , Mr Irving Krutch . I 'd like to talk to Susan alone , so if you do n't mind ... - I do mind . I do n't want ... - That 's all right . Do n't worry about me . Things will be quicker this way . - See you soon . - Yeah . You got any more of those black Crows ? - Help yourself . - Oh , they 're not for me . Mr Rivers here , he 's partial to black Crows . - I ca n't thank you enough . - It is my pleasure . Miss Endicott , you just told us about Sunday . Now let 's go back to Saturday . Is that accurate ? Yes . And you said that during that entire time , Mr Krutch never left the apartment . - Is that a fact ? - Yes . This is a parking meter . Mr Rivers , would you show Miss Endicott the photograph ? As you can see , ma'am , that meter , which is this meter , is located in front of a rooming house at 220 South Kirby . Can you see that , ma'am ? Zeke , would you now show the young lady what you 've got in the bag ? Before I forget , here 's a copy of Mr Krutch 's gun permit that you asked for . Yeah , but this gun has no bearing on our murder ? No . The murder weapon was a.32 Smith Wesson . Just for your edification , Miss Endicott , a man named Mo Weinberg was shot to death at 5:30pm on Saturday . Bear in mind that this murder took place at 5:30pm Saturday . We have two witnesses who will testify to hearing two shots at that time . Miss Endicott , that meter was emptied of all coins on Saturday afternoon at one o'clock . That 's these coins . They do n't mean nothing . Forget about them . The coins on the table were inserted into the machine sometime between 1 pm and 6pm on Saturday . No coins came in after six , because after six the parking is free . All Saturday night and Sunday . And these coins were taken out of the machine early Sunday morning . So we know that the coins that you 're looking at were inserted into the machine sometime between 1 pm and 6pm on Saturday . Now , this particular coin , the one in my hand ... A fingerprint that matches Mr Krutch 's fingerprint on this gun permit . So we know that Mr Krutch left the apartment sometime on Saturday , because we know that sometime between 1 and 6pm , he put this coin in that machine at 220 South Kirby Street . You wan na think about your story ? Mr Krutch is gon na be arrested - suspicion of murder . You stick to your story , you 're gon na be arrested - accessory to murder . Did Mr Krutch leave his apartment at any time on Saturday ? Yes , he left right after you called at four o'clock . - And what time did he come back ? - 6:30 . Did Mr Krutch leave his apartment at any time Sunday night ? Yes , he left at 12 midnight and did n't come back until three . Grazie . That rotten bitch . That rotten witch . And I do n't mean Susan . - Who ? - Mary Bonamico . - This is the eighth piece . - That 's right . I paid her $40,000 . She gave me the piece I originally gave you . - This piece ? - Yes . And half the list of names . - Half the list ? This half ? - That 's right . That half . - But that piece . - The eighth piece . That she held back . I did n't know that existed till a couple of months ago . When she died . I got it from her sister . And naturally , you did n't give it to us . Naturally . It showed the exact location of the money , do you think I 'm an idiot ? Why did you kill Weinberg ? Because he had another piece and I wanted it . We were running a race . I knew I was ahead cos I had the piece with the X on it . But suppose you got cute and you did n't wan na show me anything else . Weinberg 's piece , that was insurance . I came so close to putting this all together . You guys helped me more than you realise . I came this close . Close ... but no cigar . Right , lift it up . Take it easy . Careful . Hey , easy . - Hey , there she blows ! - Do we know if there 's anything in it ? We 'll know in a minute , Lieutenant . This is it ! This is it ! It is all green ! Four million schmolies ! - Lieutenant , you do n't wan na see it ? - No , I saw enough of this case . Where are you going ? I 'm going to take my dog to the park . Toodle-oo . - " Toodle-oo " ? What ? - I do n't know . 
@@5227341 Previously on The West Wing : Okay . Let 's go win this thing . Why is Greg Brock of the Times on your call log five times a week in the months before he published his leak story ? - You think the leak came from me . - You need to stop the investigation . - Excuse me ? - The evidence thus far suggests the leak came from the White House . We 're getting movement from Congress on education . - That 's the Santos plan . - Probably does n't have the votes ... - He definitely doesn't . ... but if he 's interested ... He 's interested because the Vinick camp told him to . - Could be . - Haffley 's playing you . No , actually he 's screwing you and for the moment we are comfortable with that . Scheduling and Advance is thinking little flags for Monday 's bill signing . - Little flags ? - American ones . We 've stopped using the skull and crossbones ? They wan na line the table with a big row of ... - Little flags ... Something a little more specific than a great big row of ... - Little flags . - Thank you . Little fish . - There 's a secret military shuttle , that that 's the only way to have repaired the space station ' s laboratory module . But with Brock refusing to answer grand-jury questions on his source for the top ... NASA announced the astronauts fixed the shuttle by themselves . - Anybody buying it ? - Not so much . We 've got a congressional committee investigating a national-security leak . Washington 's devolving into another gavel-splitting , nose-thumbing standstill . Not to mention the fact that a fisheries bill could be my legacy as chief of staff . - What 's this ? White House Counsel wants to put out a statement . - We worked out the language in the car . - " Respect for the paw " ? - " Law . " Respect for the law . - You think this is a good idea ? The White House Counsel wants it out . You do n't think Vinick will stomp all over this ? I think the president and White House Counsel want it out . Now , if you don ' t think I have a personal stake in my economic plan if you don ' t think it 's personal for me hey , if the country does n't like it , I 'll be the first one unemployed . We ca n't hang on to the jobs of the past , none of us can . The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years . A child that is born tonight could live to see the 22nd century . If we nourish innovation , if we tear down red tape and regulation that child could lead a brand-new industry can cure a dreaded disease can touch a far horizon that we ca n't even glimpse yet . Start by noon , the affiliates will carry ... Let 's start it by noon . Secret Service would prefer it if you did n't wade into the crowd . Tell them , put 40 electoral votes on the table , I 'll do whatever they want . How you doing there ? Thank you so much for coming . Hi , how are you ? Good to see you . Thanks so much for coming out . Popular Mechanics , 1949 . I 'm not making this up . They predicted : " In the future , computers will weigh no more than 1 and a half tons . " So if you think my plan for high-tech jobs is a little light , then ... Anybody got any questions ? - Hey , you here all night again ? - I thought you left at 10:30 . I came back when I saw the coverage of yesterday 's West Coast swing . Our economic message is working , so I 'm revamping the plan . We would have helped . Tell Speechwriting to try a version that wins votes . And tell Advance I 'm canceling the foreign-policy reporters ' meeting and adding a town hall when he gets to Tampa . - What are those ? - People think campaigns are about two competing answers to the same question . They 're not . They 're a fight over the question itself . Now , Vinick is opening up a big lead on security issues . - That 's box one . - So we need to do more military . No , if the race is about that , we lose . But we 're way ahead on most domestic issues . This new economic message could be our ticket . We keep the conversation in box number two , we win this thing . - What 's box three ? - Trivia . Ephemera , stuff we ca n't control . From today on , every speech , every public event , box number two . - You do this on Bartlet 's campaigns ? - Toby Ziegler . No , they 're trying to damp that story down . Tell it to CNN . Operator , get me Toby Ziegler , now . - Yeah . - Whatever you 're announcing tell me you 're gon na damp down this leak story ... We 're stopping our investigation to cooperate with Congress . Democrats do n't care if there are felons in the Sit Room . Santos is gon na get tarred with ... - saying the White House will halt its efforts to find the leaker . Bad news for Matt Santos , who just got the spotlight ... So a national-security leak , is that in box number three ? - The economy . They add serious lapses in national security . Santos has been trailing his opponent , Republican Senator Arnold Vinick ... Keep him away from the press . No . No talking to the press till we hear what Vinick says . - We should have somebody with him . - Bram 's with him . - A senior adviser , to handle things . - I 'm flying out this afternoon . - Josh ? Senator ! The president 's shutting his investigation of the security leak . Do you think there 's a legal basis ? If that were my White House , I 'd seal the doors and windows until we found that leaker . And then I 'd throw him in federal prison . Vinick 's public schedule . I need his schedule for the day . - Josh . - Is that the congressman ? What are they smoking in that White House of yours ? First they bogart my education plan for some congressional compromise then they serve up a big fat pitch for switch-hitter Vinick . It 's a legal strategy . We 've got ta avoid commenting or it 'll swamp our message . I have to make a statement . It 's all the press will wan na talk about . Any comment drags us into a bad story , miles off our economic message . I 'm having lunch with two dozen foreign-policy reporters today . And I 'm making it a reverse town hall . You ask people their personal stories . No one gets to ask you unscripted questions . He can handle tough questions . You should see him out here . All this attention on the leak story it 's magnifying the inevitable mommy problem . - Mommy problem ? - When voters want a national daddy someone tough and strong , they vote Republican . When they want a mommy to give them jobs , health care policy equivalent of matzo-ball soup , they vote Democratic . On domestic issues , we 're three points up . We 're better than Vinick on military . The congressman was a Marine pilot flying in the Gulf . Vinick never even served . Democrats do n't beat Republicans on security issues . I know it 's frustrating , but we have to stay in the box that we can win . That 's why Vinick attacked Bartlet . To force us back on security . One sentence and he boxes me into a corner , does n't even mention my name . We got ta get to this crowd event . We 'll see you in Tampa . - Thank you . - Thank you , sir . And having made the essential repairs to the space station ' s laboratory module NASA now expects the astronauts to return home within the next four to five days . It 's Josh again . I told him to call Toby . He insisted on talking to you . Find Toby , will you ? For the love of my sanity , talk to Toby . He 's my liaison to the campaign ... How could you let the president do this when I find a message that works ? - It was a legal decision . You work in the most politicized square footage in the country . You turned this over to the Republicans , who are gon na kill me with paper cuts leak every incriminating detail when it pleases them and I never get back to my issues . Call for a special prosecutor ! You 're shutting down your investigation ? Go all the way . Take it out of the political arena for good . While you 're at it , find me a campaign liaison who 's not out to screw me . A prosecutor rifling through every can of trash from the past seven years ? Glad we have this chance to chat . The last one was so gratifying . I am begging you , get the politics out of this . You 're putting politics in it . You deal away my education plan . You don ' t give me a heads up on political tsunamis . I am the only thing between Matt Santos and the megaphone through which he is going to trash his own party 's White House . Skip Kentucky . We 'll hit it through Cincinnati media . Move this photo above the fold . Every time we talk about gun control we have to say we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen right up front . Tell them no , not everything 's a conspiracy . But you changed to a reverse town hall because ... ? Certain things are conspiracies . - I need sexier economic policy . - Sexier . The press wants to write about the leak . We want the economy . - Let 's show a little leg . - By " leg , " you mean ... ? Targeted tax credits , preferably indexed to inflation . - When did you last go on a date ? - I do n't wan na talk about it . The Democratic media consultants are waiting . Okay , I 'm running a national campaign here . - By yourself ? - Joey , 12 days ago we were going on unemployment . We barely got the nomination . We spent the last four days arguing with the press over Leo 's cholesterol level . I delegate . - Name one thing you 've delegated . - I would n't have chosen this color . You have to hire some heavyweights . Bruno Gianelli . You do n't even have a communications director . There 's that huge empty office next to yours . Hi , I 'm Bill . They told me to show up after 10 . Absolutely . Welcome . You can follow me . There must be 300 people on staff . Surely a few of them are capable ... Not a single one of these non-shavers would challenge my assumptions stand up to me in a meeting ... - We thought we 'd try it with crime ... - Just do it the way I asked , okay ? I mean , this is n't summer camp . We 're not making tie racks out of plywood . Not everyone has the savvy to play the big game . This is your desk . Sit with Personnel . Diana will give you business cards . Policy working group starts at 3 . And that 's when I install the new phone lines ? - Front desk . Around the corner . - Thanks for the business cards . You bet . If you 're not leaning on your staff , lean on them . These guys just want a slice of the DNC media budget . We slide them a contract so they wo n't snipe at us on Meet the Press . - Here 's the list of attendees . - What 's she doing on there ? You said be sure to invite Louise Thornton . I said be sure not to invite her . Thank you for coming to this strategy meeting . This is the greatest assemblage of Democratic talent since the last time Jed Bartlet dined alone . As you can see , we 're positioning Santos very strongly on domestic issues , especially the economy . With a little discipline , we can ride out today 's press storm . I want your input on our message and strategy . Your pals in the White House are creating this storm . They 're bungling this leak investigation . My Senate clients are nervous . - Mine too . - Very nervous . - Got ta repackage him . - Make him a moderate . We think when the voters see his record on deficit reduction and middle-class ... I do n't see why Santos is n't sticking it to Vinick with strong contrasts . - He should knife him . - With contrasts . We did n't have a full convention to define ourselves . We 're trying to run a positive campaign especially while the voters are learning about us . - Now , if you will look at the handout ... - You do n't really want our input . Everybody 's here for a piece of the media budget . So get to the point , please . It goes without saying that you will each be part of the DNC media buy as you can see on page two . - We 've got a strong story for voters . - We 're excited about the buy . She means that we can test some dynamic new spots . Yeah , that 'd really fill in the picture . I 'm not talking about 10-point plans or McGarry 's love of egg whites . I 'm talking about the iconic . Something you can put on a sticker that tells people who Matt Santos is . Eight days after the convention , I still do n't have a clue . - Where are you going ? - I do n't want a DNC contract . I just came by to see if this was your vanity exercise everyone says it is . Besides , if I take your money , how can I snipe at you on Meet the Press ? She does n't speak for all of us . We have a lot to talk about . If we could get back to the DNC ... Was that page two ? You and I have n't always been on the same side . - My strong suit is n't ... - Is n't connecting with the electorate . ... reducing human complexity to a box of soap flakes , no . All I know about Santos is he 's smart and he 's cute . - That 's hardly the stuff of leadership . - It 's better than fat and dumb . That 's a good bumper sticker . You do n't need me . I think what you do is superficial , but I know it 's important or I would n't be asking you of all people for help . I 'm not a cultist like you . We have different approaches to campaigns . - I win them . - I 'm trying to be friends . You saw Vinick on TV this morning . It was n't about content but he was tough and authentic . He was Neil Young to your Neil Diamond . - I like Neil Diamond . - Sure . We ca n't fight about security . How about moving it to : While Santos was serving in the Gulf , Vinick was serving himself chardonnay ? That Santos is still serving in the reserves . He 's been in the Senate for 90 years . He was born in a hearing . If you 're not using the phrase " Beltway Arnie " ... We 're not going negative , not now , not first . You do n't think you 're running a negative campaign ? Why are you always talking about high-tech jobs ? Vinick uses a manual typewriter and his future 's a set of plastic gums . You 're doing political smear . I 'm saying do it right . - We 're getting lots of calls on this leak . - How many ? - 113 . - We 're not commenting . The Post still thinks today 's lunch was canceled because we 're hiding from the leak . - Tell them we cancel lunches all the time . We 're fast and nimble and move like the night , okay ? Do n't mind me . Hang on . Manifest Lou for the Florida-California trip . - Ten minutes ago you did n't want her ... - Her ideas are nutty . She does n't play well with others , but she 's got an IQ of 200 . She knows this image stuff backwards and it 's better than having her lobbing mortars at me . - See if she wants the vegetarian option . - She 'll have the raw meat . I want you to come with me . You can pick up a bag on the way . If the congressman signs off , I 'm hiring you as director of communications . - I do n't think so . - I 'm talking about the future here . Yes , I do n't have any desire to play in your one-man band . I am asking you to meet with the next president of the United States . State 's about to brief POTUS and VPOTUS on the Norwegian working dinner . - Thank you . Plus , Brock still wants a few minutes . Tell him no . In Norwegian if you have to . That would be " nosk . " What is it ? Counsel 's office says the first round of subpoenas are coming and they start with junior staff . - Okay . Obviously , the focus is on the chief of staff 's office . On our office . - If there 's anything you want me to ... - I want you to tell the truth . Josh , you have a comment about this Bartlet situation ? I got brand-new policy , also known as hard news . Do n't all thank me . The congressman 's not taking questions ? He 's proposing a major new tax credit for research . It rewards innovation in the economy . - When will you make him available ? - After you write about the tax credit . Republicans are saying Democrats ca n't be trusted with national security ... Santos has to be furious at the president . - You have a comment on the Post ? - I 'm against it , off the record . There 's a story on their website that Santos has canceled four lunch events . - Lunch events ? - Yeah , why always lunches ? Let me get this ... They got a story that we 're canceling lunch events ? Four in two weeks . They 're calling it " Santos Siesta . " First , that 's ridiculous . Second , it 's a cheap stereotype . - Why is it always lunches ? - You ca n't be interested in this . As opposed to the same speech we 've written about two days in a row ? - We 'll see you after the event . - You heard about the siesta . When I said to say we cancel lunches , it was n't to emphasize ... We cancel lunches all the time . A fine-line situation . - Not really . - So how do we deal ? We hold lunch events this week . - Does n't this fall into box three ? - I use a message grid , so sue me . That is what happens when you fight scandal with spreadsheets . I 'm running a presidential campaign . You got a better idea ? I 'll take it . Vinick 's slugging you . How about slugging back ? This lunch thing was our goof . You do n't think somebody 's looking for them ? We do n't give them anything else , by the end of the day they 'll file stories about the tax credit . - I 'm not commenting on the leak . - This is n't about the leak . - Do n't tell me there 's another ... - No , this one you 're gon na like . So is this covered in Josh 's press memo ? No , it 's in Josh 's scheduling memo . It 's a listen-only conference call . We 'll do it right after the reverse town hall . I can open it up to hand gestures . Then you 're meeting Lou Thornton , a media strategist Josh wants to hire . Oh , she wins a lot of races . She probably wo n't do it , but she is what we need in Communications . Aggressive , out-of-the-box . Her ideas would be heavily filtered through me . - Anything you can do to get her . - I 'll grab you when they start your intro . So let me guess , the press is going bananas because I have n't been commenting on the leak . I think I have a way to close the security gap overnight . Strafing runs over the National Press Club , huh ? TIME magazine has a copy of a letter from the Marine Reserve command . You 've been called up for reserve training in Fort Worth , Texas , for two days . - The Tuesday after Labor Day . Deck the halls with guns and ammo . This is what we could n't do at the convention : You in fatigues , wind in your hair , trench knife in your teeth . This is an annual required thing , right ? Do a physical , some flight hours , marksmanship ... With very big guns . Guns are very big . - It wo n't look like a stunt ? - Following orders . - They 've started your intro . - Okay . Sir , give me your best bottle of champagne . Make it your 10th best . Nothing with a screw-off top . - Remember me ? - Watch the reverse town hall . They 're doing introductions . Leave so I can talk about stuff you ca n't hear . Sure thing . We 're about to make a big announcement . Two days after Labor Day the congressman 's doing reserve duty in Texas . He 's following orders . We announce it without comment . - Picture 's worth a thousand bayonets . - Fantastic . Work with the congressional office , get documentation . - Documentation . - Lay it out for the press : Dates , details , how he 's done this every year like clockwork . Sometimes he resets the clock . When it needs rewinding , just when it needs ... He 's postponed it a few times . For critical national-security votes in the Congress . Usually to campaign for reelection . I think once because his daughter was sick . - Matthew Santos ! - We 've been getting press inquiries . - Yeah , I 'm sure . A lot of them , on why we ended this internal investigation and how we plan to deal with it ... - Refer them to Counsel 's office . - Which is good ... - Wall this off from the White House so we can do some governing . - Counsel 's not taking questions . - Some walls are thicker than others . - See your call sheet . There are reporters outside your office ... It 's for the right reasons . Men with good reasons should n't set precedents for men with bad ones . - What 's this ? - Witness list for congressional hearings . - What I could get . - Greg Brock will refuse to testify . Think Congress holds him in contempt ? First Amendment is n't what it used to be . - I 've been avoiding him all day . - As you should . So I moved it around a bit . At least I did real reserve training with the big guns every year . Almost . It 'll look like a stunt , wo n't it ? Fourteen weeks before the election , trailing on security you skipped it for politics and Flintstones chewables we announce you 're putting on a uniform the first day of fall campaigning ? It 'll look like Ringling Bros . Barnum Bailey Circus . They were a player short . Turned out I was the best hitter . - So Lou . - Louise is fine . What did you think of the reverse town hall ? I did n't like your joke about being unemployed . - Just a funny line . - Shaving cream and seltzer are funny . Unemployment 's not funny . I got the council chair after this . We could go egg her house . Was there anything that you liked about the town hall ? Sure . I assume you have people around to tell you how great you are . If you do n't , you should hire some . They 're wonderful . No , we pay a premium for that . Are you familiar with the mommy problem ? - I am . - Do you think I have one ? That 's something you have to answer yourself . Beltway Arnie 's kicking you all over the map . Councilwoman Stone , the next president . - Hello , pleasure to meet you . - Nice to meet you . Hello , how are you ? Oh , we 're gon na take a picture here . Okay . Great . - Mr . Lyman , have you okayed banner ... ? - Not now . - We have three print requests for ... - Later . We got ta write up some options . This press marginalia can wait . Great . He 's postponed his reserve drilling a third of the time . Forty-one percent . Whoever gave that letter to TIME has to know that . He stayed in the reserve all these years . Our problem is Santos served too much , whereas Vinick never even served . - You 're gon na be good at this . - What was option one ? Reporting for duty right after Labor Day looking like a gun-toting , flag-waving phony . - A no ? - No on option one ... ? - It 's a law-school study trick . Not getting up till we figure this out . Option two , postponement . Highlights previous postponements , if they even grant him one this time . - Congressman . - Stay seated . I got the high-tech CEOs waiting for me across the hall . I wanted you to know I got Lou to come onboard . - Director of communications . - That 's terrific . You were right , she 's what we need , a whole different take . - I did n't think she 'd do it . - There 's just one small condition . - What 's that ? - Reporting directly to me . If you got a minute , we got an AP problem . - I do n't . Edie , will you tell him why ? - He does n't have ... I 'm trying to solve a problem 50 times bigger than some AP nonsense . I 'll handle it later . - You 'll wan na handle it now . - Photograph ? - Of the congressman 's bed . I need a moment . Can you seal the elevator ? - Is this about TIME magazine ? - I 'm working on that . - Hi . - Maybe Lou 's right . Maybe there is a coordinated effort to throw us off our game . Maybe it 's Vinick , maybe the RNC . I do n't know . - What are you talking about ? - AP has a photograph of something that happened in Cleveland in your hotel bed . Is there anything you 'd like to tell me ? His name is Bruce . He 's a flight attendant on Aer Lingus . They 've got a connecting hub out of Hamburg . At first it was long walks along the Reeperbahn ... - I 'm sorry , but I have to ask . - Jeez . - It 's my job . I 'm sorry . - Wait a minute . Cleveland ? - I do n't understand . - He would n't let me in . - Tell me what happened . - He demolished his bed . - Demolished it ? - It was his wife 's only night on the road . It was an old wooden bed . Hand cranks , what-have-you . - Hand cranks ? - And what-have-you . As much as I respect good craftsmanship I 'm still not clear about what happened . - They broke it together . Get it ? - Wire photo 's out . - Oh , my . - Hurricane Santos . You repeat that outside this room I 'll have you knocking on doors in Alaska , not the urban part . Give me that . That guy 's the next leader of the free world . I wo n't have us ogling his dirty ... You know . The hotel proprietor claims the bed was steel-reinforced . We have a bigger problem than Helen 's Ohio surprise . He 's been called up by the reserves after Labor Day . - Two days of marksmanship and training . - Postponed it ? - Forty-one percent of the time . " See you when I 'm done with government business " ? As in , " See you when it 's convenient and no one has a runny nose . " If I 'd had a full convention , I would 've had Marines in the parking lot in foxholes . You wo n't lift a finger against Arnie , who never served and who flopped his way through years of hearings . I 'm not going negative . People barely know who Santos is . A vacuum gets filled . That 's why he 's the swinging king of the siesta . You wo n't admit the obvious , that the president screwed up on the leak . The president is trying to take politics out ... Why not call a prosecutor ? Why wo n't Santos call for one ? You 're my communications director . Help me solve this problem . You 're the problem , not some box on a grid , not the reserves . When are you gon na stop drinking the Kool-Aid ? I need Hobson at Treasury . They 're worried about currency devaluation in Argentina . While I like a nice prime rib for 35 cents , the OAS ai n't buying . - The message for Monday 's bill signing ? - Scheduling and Advance wants flags . This is America . I want an actual message . I 'm gon na read them the riot act to the tune of " Battle Hymn of the Republic . " - Greg Brock is in your office . - Why is Greg Brock in my office ? He walked in , he would n't leave . I did n't think you 'd want Secret Service . Think again . We 're professionals . We 're under investigation by professionals . It 's bad enough you 're all over my call sheet . Congress has every paper aside from my crosswords . Leave this office before I call in an armored division . - I have a question about daycare . - We ca n't get that out of committee . - That 's great . Della 's 4 and a half . Now , she can live with her mom while I 'm in prison but her mom travels for her job . Why is n't there some voucher you can give your kids to come with you and get them into daycare wherever you go ? Prison ? I would n't talk to the grand jury . I was held in contempt . I report to Cumberland Minimum Security Prison tomorrow . - Should be on Fox by now . - You can appeal . He refused to stay the contempt . At least 18 months . I have to appeal from behind bars . You do n't have to worry about your call sheet . Name your source . I always liked you in that suit . He 's already late for the state party reception downstairs . No . No , Helen , I do n't . No . No ..... Oh , yeah . Because I personally love the fact that it 's in all the papers and ... Honey , bring a sledgehammer with you when we meet in Michigan and we can ... I got ta go . Bye . - How many papers is this gon na be in ? - It 's all over blogs and cable shows . Now the first-tier press gets to cover the coverage . This is my fault . I should have pushed out more policy . I knew it would be hard to hit back against this phony , superficial crap . I do n't think it 's phony or superficial . These stories stick when it confirms what people think . - Face it , nobody knows what to think . - So we deserve it ? You have n't given an alternative formulation on who he is so he 's taking blow after blow . - I 'm positioning him as a guy with ... President 's approval is at 66 percent . The leak has barely made a dent . That 's why he seems like his infant cousin . I 'm sure you 've never presented that argument . Okay . You want me to have a spine , you want me to be nice to my cousin . - Let 's talk about my reserve drill . - You have to resign your commission . - Sir , she 's right . - You ca n't show up after Labor Day when you 've postponed service five times . It 'll look like the mother of all staged photo-ops . Because I moved it ? You wear a uniform when it fits your schedule . And never mind my 25 years of military service compared to Vinick 's none . Never mind one of the most pro-military voting records of the Democratic caucus . Why 'd you leave active duty ? You went to Annapolis for free . The taxpayers were supporting your career . We have a civilian-led military . You are through playing G.I . Joe . He has to get to the reception . TIME 's called twice . We have to tell them something . Tell them if the country does n't like my military record I 'll be the first one unemployed . Tough press day . " Vinick 's comments called into question the Santos campaign 's support of the Bartlet White House as Congressman Santos parried tabloid charges and strained to articulate a message . " " Strained to articulate . " It 's like he was drooling into a cup . So Vinick won the day . Yeah , by walking five feet from his office while the Latin Luther Vandross napped his way across the continent . - Now can we revisit the Bartlet question ? - Hi , let me introduce myself . - I 'm the problem . - I interpret the facts , I read the data . Which is why you need me and why you resent me . Also known as " ethics . " What is unethical about saying , " Jed Bartlet is a great president . Make way on Mount Rushmore . But in this one instance , this lapse in security , he goofed " ? - Someone in your White House goofed . - I read that data too . No one thinks the White House goofed . It 's a press obsession . A Vinick trick to get us onto issues that we ca n't win on . Do you think Vinick participated in last night 's tracking poll ? It took us a couple hours to place Helen on that trip . Remember , she came out as a surprise for you . Anyway , that 's why some of the stories imply that ... - What is this ? - Polling question from last night 's track . " Was the president right to end his investigation of a classified security leak ? Yes , 27 . No , 54 . Do n't know , 19 . But you asked me to run this campaign . I do n't want you thinking I 'm holding back data . - Hi . - Congressman Santos ? You guys got a job to do , whether I like it or not so I 'm not gon na pretend that the afternoon naps and the bedside shrapnel do n't make for good newspaper copy . So I 'm going to address this once , just this once and that 'll be the end of it . Okay ? No way was that bed steel-reinforced . Still no comment about the president stopping his investigation ? You know , if that were my White House , I 'd call in the FBI . I would do everything in my power to cooperate with both Congress and the grand jury . I 'd play it by the law , not by politics . And in case you have n't noticed , that 's exactly what this president is doing . Certainly no one expected today 's decision which means that Greg Brock must report to jail immediately . - Did you see ? - Yeah . - I need Scheduling and Advance . - Scheduling and Advance ? Why ? The fisheries bill signing . They think our message should be a row of flags . - It was my idea . - A row of flags ? Because he 's the American president and he signed a bill into law . As long as we 're being investigated by our own government I do n't see why we should be any more clever than that . - Of the White House press corps . One of the deans of the Washington press corps , if you will . - The First Amendment is sacrosanct . I 've been thinking about the reason I beat you on those primaries . You would n't pound your candidates like I did . This is too important to make it personal . It 's different when you build a candidate from nothing . Just Josh . I appreciate what you said about the president . I 've been thinking about the reserve drill . I think you should do it . Get the past postponements out today , ahead of the letter . - If they slam us for it , we 'll deal with it . - Look out the window . It 's the Rocky Mountains . - You turned the plane around ? - We 're going to Fort Worth . The Marine commandant in Washington ... He was my CO in the Gulf . - He said I could get it out of the way right now if I want . You know , I did n't have as much as a high school diploma in my gene pool . That commission 's the reason why I 'm on this plane . I 'm not giving it up . Before anybody in the press gets a chance to take a shot at us the whole country sees you in uniform . Better cancel our schedule for the next two days . Sorry about Lou before . - Some of her ideas are extreme . - Does n't mean I do n't need them . - You feel you need her at the table ? - I feel you do . - And others . - There has to be somebody in charge to filter out knucklehead stuff . - On the Bartlet campaign ... - Jed Bartlet was in charge . You were right about the president . Louise was right about leaving a vacuum . I need to hear it all . Yep ? They 're ready with that state briefing in the staff cabin . We 're gon na beat him on security issues , beat him on domestic issues ... We 're gon na beat him on trivia too . The Santos campaign refused to comment on the drill saying the candidate was taking care of a personal obligation and would return to economic themes when he ... I think it 's a charade , a made-for-TV movie . Why do you think he stayed in the reserves ? Vinick takes a shot at the president ... " We jumped four points in last night 's poll . What about the gender gap ? Might wan na use " Congressman Casanova " in an ad . - Half the press are calling it a stunt . - They 're all running footage . - When he goes on offense , he goes . - Welcome to the cult of personality . I need that brochure copy on his military record . Edie , get Helen 's schedule . We want her on the road at least three days when he gets back from Texas . Ronna , Ned , foreign-policy events . Best idea gets an extra fortune cookie . - Are we ordering Chinese ? - I 've got menus . - Get the foreign-policy binders ... - Plus economic announcements ... - Santos in that flight suit ... Aides of Senator Vinick say that he will stick to his game plan that they are confident that on national security and other issues their candidate has a commanding advantage . Subtitles @ @ @ @

Now you woke him up . Youwoke him up ! I do n't have any loose teeth , miss fairies . But i have been a very good boy . Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Alright , that does it ! C'm on we 're going to see the boss ! Who 's the boss ? Loogie . My associates here tell me you were working cherry creek tonight . Is that true ? Uh , yeah . Right on our turf , boss , I ai n't never seen that kinda disre-We were there first ! Damn it ! And we thought we were so original ! Let me ask you something , You were gon na sneak a tooth under this rich kid 's pillow ? Then what ? What do you mean ? How were the kid 's parents going to know There was a tooth under their child 's pillow ? Ha ! You guys do n't even know How the tooth trade works ! What 's the tooth trade ? Look , any shmuck can sneak through a window Wearing a pretty dress . The tooth racket is much more involved . We keep careful track of what houses we 've hit So we do n't hit the same ones twice in less than 2 months . We not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow But leave a note for mom and dad to see . This is how we let the parents know To leave money under the pillow . Once the notes have been placed in the last house , We start all over , going back to the first house . And the kids never know what hit ' em . Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! The hardest part is getting teeth . We 've tried various places ... Cemetaries ... Hockey games ... Anywhere we can find them . No ! The teeth we do manage to acquire Are then sorted according to size , color and quality . But there 's never enough teeth ... Never enough . Amazing ! Man , that is tits ! And now my only problem is : What do i do with you ? Raarr ! Tell you what , how would you like to Run the south park tooth racket for me ? Oh , i do n't know . It 's that or i can cut off you penises . Hmmm , work for you , or have my penis cut off . Work for you , or have my ... ? Cartman ! How much do we get if we work for you ? I 'll cut you in at 2% 2% or have my penis cut off ... ? We 're in ! We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this . A giant half-Chicken , half-Squirrel That steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep In order to build some kind of a giant nest For its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring . We believe also , That this creature would have at least a mild understanding Of algebra . Uh , excuse me , i think i have a more logical theory . Well , by all means , mr . Foley , enlighten us . I think what we 've got here is a black market tooth racket . Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth From another group for a profit . Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Oh , mr . Foley , you realize how ridiculous that sounds . It 's not ridiculous , it 's very possible ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha ! And where , pray , is this mon-Tree-Al ? Look , i know how to handle this . All we have to do is bring down the kingpin And the rest will fall . You 'll see , i 'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks . Very well , mr . Foley , you go on your wild goose chase ! And meanwhile , we 'll deal with therealproblems at hand . I will ! Anyway , the half-Chicken half-Squirrel Would most likely be 3 to 4 ? feet tall His large beak is probably detachable And works as a flotation device . Hello there , children ! Hey , chef ! Hey , chefhey , chef ! We all want double desserts today ! Oh , well , i 'm afraid that the school charges extra for that . Oh yeah well , that ai n't nothin ' but athang . Oh my god ! There 's got to be at least $15 here . Children ! What have i old you about drugs ? That there 's a time and a place for everything And it 's calledcollege . That 's right ! And the only thing worse than doin ' drugs , is dealing ' drugs . I 'm gon na tell you about when i was your age And got offered drugs . Oh , c'm on now . Hey kid , you wan na try some dope ? What ?

Get outta my sight ! You lousy little scum ! What ! This is your last chance , kid . Either you give the boss his cut , Or else we 're gon na throw your pal into the river Wearing concrete galoshes . I ai n't giving ' you crap , kenny 's not afraid of you ! Oh , my god ! This book says that negative and positive are the same thing . He 's not gon na do it , boss . Well , then , throw him in .

@@5228041 That 's very good . Well , that 's very nice . No , it is n't . I just ca n't get it right . You think the wings are too big ? Oh , no , not at all . Birds have wings of all sizes , Eric . And you should n't worry about making it look perfect . But Mrs . Narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as realistic as possible . Well , she 's right . It is important that you be able to make the clay take the shape you want it to have but you 're not supposed to be concentrating on technique today . I 'm here to help you focus on the feelings you want to convey with your sculpture . For instance what do you think about when you see a bird ? Flying ? Fine . So make your sculpture make me think of flying , too . How 's it going , Data ? I have finished . The dimensions are accurate to within 1.3%%% . I 'm sure they are ... abstract . Here ... I want you to start a new piece . I 'd like you to sculpt ... music . Counselor , music is a collection of acoustic vibrations . How can I reproduce a sound with clay ? Well , think of the effects that sounds have on people . The images that music brings to your mind . And then , give it a form . It 's a start . Riker to Data , please report to the Bridge . Acknowledged , sir . On my way . Captain 's Log , Stardate 47615.2 . We have encountered a rogue comet in Sector 1156 . It is not native to this region of space and there is no previous record of this object on any Federation charts . Based on its present trajectory the comet appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system . That 's over two sectors away . That is correct , sir . This object has been en route for 87 million years . Data and log the findings with the Federation Astrophysical Survey . Aye , sir . The comet 's outer shell is composed primarily of gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle . The inner core consists of heavier elements . What was that ? There is a distortion within the comet 's inner core . I believe we experienced an intense sensor echo . Can you correct for it ? I am attempting to do so now , sir . I have compensated for the effect . Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep . We are still picking up some interference but the distortion is manageable . At these settings , the scan will be complete in 39 hours . Worf says he 's going to teach us some Mok'bara throwing techniques today . More like falling techniques . Last time we did that , I was sore for a week . What 's this ? I have no idea . I 've never seen it before . Maybe Will left it for you ... a little present ... that 's an interesting thought . Well , you 'll figure it out later . Come on , we 're going to be late . Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission ... to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before . That 's nice . Data ... this is amazing . How did you come up with this ? I followed your advice , Counselor . I used my imagination . That 's an understatement . For some reason , as I was shaping the clay the image of the mask was exceptionally clear in my mind . The design seemed to flow quite naturally . Data , have you been in my quarters ? No , Counselor . Someone left an object in my room . Some kind of artifact . And it has something very similar to this . And you do n't know anything about it ? I do not . Excuse me , Counselor . These symbols do n't match anything in the Federation linguistics banks . Some kind of alien information has been downloaded into our computer core . I do n't know how it 's working but it 's reconfiguring our systems . How did it get in ? I was able to trace its path from the replicators to the sensor array . The sensors ? They 've been scanning that comet for the past 18 hours . Those energy readings from the comet 's core ... that sensor echo ... we still do n't know what 's inside that thing . Maybe it 's about time we find out . Could we use the phasers to melt down the shell of the comet ? Yes , a dispersed wide-field beam might do the trick . And it would n't take long to come up with the firing parameters . What do you think , Data ? Data ... what 's wrong ? I believe I recognize these symbols . How ? I do not know . What do you think they mean ? Boundary . Border . Road . Companion . Message . Messenger . What 's that one ? Death . Captain , phasers are set for wide dispersal . Ten percent maximum power . The beam will automatically terminate once the comet 's core is reached . Very well , Mr . Worf . Fire . Phasers have terminated . Mr . Data , what are we looking at ? Is it a ship ? I do not know , sir . The object is nearly solid . It is composed primarily of fortanium and several unknown materials . It is over 87 million years old . That 's older than the comet itself . Could someone from the D'Arsay system have built it ? There are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now , but perhaps ... 87 million years ago , there were . Why would they want to hide something like that inside a comet ? Possibly ... They 're using our sensor beam as a carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and replicators . But the question remains , why ? What is its purpose ? Captain , I believe this object is an informational archive . Why do you say that , Mr . Data ? I do not know . However , I seem to have an intuitive understanding of its function . Data , the internal structure of that thing is pretty complex . And it 's got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a database of some kind but it could be practically anything . I do n't see how you can know for sure what it is . Data , do you believe that you 're in communication with that object ? It is a possibility , sir . I recommend we run a level-1 diagnostic of my positronic net to determine if that is the case . Very well . - Mr . La Forge , give him a hand . But we must be careful . Mr . Worf , will you keep an eye on the sensors ? If the ship is in any danger I want you to sever the connection immediately . Aye , sir . Come . Captain ? Yes , come in , Number One . We 've confined the system corruption . It wo n't be spreading any further . But we still have alien symbols floating around in our computer . This is quite a collection you 've assembled . I 've seen these things all over the ship . They all look the same ... primitive and nonfunctional . Ah , ceremonial . And deceptively primitive . Only an advanced technological society could have built that object out there . These artifacts played a ritualistic role in that society , I think . That library seems designed to do so much more than simply store information . Who knows what we might not learn from this ? I keep seeing this design . Yes , this symbol seems to be of particular significance . What do you think it means ? Well , the concept of the four cardinal compass directions are quite common in many different cultures . The words that Data recognized in the computer ... boundary , border , road ... they were all arranged in this design . Well , perhaps the artifacts that all have this compass symbol belong to the same theme ... movement finding a direction , traveling a path crossing a boundary . And death ? One of the symbols was death . Well , the ultimate boundary . I 've seen this symbol everywhere , too but much less prominently displayed . It 's always in the background ... much smaller than the others . What do you think it represents ? I have no idea . Lower synaptic functions are completely normal . All right . Data , what 's wrong ? I am not certain . I am experiencing a ... curious sensation . Well ... what is it ? An impulse . Impulse ? What kind of impulse ? I ... do not know . I 'm going to check out your higher functions . Geordi . What ... does it feel like when a person is losing his mind ? Data , come on , you 're scaring me . Now , what 's going on ? I do not know . I ... am different . Well , you 're going to be all right . You 're with me , okay ? Okay . Listen , I 'm going to disconnect you . What 's going on ? Data ... Masaka is waking . Captain ... Captain ! I 've been waiting for you . You should feel honored . I do n't usually wait for anyone . What is it you want ? Masaka is waking . Are you Masaka ? I am not Masaka ! I am lhat . Yes . He 's gone . Who can say where ? Picard to Counselor Troi . Report to Main Engineering immediately . Picard to Counselor Troi . Report to Main Engineering immediately . Lhat , this place you come from is it a cultural archive of your species ? I come from Masaka 's city . Are there others like you there ? There are no others like me . Who is Masaka ? You will find out . I would like to know Masaka , speak with her . Do you understand pain ? Death ? That is all you need to know of Masaka . It is what she is . Go . Leave this place before she finds you . It can be done . I did it . Masaka . I am yours . Every part of me is yours . We should confine him to quarters . This is a micrograph of what 's happened to Data 's positronic net . Now , as near as I can tell , these are behavioral nodes . As a result , Data 's real personality has been completely buried . In a sense , Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities . The archive has n't stopped yet . Data 's positronic net is still being transformed . There 's no telling how many more personalities might emerge . Geordi , I want you to continue to scan the archive and see if you can find some way to access it and in the meantime I 'll see what I can learn from these ... people inside Data . I 'm not going to hurt you . Only Masaka can hurt me . I am for her ... alone . I need to speak with lhat . Do you understand ? Lhat . Captain . That was a cruel joke you played on me . For a moment ... a brief moment ... I actually thought that woman was Masaka . Whoever took your place was n't afraid of Masaka . Then Masaka is your queen . She 's a lazy creature . She spends most of her time sleeping . Problem is what she does when she 's awake . Then we should try to keep her asleep ? Try to stop the sun from climbing the sky , hmm ? Uh-uh . Only Korgano can do that and he 's not here . Where is he ? Help me . Please . What 's wrong ? I 'm afraid . Of what ? Her . Masaka ? Her ! Picard to Bridge . Report . The archive just activated some sort of tractor beam , sir . We 're not able to disengage it . Has there been any damage to the ship ? There was an emergency reported in Ten-Forward . Mr . Worf 's on his way . Captain , there 's some kind of energy pulse coming through the tractor beam . It 's overriding our control systems . I 'll be right there . Does it hurt ? Yes . She 's going to hurt us all . Now you 've done it , Captain . Masaka is awake . Who 's this ? I 'd say that that is Masaka . He had referred to her as " queen " and it 's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolized by a sun . You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her , even terrified ? Well , according to Data the sun image is also a symbol for death . See , there it is again ... the same u-shaped symbol small and insignificant almost as if it 's an afterthought . Captain , this is incredible . These artifacts were n't beamed here from the archives . The matter here in Ten-Forward has been transformed . Into living plants ? How is that possible ? I 'm not sure , but bit by bit , this ship is being transformed . We have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship . Part of deck 12 is now an aqueduct . I do n't think we have any choice . We must destroy that archive , Mr . Worf . Sir , our weapons control systems are inoperative . However , we could reconfigure a photon torpedo for manual launch . Make it so . There 's so much more here that we could have learned . I really regret losing that opportunity . Okay , I 've locked in the targeting parameters . What 's the phase alignment now ? Less than.7%%% . Good , that 'll do it . I 'm setting the yield at maximum . Sir , the onboard power systems are not functioning . Let 's see what 's going on here . Whoa ! Something tells me we 'd better get out of here . Engineering to Bridge . Emergency transport . Two to beam out . Maybe we 'd better talk out here . The observation lounge has turned into a swamp . So ... what 's our status ? Well , so far the archive has transformed about 20% of the ship . Life-support seems to be unaffected . I 've analyzed the alien plant forms . They 've developed from biological matter we have on the ship . The stone , the artifacts are made in much the same way ... extrapolating from the ship 's own alloys . Apparently , the archive can reorder and transform molecular structure ... including DNA ... into anything it wants . So it 's using our ship , our alloys , our DNA to create elements of its own culture . But why is this happening ? What does the archive hope to accomplish ? Well , whatever the intent that lies behind its process I 'm not going to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city . Mr . La Forge , do you have any ideas ? Well , we still have n't been able to cut off that beam but I have managed to access the archive by sending an energy pulse back along their signal path ... with Masaka . We must find her ... access her . Hello . Difficult ... to stay warm . It 's not warm enough ... not for an old man . Tell me about Masaka . My ... daughter . Tell me how can I talk to her . Children ... grow ... forget their parents ... No ... Only Korgano can talk to Masaka . Korgano . Who is that ? Well , are n't we the persistent one ? Lhat ? Is anyone else so charming ? Masaka is taking over my ship . I told you she would . I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is the only one who can do that . Who told you that ? An old man . Masaka 's father . Oh , yes . Yes . Legend has it she chopped him up and used his bones to make the world . I was fast enough to get away from her once . I do n't want her to find me again . I 'll wind up on her sacrificial slab . Lhat , if she 's looking for a sacrifice she can take me . Perhaps then she 'll stop looking for you . Well , there 's an idea . Better you than me . Very well . What do we do ? You must build Masaka 's temple . The Queen 's temple . That will get her attention . Very well . How do I do that ? You need the sign . I could give it to you . So could the old man . But just try getting it out of him . Give me the sign . If she finds out ... you ca n't imagine her rage . She lets people ... die of thirst . A terrible death . Sometimes , she burns them alive . She is glorious . Lhat , the sign . Give it to me . Quickly , give me your hand . A line , as the unending horizon . A curve as ... She has found me . Masaka , show yourself . I will go with you . It seems ... I was not fast enough . So hard ... to stay warm . Are you one of my children ? I ca n't remember anymore . I need your help . I need the sign for the temple . For Masaka 's temple . It wo n't help you . Korgano no longer pursues her . Only he can stop her . A line as the unending horizon . A curve as ... A line , as the unending horizon . A curve ... As ... the rolling hillside . A point ... as a distant bird . A ray ... as the rising sun . Thank you . Now ... come sit with me . Tend the fire . I 'm alone . No one left to help me . She 's coming . Are all the others dead ? Did Masaka kill them ? No . La Forge ? I think I 've found the archive 's transformation program . Will it accept the symbol for Masaka 's temple ? I think so . I 've isolated the program 's input pathways ... their key to accept symbols . If I input this one it should initiate the transformation program . And create the temple ? Well , I hope so . If this is the wrong symbol it might turn the Enterprise into a big chunk of rock . No way to know for sure . The question is , can we trust a personality from an alien archive that seems bent on taking us over ? Lhat risked his life to show me that symbol . And Masaka killed him for doing it . I think we have to risk it . Captain , the entire deck has been cleared of personnel . We may proceed . Commander Riker , we 're ready . Understood . Initiate transformation . Inputting the symbol now . It would seem that this is Masaka 's temple . It may be some time before she shows herself . How will she do that ? I do n't know . Captain ? Take a look at this . This is the first time I 've seen these two symbols paired . That could be significant . Look , there it is again . And again . And there , again . This is obviously an important pairing . He is n't chasing her anymore . Sir ? Lhat said that someone called Korgano is n't chasing Masaka anymore . And the old man said , " he pursues her no longer . " In a sense , the small symbol might be seen to be chasing Masaka . The symbol suggests antlers of some kind , uh , horns . Maybe it is meant to represent an animal ? Animals are worshipped in many cultures . That smaller symbol could represent Korgano . Lhat and the old man said that Korgano was the only one who could control Masaka . It 's not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart a consort . Look around . See if you can see that horn-like symbol anywhere else . This is the most prominent instance of the horn symbol we 've seen yet . But now it appears as though Masaka 's sun is chasing it . The sun chasing an animal ? Maybe it 's simpler than that . Maybe their relationship is more like ... the sun and the moon . I see . Masaka and Korgano switching positions . The sun setting , and the moon rising . Exactly . Like two powerful rulers changing places in a continual cycle . And like the sun and the moon only one of them can be in ascendance at any given time . If we can find Korgano in the archive and bring him out then perhaps he could force Masaka to leave . But would we be better off with him ? Hmm . Lhat and the others did n't seem to be frightened of Korgano . Sir ? Masaka . Please hear us . Your archive is destroying ... I do not hear you ! She will not even listen to us . Then we will have to find someone to whom she will listen . I found it , Captain . This is the only place in the archive where Korgano 's moon symbol appears by itself , not linked with Masaka 's . All right , Mr . La Forge I want you to access the transformation program and , when you 're ready , input the symbol . Is n't that a little risky ? We have no idea what the result would be . The symbol might generate anything from Korgano 's temple to Korgano himself . In one sense , Korgano is Masaka 's nemesis . And whatever this symbol represents it could be , for us , a means to control her . Now , if anyone has a better idea I 'm very happy to entertain it . I 've accessed the program , Captain . Initiate the transformation . Another mask . Perhaps we should try to confront them on those terms . If I could somehow incorporate myself in their ritual then perhaps Masaka would listen to me . You 're going to try to pose as Korgano ? Captain , we know so little about this culture and even less about Korgano . How would you convince Masaka that you 're him ? Well , I 'm really not certain but there are similarities between this culture and others that I 've studied . I would imagine I 'm just going to improvise . Mr . Worf , what 's our status ? I estimate we have less than two hours before there is nothing left of the ship at least nothing we can recognize . Masaka ? Korgano . Are you surprised to see me ? I thought I had escaped you . You should know that is impossible . You are a fine hunter , but I am a powerful prey . You will never catch me . But without me , you are not complete . I know you so well . You live for the chase , as do I . Will you not miss being the hunter ? Pursuing me ? Forcing me from the sky , so that you can rise again ? You know me well , Korgano . I think ... that you are beginning to tire . It is difficult brightening the sky forever . Hmm . I am getting sleepy . You always do that to me . So that you can wake with the dawn . And begin the hunt again . Let the hunt begin again . I am eager for that . As am I . Riker to Picard . I do n't know what you did , sir but it looks like everything 's back to normal . Acknowledged . Mr . Data , you all right ? I believe so , sir . I am not entirely certain what has happened . Starfleet has dispatched an archeological team to study the archive further . But I do n't understand . I thought all of the alien artifacts had disappeared from the Enterprise . That one was not created by the archive , sir . That is the clay mask I originally made . I have since painted it . A memento ? Yes , sir . Although I am ... relieved to be rid of those alien personalities in a sense , I am now ... empty . Hmm . I can imagine . Dr . Crusher told me that there were possibly dozens of personalities inside you . I suspect the number was much greater . My impression is that there were thousands of all ages and walks of life . It was a remarkable experience . Well , Data , you never may become fully human but you 've had an experience that transcends the human condition .

That 's , um - - We 'll make plans . You can finish up what you have to do here and then -- That 's the thing , you know , there 's nothing here . I 'm ready now . Let's-- Let 's go . Let 's just keep driving and go . Right . That 's , like , 2,000 miles . How about we go back and get my bag and your stuff , and then we 'll fly back as soon as -- No , I mean it . If we go back to my house , my mom -- Well , she - - You know what she 'd do . So-- So let 's just do it , Charlie . Let 's just drive back to San Francisco .  Take me home , please . Okay .  Okay .   Hey , Bailey . What ? Bailey , do you want me to get that ? No . The machine , uh ... Bailey , are you drunk ? Hung over . What is going on with you ? You know , you 're really starting to scare me . Not now , Sarah . God . No . You said you 're not supposed to drink , look at you . I do n't - - I ca n't do this right now . Okay ? Please . Is it me ? Is it me ? I mean , did I do something ? I just wish you 'd tell me . No . No . You did n't do anything . I do n't believe you . Why else would you be treating me this way ? It 's - - it 's nothing . Okay ? It 's nothing . It has to be something , Bailey . Because you said that you were n't supposed to drink . And you said that you were n't supposed to have sex , and if you could do one , then why ca n't - - ? I did both , Sarah . I did both . What ? I ca n't ... It 's not you . It 's not your fault . I ca n't lie to you . Callie . I -- With Callie .  Oh . Sarah . I know . I know what you want , b-but this is a mistake . No , honey , you know what your doctors said . You 're not well enough to -- I know you love him , sweetheart . I know you do . But my God , I mean-- Kirsten ? We 're south of Chicago in a snowstorm . But , anyway , I 'm using up all the tape here . Um , we 'll see you guys in a couple of days . Pretty cool , huh ? So how 'd that go ? Is everything okay ? What ? Yeah . I mean , she 's upset , but I think I convinced her . We should get going . Okay . Bailey , hey , wake up , wake up . Go away . Bailey , you turned the machine down . So what ? Stop talking . Bailey , your sister 's in the hospital . What ? Which one ? County General . She 's -- No . Bailey , jeez . I 'm okay . Leave me alone . I 'm okay . Look , do you want me to drive you ? Would you mind ? Hey , where have you been ? I called the apartment . I called Sarah . You called Sarah ? Yeah . It 's kind of-- I 'm sorry . She 's okay , right ? Yeah , she 's okay . She 's -- God , you look like hell . What happened to you ? Jus-- Nothing . Okay ?  Claud ? Hey . Hey , how you doing ? Hey . Bailey ? Right here . I 'm right here . You came all the way over here just for me ? Of course I did . You know I did . I brought this for ya . Wow . You 're so thoughtful . I was just dreaming . My mouth 's all full of cotton . Bailey , would you get me some juice or something ? Yeah , sure . I 'll be right back . WOMAN  : Dr . Austin to Labor and Delivery . Hi . Claudia Salinger 's room , please . 327 . Right over there . Thank you . What are you doing here ? Oh , Sarah , I just gave Bailey a ride . How could you ? You know , after what you did ? What ? He told you . I tried to help you through that whole rape thing , and what was that ? Sarah -- Was that just some twisted excuse to get Bailey to spend time with you ? Is that it ? Is that how it happened ? I mean , you made him feel sorry for you ? I 'm gon na go . Okay ? I-I should go . How could you do this ? Look , maybe you should talk to Bailey . Sarah . These are for Claudia . Have us a roast steak for dinner , pick up a change of clothes . What 's the next town ? Um , Lincoln . But that 's at least - - I do n't -- You know what , I-- I do n't -- I 'm not ready to stop yet . Let 's just keep going until the next town . Let 's just stop in Lincoln . Do you want me to drive ? No , no . That 's , uh-- That 's fine . Your mom let me in . I was walking . Just walking . Trying to understand . Why would you do this , Bailey ? I wish-- I wish I could explain , but I do n't know . And I know that 's not even -- I know that 's not good enough . And I know you deserve more than that , but I do n't know , Sarah . I do n't know . Can you go , please . I love you . Do n't . I love you and - - Stop it , please . Yell at me . Call me names and - - And-- And throw things , and hit me and tell me you never want to see me again . I should . Cause I really hate you for this , Bailey . And I never thought that was possible . But there it is . I hate you so much for this . I know . And I wan na hurt you , and tell you to go to hell . I want to do all those things so bad . But I ca n't . I 'm still in love with you . And that 's not just gon na go away . Because ...  you 're the one that 's supposed to hold me . Sarah . I ca n't . Not yet . Okay ... whatever you wan na do . Did you have a good shower ? Lousy . The water 's so soft I could n't get the shampoo out of my hair . That and the fact that there 's no water pressure , and the towels are nubbly . Nubbly ? Yeah , you know , covered with nubs . I hate that . Right . But , other than that , you okay ? Stop asking me that . I just hate nubbly towels . Is that a crime ? No , of course not . I 'm , uh - - I 'm gon na take a shower . Oh , this is perfect . What ? What 's the matter ? Look at this . Look at this . What 's wrong ? They look clean . They 're worn out , Charlie , and they 're nubbly . I do n't see that - - Right there . Feel that . Everything in this place is - - Is nubbly . All right . I 'm sorry .  Sorry . I 'm just -- I 'm just tired . That 's all . Are you sure ? Yes . Yes , um , just ... go take your shower . It 's okay . Kirsten . I 'm okay .  I 'm okay , Charlie . I 'm fine .  Okay . Kirsten ? Why do n't you come back to bed ?  Hey , it 's okay . Shh . It 's okay . You wan na talk about it ? It 's too soon , Charlie . I thought I was ready , but it 's too soon . Will you take me home ? Shh .  Hello ? Oh . Hey . No . No , I was just sitting here . You know . How was skiing ? Oh , sorry I missed it . Huh ? No . No . The nurse told me to go home , but , I do n't know , I could n't stand the thought of leaving her all alone here . Yeah , yeah . She 's fine . I 'm the one who 's feeling lousy . Sure . That 'd be great . All right . Bye .  Do n't worry . I wo n't stay in here . I 'll be out in the waiting room . Actually , um ... do you think there 's any of that orangeade left ? Sure . Sure . * Six o'clock And it 's way down low * * She looked at me Saying " We got ta go now " * * Not the way I feel More the way things sound * Do you mind ? No .  Sorry . It just helps drown everything else so I can think . This stupid paper . Hey , look , it's-- It 's cool if you need some time . You know . I mean , I 'm okay with that . Trust me , I know it sucks to break up with someone . We did n't . Hm , yeah , seems like you said that once before . Standing right about there as I recall . Do n't , please . I 'm only telling you this because we 're gon na try and work it out . And you should know that . What the hell are you doing , Bailey ? Oh , God , you know -- You know , you 're just -- You 're not worth it .  * We got ta go * * Remember the time * * Got ta put away the game * Kirsten ? What 's the matter ? Kirsten ? I ca n't do this , Charlie . I ca n't do this anymore . I know . I 'm taking you back . No . No . It 's not -- My therapist tried to tell me and I would n't even go there . I know that . I got really good at justifying and rationalizing , but I would n't listen ... What it was like to be in love with you . And I tried to defend it because I love you so much . And all that time I was getting better , and I started recognizing myself in the mirror again and that felt -- What ? What ? It 's you , Charlie . I ca n't be with you . Okay . Okay . Obviously , we - - We tried to rush into this . Obviously , this was too soon to think that we could do this , but that does not mean - - Charlie , I ca n't . That 's what I 'm trying -- I 'm just -- I 'm doing it again . I-I 'm with you and I -- And I think I 'm happy , but -- But it 's always there . When you left me -- The wedding -- That was -- That was just - - Wait a minute . What ? This is about the wedding ? That 's not - - That 's not fair , Kirsten . Look at me since I 've been with you . And look at me . I know that you 've changed , Charlie , but that 's just -- The wedding triggered it , this thing . Something that was already inside of me . And now you 're all tangled up in that somehow , and I ca n't just get past it . I -- I tried to make it go away , but it just-- It wo n't . I love you . But every time I look at you , it 's -- It 's all I see . And I know it 's not fair . And I know it 's not your fault , but it 's all I see . Darling .  You do n't have to be here every minute , you know . Mm . I 'm okay . I know that . So guess what ? Dr . Eglar said I 'll be able to wear a bikini without showing a scar . Hey , that 's a plus . We should do that . The two of us , you know . Swim , check out the guys . Huh ? How does that sound ? Claud ? SAM : Where 's my camera when I need it ? JULIA : Hey . For me ? Actually , no . They 're for Claudia . I hope flowers are okay . I did n't know whether I should do that or candy or stuffed toy something . I 've never been around kids much , so . JULIA : She loves flowers . It 's sweet . So you have n't dated somebody with kids before , huh ? Ca n't say that I have . ' Cause it 's not like I have kids , but I sort of do . And it 's just kind of how my life is . Sometimes I 'm gon na have to baby-sit , and sometimes I 'm gon na have to cancel at the last minute and -- Sometimes you 're gon na be doing homework . I know . Wow . Amazing . Huh . It 's a good word . Julia . Hey , I 'm right here , Owen . I 'm right here . Kirsten ? Kirsten , honey , are you all right ? I 'm fine , mom . Are you sure ? Are you ? I 'm glad you came back . Charlie , I ca n't believe that - - Mom , do n't . Okay ? Not now . You wan na come inside ? No . I do n't think - -  Could you just maybe , uh , get my bag for me ? I 'm just gon na -- Sure . I 'll be right back . Kirsten . Yeah ? Nothing . Just , uh , my shaving kit 's in the bathroom . I 'll get it . Charlie , how dare you . How dare you come here and put her through this . What ? Look , Kirsten just -- Just send it to me . Okay ? I ca n't - - I ca n't do this again , and she should n't have to either . * What else can I do ? * * But bring a blanket * * For you * So pretty lame match , huh ? Hm ? I guess so . Yeah . I think that one guy must have lied about his weight class . He was a gorilla . Yeah . But you put up a good fight . Um ... I 'm half done . You ready to trade ? Yeah . * What else can I do * * But lend my shoulder * * To you ? * * Or to bury your head * Hello . The only thing different is that I 'm disgusted with myself . Is this the way to the movies ? What is this place ? I 'll just be a minute . Willow and Dawn have been missing for hours . - Do you know how long I 've been here ? - Let 's get outta here . Dawnie , I 'm sorry ! - You could have killed her ! - I need help . No more spells . I 'm finished . - Got it . - It 's beautiful . Phase one of the plan is now complete . Candles ? We ca n't have candles ? Dawn , it 's a magic clearance . Everything must go . But they 're just candles . Well , to you and me they 're just candles , but to witches they 're ... like bongs . So , no candles , no charms , no ... - Bird . - No bird ? The peacock on the table . It has two crystals in it . Tara , she ... she left them . I love him . And he was Mom 's . Why do we have to get rid of so many things I like ? Dawn , I explained this to you . Willow has a problem . The next few weeks are gon na be crazy hard on her as it is . Any reminder of what it is that she 's trying to stay away from could cause her to give in to temptation . And that would be bad . OK , that 's it . It 's finally done . I mean , it still needs a trial run , but it 's ... - Kinda clunky-lookin ' . - What ? I pictured something cooler . More ILM , less Ed Wood . You wan na see cool ? I 'll show you cool . Mama ! Did it ... ? Is it ... ? Yeah . - I 'd call that a successful test . - Well , that 's just half the test . Hey ... Hey ! - You penis ! And I 'd say that makes us pretty much unstoppable . Dawn , come on . You got ta eat breakfast . Xander 's gon na be here any second . She 's gon na be late for school again . - How are you doing ? - I 'm OK . Not " ready to head back to classes , face the world " OK , but ... the shakiness is only semi now . I thought I 'd spend the day fishing the Net for more poop on the stolen diamond . I called you before . Did n't hear you . Hey , Dawnie , I 'm making you a nice omelette . Not hungry . Dawn , you need to eat something . Thanks for your concern . OK , I deserve the wrath of Dawn , but why is she taking it out on you ? Because I let it happen . - Buffy , I was the one who ... - Who was drowning . My best friend . Morning . What are you doing ? And here ? Just took a stroll . Found myself in your neck of the woods . Could n't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll ? Well , the fact is my lighter 's gone missing . Thought I might 've dropped it here . Have n't seen it . I 'm gon na head back to my room , get dressed . Oh , I ... - Lame . - What ? You . Making up excuses . Oh , do n't flatter yourself , love . Bloody fond of that lighter . Stop trying to see me . And stop calling me that . So , um ... what should I call you then ? Pet ? Sweetheart ? My ... little Goldilocks ? You know , I love this hair . The way it bounces around when ... Uh-uh-uh ! This flapjack 's not ready to be flipped . What the hell is that supposed to ... ? Stop that . Good Godfrey Cambridge , Spike ! Only a complete loser would hook up with you . Unless she 's a simpleton like Harmony , or a nut sack like Drusilla ... Hey ! You really need to get Dawn off to school . Let 's go fetch her , OK ? You can let yourself out , right , Spike ? - Dawn ! Xander 's here ! - I 'm here . You have everything ? And after school , you ... - Yeah , yeah . Let 's go , Xander . - You will come straight home ? Sure . Maybe we can find some time for you to get me into another car accident . - Oh , good morning . You must be Dawn . - May I help you ? I 'm Doris Kroger , from Social Services . We had an appointment ? - Oh , for Wednesday . - This is Wednesday . Right . Well , Dawn , you better ... - And , Xander , you 'll drive safely ? - Yes , ma'am . Sorry about the mess . We 're doing a little house-clean . So , we gon na chat this out , or what ? Now 's really not a good time . I have company . No worries . I 'll wait . Um , Ms Summers , if you and your boyfriend would like ... He 's not ... Not my boyfriend . He 's just a ... Spike , this nice woman is from Social Services . Oh , right . Hey , Buffy 's a great mom . She takes good care of her little sis . Like , when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt , Buffy put a right stop to it . - I 'm sorry , did you say ... - Crib . Crib . He said crib . You know kids today and their buggin ' street slang . Spike , did n't you have to go now , you know , because of that thing ? Thing , yeah . My blanket ... That 's ... it 's a security thing . He ... has issues . Nope , just me and Dawn living here . Buffy , I 'm not feeling hot , so I 'm gon na take a quick nap , OK ? OK , Will ! That 's Willow . She kinda lives here too , actually . Oh , so you live with another woman ? Oh ... Oh , it 's not a gay thing , you know . Well , she 's gay , but we do n't ... gay . Not that there 's anything ... wrong with ... You know , I know what that looks like , but I swear it 's not what it looks like . It 's magic weed . It 's not mine . I think I 've seen enough . No , actually , I really do n't think that you have . It 's just ... it 's been kind of a bad time . - But there are good reasons . - Oh , I 'm sure there are . But my interest is in Dawn 's welfare and the stability of her home life - something I 'm just not convinced that an unemployed young woman can provide . I can . I do . Well , we 'll just have to see about that then , wo n't we ? Oh , and I 'm going to recommend immediate probation in my report . What does that mean ? It means that I 'll be monitoring you very closely , Ms Summers . And if I do n't see that things are improving , I 'll be forced to recommend that you be stripped of your guardianship . You ca n't do that . I do what is in Dawn 's best interest ... as should you . Have a nice day . Did n't go well , huh ? Why wo n't you go ? - I just thought you 'd want ... - Get out of here ! Well , I think I can work with this . What exactly would you like me to do ? Just make me ... different . - What if we get caught ? - No way . We 'll be invisible . - Plus their security 's gotten lax . - You should know . You 've cased it enough . OK , this is it . Remember ... we 're professionals . - Uh , Slayer ! - What ? Where ? There . Headed this way . - Give it ! - I need to be invisible ! I need it more ! Buffy ca n't see me ! - Watch it ! Do n't touch the ... Oopsie . What happened to Buffy ? She 's gone . She 's right here . Table four . I put her with your family . Great . Except we do n't hate Buffy . Let 's put her back at table one . - Well , where do I put D'Hoffryn ? - We 're not inviting D'Hoffryn . - Hey , Buffy ... Where ... where are you ? At table four , apparently . Well , that remains to be seen . Like you . Do n't strain yourself looking , Xander . I 'm Invisible Girl . - Uh , Xander ? - Sorry ! Her clothes are ... invisible too . Buffy , how did this hap ... Wait a sec . Have you been feeling ignored lately ? Yeah , ignored - I wish . No , this is n't a Marcie deal . I left Main Street after getting my hair cut ... - You cut your hair ? - Oh , yeah ! Really ? How short ? About up to here . If you could see my hand , it 's kind of above my shoulders . Sounds adorable ! I was thinking of getting my hair cut ... Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy ? This is serious . I know . It kinda fits the day I 've had . Says she 's gon na " watch " me . Like to see her try now . You know , there may be an upside to no-see me . Buff , did you see anyone or ... anything suspicious before you ... cleared up ? Nope , did n't see nothin ' . See what I did there , with the eyeballs ? Why would anyone make her invisible anyway ? I mean , an invisible slayer 's got ta be way more effective than the standard variety . I 'm less with the why and more with the how . We get the how , then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again , right ? ' S all right ! Buffy , could you focus , please ? I am . Just ... this is kinda fun . Well , it would help if we had a little bit more to go on . Or ... anything to go on . Well , I could go check the spot where Buffy disappeared , snoop for clues ... go for a walk . - A walk ? - Yeah . Clear my head . You guys keep working on the what's and hows . - Clear my head ! - Buffy ! Well , seems pretty obvious it 's some kind of spell that 's done this to her . A spell from who ? You said it yourself , it makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible . - Maybe it 's a mistake . - A magical mistake . Who 'd be messing with that kind of pow ... - Willow . - Xander . - How 's it goin ' ? - Um ... good . I found out some stuff about the diamond stolen from the museum . It 's called the Illuminata . There 's rumours it has quasi-mystical quantum properties . Willow , we need to talk . We are . Well , I 'm talking and you 're looking at me funny . Is there something you wan na tell me ? It was nothing . I ... We just have to figure a way to fix it . - Fix what ? - Fix Buffy . - Buffy 's broken ? - Will , you know what I 'm talkin ' ... You do n't know . Rhymes with ... blinvisible ? What ? Buffy was leaving the haircutting place when she ... - Buffy got her hair cut ? - Yeah ! Adorable , apparently . I personally could n't tell , since she 's all blinvisible . And you think I have something to do with this ? No . Not ... Will , your spells have caused weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another . - And let 's not forget the recent forgetting . - Oh . I see . So now when anything nasty happens , I get conveniently blamed for it ? No one 's blaming . So I guess it would n't matter if I just jump off the wagon completely , since you already think I 'm making pit stops . Couple of circuits are burned out and the wiring 's all fried . But we had so many plans . Naked women , and all ... well , all the naked women . - It 's your fault . If you had n't grabbed it ... - We got bigger problems , bonehead . The Slayer 's invisible now ? He 's right . She could be anywhere . Even here , right now . Watching , listening to every word we say . For all we know , she could be one of us . - Oh ... - No , wait , no , guys , that is n't true . I would n't sweat the Slayer too much . Says you . In my book , an invisible slayer means a whole world of trouble . I am the ghost of fashion victims past . Studded caps ? Not a good idea . Hey ! I 'm doing you a favour ! Nah . Too easy . Hmm ... So long , copper ! Hey ! What ? Where 's my ... Losing my mind . OK , who 's the ... Kill . Kill . Kill . What ? - I did n't say anything . - Not you . The mug ! It 's ... But I ... I heard something . Kill , Doris . Kill everybody . - You know you want to . - Shut up , shut up ! Just shut up ! OK ... No ... No ... Yahtzee ! Doris . I 've got a few , so if you wan na discuss that case file now ... What ? Oh . Oh , yes , the Summers file . It 's right over here . It 's a 15-year-old girl , living under her sister 's guardianship . The house is a complete ... What is this ? " All work and no play make Doris a dull girl " ? - What ? - " All work and no play make Doris ... " The pages are filled with it . I ... I ... I ... I did n't do this . It made my coffee dance . - It told me to ... - To ... what ? Nothing . Doris ... take the rest of the day off . - See your doctor . - What about my cases ? We 'll ... put someone else on them . - And have them redo the Summers interview . I 'm not crazy . I am not crazy . Hey , Will . Whatcha doin ' ? I figured out this was where Buffy disappeared from what you told me , so do n't start jumpin ' to any conclusions . No jumping ' . Look , feet firmly planted . I 'm not feeling like myself right now . Sorry . Me too . Sorry . So , what have we found out so far ? Take a look at that ! Something sped outta here pretty damn quick to make that kind of tread mark . - This could have been made any time . - Yeah , but this was n't . That one . Whatever hit this hydrant hit it after it was made invisible . Betcha by golly wow that something was the same something that shot out of that alley . Black paint ? Buffy 's phantom van . We need to let Buffy ... Whoa ! There 's something there . It 's a pylon - one of those orange traffic cones . You should take it to the Magic Box . It might help you and Anya figure out what spell was used . - What about you ? - I got paint scrapings ... and the tyre mark . I 'm gon na find this van that 's been stalking Buffy . By the way , where is Buffy ? Oh , my God , the blood ! Look at all the blood ! Whatever beastie you are , I know you 're here . And I hurt beasties . Hey , watch it . A ghost , is it ? Go and haunt the living , like a good spook . - Buffy ? - I told you ... - Really ? We 'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents ' table and move your Uncle Rory to a table five near the bar . An , honey , we 're looking for invisibility spells here . Well , obviously I have n't found anything yet . At least , nothing that would explain why things near Buffy become invisible . Ew ! - Xander ... - What happened ? An unpleasant tactile experience , like putting my hand in pudding . Ew ! Like pudding , am I right ? Rice or tapioca - lumpy like that . We have to find Buffy . She 's got ta know . I do n't think Buffy will be broken up over a pylon . Anya , whatever 's happening to the pylon will probably happen to her . If we do n't find Buffy ... I mean , if we do n't figure out how this was done ... She 's pudding ? What do you mean , she 'll fade away ? The Slayer got slammed with a big-ass dose of radiation . Her cells are mutating ... - But would n't that kill her ? - Let me think ... Yeah . Wait a minute . We 're not killing anybody . Especially not Buffy . You guys are so immature . We 're villains ! When will you get that into your thick skulls ? - We 're not killers , we 're crime lords ! - Yeah . Like Lex Luthor . He tries to take over Metropolis , but he does n't kill Superman . Because it 's Superman 's book , you moron ! But Lex does n't kill him , does he ? Listen , Warren , you get that ray working and the first thing we 're gon na do is find Buffy and re-visible her before it 's too late . You got me ? Fine . Whatever you guys say . Spike ? Spike ? What are you doing ? What am I ... What does it look like I 'm doing , you nit ? I 'm exercising , are n't I ? Exercising . Naked . In bed . Uh-huh . Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs . Mini disaster area . You come here to criticise my housekeeping ? - No , no . I 'm looking for Buffy . - Have n't seen her . Well , you would n't . She 's come down with a slight case of invisibility . Yeah ? How did ... ? We do n't know yet . Anyway , she 's not at the house , and I really , really need to find her . Tell you what , I 'll ... take a peek around first chance I get ... and if we bump into each other , I 'll clue her that you 're on the lookout . After your ... exercises . Yeah , right . You know , kidding aside , Spike ... you really should get a girlfriend . That was bloody stupid . What 's the matter ? Ashamed to be seen with me ? Come on . He had no idea I was here . This is perfect . Perfect for you . What I want ... This vanishing act 's right liberating for you , in n it ? Go anywhere you want . Do anything you want . - Or anyone . - What are you talking about ? The only reason you 're here is that you 're not here . Of course . As usual , there 's something wrong with Buffy . She came back all wrong . You know , I did n't ask for this to happen to me . Not too put off by it though , are you ? No ! Maybe cos for the first time since ... I 'm free . Free of rules and reports ... - Free of this life . - Free of life . Got another name for that - dead . Why do you always have to ... I thought we were having fun . Yeah ... now . But sooner or later your chums will work out a way to bring you back to living colour . You need to go ... That 's cheating . I do n't believe this . He threw me out ? He threw me . Did I , like , fall into some backward dimension here ? Is this Bizarro World ? And after he 's always going on and on about being the only one that understands me . " We 're alike , you and me . Birds of a bloody feather . " Oh ! He 's so ... Hey , I 'm walking here ! Insensitive . That 's what he is . Willow ? Willow ? Dawn ? Hey , Dawn , come here . You wan na see somethin ' neat ? - There you are ! - Buffy ? Where are you ? I 'm invisible . Check this out . Whoo , whoo ! Unidentified flying pizza , comin ' in for a landing . - What are you talking ... - OK , not the most clever ad lib . - But , come on , points for spontaneity ! - Stop it ! Just ... stop . Sorry , Dawn . What did you think would happen ? You 're invisible , Buffy . I know . Xander and Anya are on it . Muldering out what happened . What about you ? Should n't you be working on it ? - Of course I ... - Do you even care who did this to you ? Or if you 're gon na be stuck this way ? You 're making jokes and flying pizzas . - I do n't think that 's ... - I ca n't talk to you like this . I ca n't see you ! - How can I talk to you if I ca n't see you ? - Dawn ! Dawn ! Buffy , it 's Xander . Where are you ? We got a new problem here . - Tell her ! - I 'm trying . We think whatever made you invisible is killing you . - Tell her about the pudding ! - Anya ! Buff , if we do n't ... if this is n't reversed , you 're gon na ... Let go of me ! Congratulations . You 're our first hostage . Dawn , I 'm going out to find Xander . If he calls ... Xander ? Just listen , Slayer . You do n't have a lot of time . Who is this ? You sound familiar . I 'm ... nobody . No one you know . We 've got your friend Willow , and if you do n't want anything nasty to happen to her , you 'd better meet us . Alone . Where ? Hey ! Stay still and you wo n't get hurt . - You OK , Will ? - Buffy ? - Where are the bad guys ? - All round you , Slayer , so do n't try anything . He 's bluffing , Buffy . There 's just three of them , I think . More than enough to cause serious carnage , right , guys ? - Guys ? Guys ! - Kick ! Use the kick ! I tried . He blocks it with his drunken-monkey fist ! Ooh , scary video carnage . Let 's continue in a less crowded area . Like over there . - Where ? - Over ... Follow me . Ow ! I 'm gon na guess , you 're the ones that did this to me ? - It was an accident ! - Who 's that ? - Nobody you know . - They 're the ones from your mystery van . Oh . You . So what annoying thing are you gon na do to me now ? - Save your life . Make you visible . - I 'm meant to believe that ? They told me everything , Buffy . Something 's happening , you 're ... - Fading away . I know . - I can fix that . - Pick up that air-hockey mallet . - What for ? It 'll give me a target to aim at . Now hold still and all your troubles will soon be gone . - You 're on the wrong setting . - What ? The gun - it 's not set for reversing the particle ionisation . - What 's she saying ? Buffy , he 's trying to kill you ! Willow ! Ow ! - OK , playtime 's over . - You have n't won yet , Slayer . No . That comes after I beat the snot out of you . You 'll have to find me first . There 's three of us , against just one of you . - You lied to us . - Fight her yourself . - I go down , we all go down ! - I promise , you 're all going down . We may not have your powers , Slayer , but you 'll find we are not so easy to ... Ow ! Get her ! Wait a minute ! Who 's biting my leg ? - Sorry ! Where is she ? - Here . She ca n't find us if we split up . - You go that way . - Which way ? - That way ! Over ... Just keep talking , boys . Ow ! Watch the chest hair ! I know that voice . I summoned the flying monkeys that attacked the high school ? - During the school play ? - He 's Tucker 's brother . - Yeah , he 's Tucker 's brother . - Oh . So you three have , what , banded together to be pains in my ass ? We 're your arch-nemesises ... ses . You may have beaten us this time , Slayer , but next time ... um ... next time ... Maybe not ! - It 's locked ? You were supposed to check it ! - I forgot . I give you my arch-nemesises ... ses . What 's goin ' on in here ? I got a bunch of scared kids saying this place is haunted ! Oh , my God , Buffy ! I know . They 're gone . I guess we should chase them . No , your hair ! It is adorable . Pretty neat , you finding the van . So , how did you manage to ... I do n't know how I got through this day . Well , the important thing is that you did . It 's a good first step . How are you doing , post-invisibleness ? OK . I still have to do some damage control from my giddy-fest . Dawn was pretty freaked out . The whole " taking a vacation from me " thing did n't work out too well . Tell me about it . Except ... when I got Xander 's message - you know , that I was ... fading away - I actually got scared . Well , yeah . Who would n't ? Me . I would n't . Not too long ago I probably would have welcomed it . But I realise ... I 'm not saying that I 'm doing back flips about my life , but ... I did n't ... I do n't ... wan na die . I guess . - Yay for us . - Yay .

The other day when I went out to buy that sweater I bought a house to match . Ha , ha . - Sweetheart , that 's unbelievable . - Ha , ha . Do I know how to accessorize or what ?  - You ca n't take all that stuff with you . - The hell she ca n't . Thanks , Daddy . SINGING " THEFRESHPRINCEOFBEL-AIR " THEME Were you or were you not supposed to be there at 11 p . m . sharp ?  I told you I had to drop Lisa off . Besides , I was there at 11:30 . Right . For 30 treacherous minutes I stood alone at the corner of Rexford and Olympic . Carlton , that 's Beverly Hills . Yeah , the bad part . 90211 .  You know , Will , lately you 've been completely unreliable . I just hope you do n't disappoint me this weekend . Yeah . You have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? Yeah , yes I do . This weekend . You know , Saturday and Sunday . How you constantly disappoint me . What do we always do the first weekend after the new year ? Your annual height check ? After that . This weekend is our yearly bros-in-the-snow getaway . Come on , Will . We 've gone on these trips the last four years running . I live for this weekend . Okay , Carlton , I am sorry . I forgot . All right ? I 'll go . Just go upstairs and wax your skis or your legs or whatever you wax . All right , I 'll forgive you this time . Oh , this is going to be grand . Ha-ha-ha .  Asking Miss Lisa for permission ? First of all , Benson , I ai n't got ta ask nobody for permission . Hey , Lisa . - Hey , sweetie . - Uh ... Oh , darn . Uh , I guess I 'll just have to go on an annual ski weekend to Mammoth with Carlton . Well , good , because when you 're not busy , you know you get yourself into trouble .  All right , baby . It 's a shame you ca n't come with us . Yeah , I wish I could . Well , wear your long johns .  Yes , dear .  Hey , I love you , baby . I love you , too . - All right . Bye-bye . - Bye-bye .  That was a pretty nasty fall you took there , Will . Fall ? Pfft . No , you must have been watching one of the other black skiers .  Oh , these weekends really get my adrenalin pumping . How about some hot cocoa ? Yeah , make mine a double .  Two cocoas please . One grande . Will , you remember when we first started coming up here ? Uh ... I remember now . This place is always fly , man . Wait till you see what I got planned for the rest of the evening . After we power down our cocoas , there 's a complimentary luge lesson . Followed by supper at 7 , then back to the room for some hot spiced cider and a Barbara Walters Special . Normally , I would ditch you on that last one but , uh , I 'm gon na let you in on a little something . Ever since I was like 7 , I had a mad crush on Barbara Walters . I thought I was the only one . How do you feel about Nancy Reagan ? Oh , see now you 're being just sick . Hi . Nice parka . Down ? Uh , no , it 's a poly blend . Mine 's alpaca . I 'm Angie Cobb . Look , Miss Cobb , I know what you 're up to and I 'm not interested . Oh . Well , good for you . Good for the both of you . Ha , ha . Wait a minute , baby . I do n't even know this guy . Geoffrey , admit it . - You 're going to miss me , are n't you ? - Oh , yes , Miss Hilary . In fact , I 'm going to go upstairs right now and have myself a good cry .  Wow , he 's even more upset about my leaving than I thought . I hope he does n't hurt himself . I ca n't believe it . My big sister 's moving out . Oh , Ashley , mi casa es your casa . You can come over any time you want . Except for Tuesdays when I shoot three shows and I really need my space . Oh , and Thursdays . I shop till about 9 and then I take a warm bath and read . Why do n't you come over on Mondays between 11:15 and 2:30 ? Hilary , I 'm in school . I drink another cocoa , I mess around , I have to let out a Hershey bar .  This is what life 's all about . I mean , look around us . Is this not the best ? Two guys together , beautiful surroundings , white snow , fresh air . God , look at those mountains . The hills are alive . You know , we should get away more often . - Me and you , you and ... - Lisa . Not Lisa . No offense , I know she 's your girlfriend , but ... - Hey , baby . - Hey . - What are you doing here ? - My boss did n't need me . So it was either stay home and study or come up here and be with my baby . Aw . Break it down one time . Ahh . Ha-ha-ha . - Hey , Carlton . - Nice to see you again , Lisa . I 'm so happy you invited me . You invited her ? Well , yeah . Well , kind of . Come on , Carlton , now , this does not mean that we ca n't still have a good time . Smile . Smile . - You can do it . - No . Look , this was supposed to be our special weekend . I do n't wan na share you with some woman . Listen , Carlton , just because Lisa 's here , that do n't mean we ca n't have fun , man . Listen , hey , we are gon na do every single thing that you have scheduled . - Promise ? - Yes , sir . - We 'll go luging ? - Absolutely . - We 'll go to the restaurant I picked ? - Oh , yes , sir . - What about Barbara Walters ? - I would n't miss it for the world . Carlton , come on , man , ai n't nothing changed . We are inseparable .  WILL : Oh .  Will , it was such a cold and lonely drive up here I just wan na go upstairs and get into a nice hot bubble bath . - You do know how to pour bubbles , right ? - Mm . Um , hold that thought . - Carlton ... - Oh , I knew it , I knew it , I knew it . - Oh , I 'm out of here . - Carlton . Where are you go ... ? Carlton , come on , man . What is wrong with him ? Um , nothing . Uh , baby , listen , why do n't you go ahead upstairs get the tub started , let Calgon take you halfway , and I 'll come take you the rest . Carlton , wait .  - Carlton . - Get out of my car . Carlton , this is not your car . Now I 'll never get to see that Barbara Walters Special . And she had Henry Winkler too . Carlton , listen , man . You made me miss Fonzie . - Carlton , look . - No , you look . No , slow up , deer . Do n't you try to sweet-talk me , Will . No , Carlton , in the road , a deer !    Oh . Oh . Oh , I do n't believe this . I know , these air bags are worthless . I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! I swear , God as my witness I will be in church first thing Sunday morning . Oh , wait , Sunday 's bad .  Oh . Okay , I 'll cancel , I 'll cancel . Your whole life does flash before your eyes . Which reminds me , you still owe me 20 bucks from three years ago . You want your 20 bucks ? Okay , here it is . - What are you talking about ? - It 's a 40-foot drop to that slope . Well , we ai n't going that way . I 'm climbing back up to the road . Will , that 's sheer ice . Happen not gon na . Back in Philly , they used to call me Spider-Man . That was just one of my nicknames . So this is it . This is how the Carlton Banks story ends . With a whimper .  Shut up , Carlton .  Help ! Echo ! Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho . Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hey . Hi-de-hi-de-Heidi-Fleiss . Daddy , is n't it great about Hilary ? When do you think I 'll get to move out ? Oh . Sweetheart , you know expressions like " when hell freezes over " ? " When the cows come home " ? " When donkeys fly " ? Pick one . Will , I want you to eat me . If I die first . You can stay alive by using my body for nourishment . Incidentally , the buttocks has the most meat . God , I hope I go first .  Ouch . God , man , my fingers are getting all numb . That 's how it starts . First numbness , then the sensation of needles on skin finally , right before death , violent spasms as your blood freezes and your heart locks up . No more Discovery Channel for you , man . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - What Carlton , what ? What ? - No , no , no ! What , Carlton , violent spasms ? Tell me what to do . I did n't get the insurance . - What ? - I put the car on my credit card and I did n't get the $6 insurance . You always wonder why they ask you to sign that waiver . Well , there it is . Damn , it 's cold . You know , Will ? I do n't have any friends . What are you talking about , Carlton ? You got plenty of friends , man . You think people are your friends but they 're only that because of what you can do for them . Except you , Will . I do n't do anything for you . Even when you make fun of me I know you 're doing it out of love . You have n't been doing that as much lately . What are you talking about , Carlton ? I just called you Thumbelina this morning . Yeah , but your heart was n't in it . Look , Carlton let me tell you something , man . Lisa , that 's my girlfriend and we 're gon na be together , man . But that does n't change the fact that you 're my best friend . Stumpy . I 'd cry , but my tear ducts are frozen . Look , Will , I 'm a much better skier than you . - Let me go . - Go ahead . You 'd let me jump like that ? Hey , hey , hey , who better to risk his life for me than my best friend , huh ? Huh ? Wait , Carlton . I think I see somebody down there . We 're saved .  Hello , up here ! I think he sees us .  What ? What did he say ? I think he said , " Do n't yell . " Do n't yell ?  Why not ?  BOTH : Avalanche !  - You do n't think anything bad happened ? - I 'm sure they 'll be back any second .   What was that ?  Hey , you know , you never know how brave you can be until you do n't have no choice . - Why do n't we make the most of it ? - I would like that , Carlton . There 's three of us now , we need to get another room . I have a room . Hey , is n't that great ? Now you and I can stay together and Lisa can stay with her . I ca n't believe it . How could you not take the insurance ? It only costs an extra $6 . Sweetheart , in honor of your new house we 've put together a little photo album for you . HILARY : Oh . Naugahyde . Wow . - You really went all out . - Ha-ha-ha . Just look at the pictures . Oh , look , here I am at Camp Gucciwanka . Ha . Camp Gucciwanka ? Oh , yeah , that 's Apache for " over-privileged . " I drew a picture of the family , and that 's you with the diamond . Oh . And , Carlton , you stay just who you are , I mean that . And , Daddy , do n't worry , I still have duplicates of all your credit cards .  Goodbye , little house . Goodbye , little yard . Oh , goodbye , little lamp . No , I could use this .  - One down , four to go . - Take it easy , Philip . It 's still about 13 years before our nest is empty . Oh . Hey , guys , listen , me and Lisa about to run to Roscoe , get a little grub . Uh , Carlton , you wan na go ? No , three is a crowd . - Come on . - Okay . - See you later . PHIL , VIVIAN ASHLEY : Bye . - Did you forget something , sweetheart ? - Um , not something , someone . I hate my life . ANNOUNCER : Yo , stay tuned for more Fresh Prince . 
@@5229241 Oh , dear , your chair 's got another big rip in the bottom . MARTIN : Where ? Hand me my reupholstery kit , would you ? Thanks . Oh , Dr Crane , do n't you look smart . I do n't feel smart . I 've let Roz set me up on another one of her blind dates . - Who 's the lucky woman ? - Oh , a friend from her aerobics class . Well , perhaps it wo n't be too bad . She 's 32 , has a terrific body , apparently thinks I 'm God 's gift to broadcasting . Well , at least you have one thing in common . When will you stop blighting the environment with this atrocity ?  My God , ca n't you see that it wants to die ? Let it go . You know , I keep having this dream where you say the same words , only I 'm in the hospital , and you 're slipping the nurse a 20 . - Dad , that will never happen . MARTIN : Thank you . I have medical power of attorney . - Hello , Frasier . We were in the neighbourhood for a pedicure and a seaweed wrap and we thought we 'd stop by . - Of course , the pedicure was for ... - Stop right there . There 's no way to finish that sentence that 'll make me proud . I have some wonderful news . I just signed a lease for an apartment in one of the most exclusive buildings in Seattle . - You do n't mean ? NILES : I do . As of next week , I will be a resident of The Montana . Niles , why would you even want to live in such a stodgy building ? When I applied there they treated me like riffraff . If you 're gon na ask and answer your own questions , what do you need me for ? The best part is I 'll never have to give my address again . From now on , I 'll simply be Dr Niles Crane , The Montana . DAPHNE : That 's a lovely building . Well , I hope you 're right . I have n't heard yet . Well , good night . - Hey , Frasier , you do n't think she ... ? - Just relax , Dad . It 's just her way of angling for more vacation time . But what if she is n't ? They 'd have to call me for a reference . Either way , she 's not going anywhere . Gosh , that 's uncanny , Dad . - What is ? - The way she 's taken with you . Look at that . She 's absolutely mesmerized . - She is not . - Oh , she is . She 's just playing hard to get . Go to Grandpa . Go to Grandpa . Go to Grandpa . Oh , hello , Grandpa . Oh , yes . Is n't she warm and cuddly ? I see I 'm going to have a tough time tearing the two of you apart . FRASIER : I 'm gon na go out on a limb . Just not cats or dogs . Well , then you 're in luck , because I do n't know what the hell this thing is . There 's no way that dog is moving in here with us . Please ? At least if she 's here , I 'll be able to visit her . I can not turn her over to strangers . She worships me . FRASIER : Oh , please . You must realize that that dog has no genuine affection for you . You only pretend that she does because she 's a canine substitute for Maris . That is the most absurd psychobabble I have ever heard . She 's high-strung , cold to the touch and ignores you . My God , stand her upright , take ten pounds off her , put her in a Chanel suit , what have you got ? - I 'm sorry , that 's ridiculous . - Is it really ? All right , here . - Hey , Frasier . - So how did it go with Rita last night ? - She did n't quite take to me . Oh , you 're just being hard on yourself like you always are . FRASIER : You tell me . Over appetizers , she suddenly realized she had a very early morning meeting , suggested that we skip the jazz club after dinner . People have meetings . When the waiter suggested a souffl ? that would take an extra 30 minutes , she said , " Oh , dear God , no . " She was probably on a diet . After I dropped her off at home , I noticed that she 'd left her suede jacket in my car . I called to offer to swing it by , and she said , and I quote , " Just keep it . " - What did you do to her ? - Nothing . God , Roz , I have had it . I 've even spent hours in the grocery store trying to look helpless in the produce department . That 's it . I 'm taking myself off the market . Frasier Crane has thumped his last melon . You know , Frasier ... Roz , Roz , please , I know what you 're going to say . I should climb back up on that horse . I 'm too great a catch to give up now . - No , I think you should give up . - What ? Well , I do n't really want to give up . I was just saying that to get your sympathy . Look , this happens sometimes . When you 're on a really bad streak , you start to get desperate . Women can sense that . They can smell it . - Smell it ? - Mm-hm . - Oh , honey , wake up and smell ... Well , yourself . You just need to air it out a little bit . And in my experience , the minute you stop looking , the perfect person falls right in your lap . Well , Roz , as much as I appreciate you comparing me to a dead squirrel in a heating duct , I think you 're wrong . - Hey , Roz . ROZ : Hey . - I got that research you 're looking for . - Great . - Hi , Dr Crane . FRASIER : Hi . Wow , you look really lovely today , Christine . It is Christine , is n't it ? That 's what it says on my driver 's license .  FRASIER : That 's very charming . God , I reek , do n't I ? NILES : - With inlay of Philippine mahogany . And we conclude our little tour back here in the living room . Oh , it 's very posh . It 's an antique fainting couch . My goodness , they had furniture for everything back then , did n't they ? Glad you made it . Niles , this precious little building is n't as exclusive as you think . Your doorman waved me right through . - Well , that 's because he knows you . - Oh , a fan of my show ? No , he lives in your building . So , Niles , what 'd you do about the dog ? Oh , I found a wonderful family to adopt her . Well , I 'm sure it wo n't take you long to adjust to being alone again . Actually , I wo n't have to . Follow me . There 's someone I 'd like you to meet . It was love at first sight . She 's very exotic , only eats every other day , and she 's so white , she 's almost blue . Well , I 'm getting nervous . That 's what he said just before he introduced us to Maris . BABY : I love you . She says that all the time . I love you too , Baby . I love you , Grandma . She 's still in transition from her last owner .  Let go of my shoulder . Let go of my shoulder . Do n't like that noise , do you , Baby ? Well , here , go to your food . Go to your food . Oh , good girl . Excuse me . Oh , you know , I 've always been fascinated by these birds that can actually learn how to talk . Oh , they ca n't talk . They just drill a few words into them at the pet shop , and then they never learn anything else after that . It is attractive , though . Yeah , well , that 's the way they are . Cute , but stupid . I sense a real battle of wits shaping up here . NILES : Thanks so much . Well , I 'm off to an auspicious start in the building . One of my neighbours got my mail by mistake . Look at those bills . What must she think of me ? But , Niles , everybody gets bills . Not at The Montana . They all have people . Yeah . Their bills go to their people . I want them to think I have people too . I used to have people , only they were Maris ' people . Niles , you keep this up , you wo n't even have the people who do n't care you do n't have people . It just proves how essential it is to make a good first impression when you move into a new building . Which is why I 'm throwing a dinner party Friday night for a few select residents . I 'll show them such a good time , there 'll be no question I belong . You know how I hate a crowded table . That 's quite all right . I 've taken myself off the dating circuit . Afraid I was getting a bit desperate . Well , I was a bit concerned when you called to ask if Gloria was our first or second cousin . Hey , Niles , you got ta see this . Your bird 's eating peanut butter . It 's even funnier than when Eddie does it . Dad !  Frasier , would you get that ? And pretend you 're my people . FRASIER : Hello . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I was looking for Dr Crane . I found some more of his mail . Oh , well , I 'm a Dr Crane . I 'm Niles ' brother . Oh , my gosh . You 're Dr Frasier Crane from the radio , are n't you ? - Oh , I love your show . - Thank you . - Stephanie Garrett . - Stephanie . - Oh , my God . - No , no , no , you were great . I mean , you were so good that I brought my husband back to see you the next night . Well , I mean , he was n't my husband then . Well , actually , he 's not my husband now . Oh , well , I 'm glad to hear that . Oh , no . That you came back , you know , the second time , not that you have an ex-husband . You know , I have one too . Well , no ... Ex-wife . - My God , is it getting warm in here ? - Yeah , a bit . - Well , it was nice to meet you . - Right . Wait . You know , Niles is having a dinner party on Friday with some of his enchanting new neighbours . Well , then , see you then . - I 'll look forward to it . - As will I . Roz was right . When I stop looking for the perfect woman , she lands in my lap . I hope you 're comfortable with that arrangement , because that 's where she 'll be seated Friday night . NILES : Bon appetit . Bon appetit . - Now you try it , Baby . Bon appetit . BABY : Bon appetit . What a quick little study you are . Birdbrained , indeed . You already know more French than my father .   Ow . Boy , if you do n't get used to that doorbell , we 're going to have to give you a serious manicure .  Coming . I 'm coming . Stop ringing . - Good evening . - Hello . Or should I say , " Avast ye , matey " ? I do n't have time for your badinage . I 'm only just setting out my place cards . He 's an investment banker from Amsterdam . Apparently , he handles a lot of Bill Gates ' money , so do n't say anything derogatory about the Netherlands or Microsoft . Damn , there goes my opening joke about the Dutchman trying to install Windows 95 . Stephanie 's over here . I 'm not next to her . See , Peter 's bringing a date , so I thought it would be better if you ... - What are you doing ? - I 'm putting Stephanie next to me . And throwing off my seating arrangement ? Niles , surely you realize that I 've spent a long time looking for a woman like Stephanie . Now , if you really want to impress these people , you 've got to get a little more atmosphere in the room . - I 'll light a fire . You dim the lights a bit . - Oh , that 's a good idea . By the way , be careful with that fireplace . It can be a bit ... Go to your perch . Frasier , this bird 's holding onto my scalp . L ... I ca n't pull it off . If you can pull off that jaunty beret you wore to brunch last Sunday , you can pull anything off . - I 'm sorry . Let me try to help . - All right , be careful . Let me see what I can do . Maybe I can just get the legs . - Ow ! Ow ! Stop it ! Stop it ! - It just does n't ... It 's stuck . Wait . I know . Get the lighter . Fire frightened it onto my head , fire will frighten it off . Let 's try that .  - It 's not working . - Yes , it is . - Stop it . Stop it . - Oh , all right . - Oh , here , the phone . - Oh , excellent , excellent , excellent . And whom do you suggest we call , a fez rental ? Come on , Baby . Go to your perch . Go to your food . Go to your bed . - Niles , do n't panic . Try to stay calm . - How can I stay calm ? I have six dinner guests arriving ...  Ow ! All right , listen . You go call the vet . I will take care of things out here . - Oh , hello . - Hello . Please come in . - I 'm not early , am I ? - No , no , not at all . - May I get you a drink ? - Yes , a white wine , please . - Oh , what a lovely table . - Yes . Yes , I noticed that we happen to be sitting next to one another . Good . Then I wo n't have to change the place cards around . Oh , well ... To the girl next door .  NILES : Ow ! What was that ? Well , I 'm afraid Niles probably burned himself on something . Do n't worry . He 'll be fine . Hello . Oh , please , do come in . I 'm Frasier Crane , Niles ' brother . I 'm Carol Larkin . My husband Alfred . This is our niece , Wella . A pleasure . Wella . Nice to see you . Welcome . Please make yourselves comfortable . I 'm just going to run into the kitchen and check on the bird . So you 've seen this sort of thing before . I see . - All right , well , thank you . - What did he say ? Well , he thinks she was traumatized by the fire and went into a kind of shock . He said we should n't try to force her off . We need to relax her . Fine , you take care of that . Try delivering that keynote speech you gave at the Psychiatric Association last spring . Everything all right out here ? - Will Dr Crane be joining us soon ? - Oh , yes , I believe so . Any minute now .  NILES : Ow ! - Oh , dear , is something wrong ? I keep telling him , " Get yourself a decent oven mitt , " but , you know ... Hello . Please come in . I 'm Frasier , Niles ' brother . - Peter Soutendeck . - Peter . - This is Elaine Hensley . - Elaine . Actually , your brother and I are well acquainted . Maris is a dear , dear friend of mine . - Really ? - Yes . So where is Niles ? Well , actually , he 's in the kitchen preparing dinner . He 's favouring us tonight with a lovely pheasant .  As you know , he is a stickler for freshness . BABY : Cute , but stupid . Listen , I ca n't stall them much longer . They 're starting to ask questions . The Dutchman 's date even knows Maris . - What ? Who 'd he bring ? - An Elaine somebody . Well , which Elaine ? Maris knows three Elaines . Oh , I do n't know . She 's very thin , she 's exquisitely dressed and dripping with attitude . Oh , like that narrows it down . I was afraid of that . It 's the bad Elaine . Maris ' oldest friend . Nothing would delight her more than report back to Maris that I threw a soiree with a cockatoo on my head . BABY : Bon appetit . - What was that ? - Bon appetit . Crab puffs for everyone . Bon appetit . At which point , the woman said to Churchill , " Sir , if you were my husband , I would put poison in your coffee . Yes . From Churchill . Well , can I freshen anyone 's drink ? Perhaps I 'll just bring the bottle around . I did n't realize that you were gon na have to play host all night . I mean , we 've hardly had a chance to talk , and I 'm afraid I 'm gon na have to make it an early night . - Oh , no , really ? - Yes , I 'm leaving for Paris first thing in the morning , and I was really hoping that we could spend some time alone . And so we shall . As of this moment , it 's just the two of us . I 'm completely at your disposal just after this . Elaine , can I get you something ? Actually , I just thought I 'd see what Niles is up to in there . Perhaps I could be of some help . Well , you know , you could pour the wine . Toss . You ca n't abandon me just because you 're hoping Stephanie 's as horny as you are . You 've got to help me . I suggest that first you get to the vet and have that removed . Are you mad ? I ca n't walk in there with this on my head . I 'd be the laughingstock of The Montana . You ca n't spend all night in the kitchen . Frasier , these people live for gossip . I 've only been here three days . Already I know that Peter 's a letch and Carol 's a lush . What do you think they 'll say about me ? I 've spent 45 minutes with these people . They happen to be very kind , understanding , and I think they 'll be very sympathetic to your problem . - Really ? - Yes . - You do n't think they 'd laugh at me ? - No , I do n't . I 'll go out there . But if they ridicule me , let it be on your head . Everyone , excuse me . There 's been a little mishap . Niles is going to have to go to the doctor . It 's nothing serious , he just has to have something removed . Niles . You see , his bird suffered a kind of trauma and has attached itself to the scalp , and we were just thinking that we 'd hate to cancel dinner , but ... Frasier , this is n't necessary . Let 's just go . Good evening , everyone . I 'm very sorry for all of this . Niles , you mean all this time you were hiding in there because of your bird ? Oh , you poor thing . You know , the same thing happened to my mother once , only with her cat . Now , that was a sight . Who has n't had an embarrassing moment at a party ? Look , I 've just spilled wine on my dress . Are you in any pain ? No , no , as long as no one rings the doorbell , I 'm fine . Well , you know , Niles , you seem to be relaxing a bit . Maybe the bird will relax and ... Should we give this another minute or two ? ALL : Yes . Well , all right then , who needs more wine ? Alfred , wine for you . And would anyone like cheese or a cracker ? No , no , Baby , guests first . Oh , Carol , that dress is absolutely smashing . - Why , thank you . BABY : Carol 's a lush . Did the bird just say something ? It sounded like it said ... BABY : Carol 's a lush . Where would a bird learn a phrase like that ? Birds today . You just do n't know where they pick things up . Well , shall we all join Peter at the table ? BABY : Peter 's a letch . BABY : Peter 's a letch . Is this your idea of a joke ? I 've had quite enough of this . Come along , Carol . No , please , people , do n't go . I did not teach the bird these phrases . I do n't know where it picked them up . You 'll stay , wo n't you , Stephanie ? BABY : Stephanie 's horny . Oh , my God , is that what you 've been saying about me behind my back ? No , I never said that about you . I said it about me . I 'm the horny one . All I said was , you 're very cute . Cute , but stupid . Well , thank you both for a wonderful evening . - Good night . - Please let me explain . I know we got off on the wrong foot , but we are going to be neighbours ...  - Well , thank you very much . - Oh , please . What have you lost ? The respect of a posh lush and a Dutch letch . Try repeating that , Baby . All right . I apologize . Thank you . Perhaps I can drive you to the vet now . Maybe we should take the service elevator . Oh , what 's the point ? I do n't think my reputation can suffer any more than it already has . I would n't be so sure about that , wearing a white bird after Labour Day . 
@@5229441 " March 1st . I 'm still confident today 's session in the capsule will be the last . I will be energized to full capacity . If my calculations are on track , Superboy will soon find out he 's not the only superhero in the world . What I 'm about to do , I do for her . " Hector ? Hector ? Hector Hornsby , you open up this door . All that money to put you through college , and what have you got to show for it ? Toys , a garage full of toys ! They 're not toys , Mother . And you did n't even finish your dinner . Why do I bother ? Why do I bother doing anything for you ? You are getting to be just like him . You remind me more of your father every day . He was a sorry excuse for a human being , and you 're no better . Mother , I have to concentrate . Could you please go away ? Do n't you talk to me like that . This is not a good time for you to be in here . " Once I begin to appear in public , people will forget all about Superboy " ? You ca n't read that , it 's private ! " Microboy will be the one they talk about . Microboy will be the hero everyone looks up to . " No one reads my journal , no one ! Hector , what 's all this rubbish about Microboy ? Who 's Microboy ? No one reads my journal . No one . Ah ! What are you doing , Hector ? No , Mother . Not Hector . Microboy . Since Dr . Zubar 's been away in Europe , you 've made some big improvements on the original design of his time machine . Well , the people here at Siegel institute have been very helpful . Let 's hope this test run succeeds . There 's the frog . Right on schedule . Yes , the micro-timer functioned perfectly . What 's going on ? I wish I knew . For days now , some outside force has been siphoning off vast amounts of electromagnetic waves all around us . Do you have any idea what 's causing the disturbance ? Not yet . So far , the power drain is focused on the mid-range of this spectrum , between 1 and 300,000 megahertz . Microwaves ? Precisely . I 've turned my body into a kind of battery . I draw microwaves out of the air and convert them into energy that I now have ... At my fingertips . Heat generation is just one of the tricks that I can do . You almost burned me , Hector . You do n't burn your mother . I did n't mean to . These powers - - what are they ? And since when do you think you have to be a hero like Superboy ? Since I met her . She 's the girl of my dreams , Mother . She 's in my drama class at school . I wan na marry her . So pretty . You ca n't be serious , Hector . Oh , Mother , do n't start up again with this , please ? You 're a tinkerer , Hector . You have an inventive mind , just like your father . And like him , you 're jinxed . You 're a loser . You 'll never amount to much . You 'll never know what it 's like to be a success . And you 'll never - - and I 'll never find real happiness . Is n't that right , Mother ? Mm-hmm . And let 's not forget about love . I 'll never find true love , either . It 's for other people . That 's why you 've got to get rid of that tanning booth , and I want you to forget all about this Microboy nonsense . Do you hear me , Hector ? I hear you , Mother . Oh , Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou , Romeo ? Deny thy father and refuse thy name . Shall I hear more , or shall I speak at this ? ' T is but thy name that is my enemy . And yet ... I know the sound . Art thou not Romeo , and a montague ? Neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike . Very good . That 's as far as we 'll go today . Hector , you were very focused . I 'm done , for thou hast - - you wan na act , kid . Act being a hostage . Take another step and I 'll kill him ! Ah , ah ! Aaahhh ! I bet that hurt . Are you all right , student ? Uh , I-I think so . What-what the hell are you supposed to be ? Microboy is my name . And catching criminals is my game . You 're under arrest . No way ! Andy , are you all right ? Yeah . Here he is , officers . And you tell that dirtbag when he wakes up in prison who sent him there . Yeah , Clark , you almost got the chance to meet Superboy 's competition . He saved my life and then just flew off . What ? You 're saying he flew ? Felix took some pictures . I wonder if I 'll ever get to thank him . You never suspected that of all the people , I would be ... Microboy . Microboy . Oh . So you think you 're a big shot now , huh , Hector ? Caught one crook and you got your picture in the paper . So do you , uh , think this Lana girl is going to think you 're a big hero now , hmm ? You have an inventive mind , Hector . But that wo n't change things . You ca n't fight fate . You 're always going to be a loser . Just like your father . A lifelong loser . Aaahhh ! Superboy , thank the stars you got to the airport in time . Well , the destruction this morning was the worst yet , but today , I have a strong hunch as to what 's causing these disturbances - - or , should I say , who . Microboy ? And I 'm afraid he 's craving more energy with each exposure . Like an addict . Precisely . But my readings show that his craving has shifted to the high end of the wave spectrum . Ultraviolet and gamma radiation , and x-rays ? That 's the bad news . The good news is that , knowing this , we may be able to predict where Microboy will go next to feed . The solar power station north of the city . Lana , this is a solar power plant . The energy that I draw here will make me invincible . And you 're gon na be so proud of me . Why have you done this ? Because I love you , and I knew that you would never love me back . So I gave myself these powers and this costume so I could be like Superboy . Well , Hector ... What I feel for Superboy , it 's got nothing to do with-with his powers or a cape . Love ... Real love ... Does n't work that way . Do n't be afraid . It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's just all this energy that I 'm absorbing from these solar activators . Ah , I see . She wants to be with you , Superboy . You 've got ta get away from this place , Hector . Who was I kidding ? I never had a chance with you . I should have listened to my mother . She knew I 'd never amount to anything , ever . She told me I was born to be a loser . A loser with nothing left to lose . Feel that , Superboy ? I 'm strong enough to create an energy field powerful enough to kill even you . But you 're not a killer , Hector ! Think again , Superboy . Superboy ! Lana ! Undo what you just did . I 'm dying , Lana . The energy 's killing me . I do n't wan na die alone . Hector ... You do n't wan na do this . They 'll find us together . Like Romeo and Juliet . It 's hopeless . If we could stop him from absorbing microwaves , perhaps he would survive , maybe even recover . But ... We 'll never know . What do you mean ? In this day and age , there 's virtually no place on earth totally free of microwaves . " In this day and age " ? Professor , you just hit the answer . No , Superboy , no , ab-absolutely not . No , no , it 's too dangerous . It may be the only chance that Hector has . Professor , if you wo n't program zubar 's machine , I 'll do it myself . Ha , I guess you would , would n't you ? I ca n't deny that I seem to be cured . But why take me back this far ? Why 1903 ? Think about it , Hector . In 1903 , electricity was still in its infancy . Oh , I see . There were no microwaves in the air . That means I can never go back , can I ? No . What about my mother ? I bet she 'll be better off without me . Would you do me a favor ? Could you say goodbye to Lana for me ? Sure . Thank you . One more thing . Where are we ? You 'll figure it out . But wilbur , we 're talking about sustained flight . Twelve seconds is nothing . One problem at a time , Orville . One problem at a time . Now how do we achieve lateral control when we have a rigid -- Excuse me . Have you ever thought of replacing these static wires with control wires for the wings ? That way the sail can-can warp and twist in flight . What did you say your name was ? Hector ... Hector Hornsby . Orville , is this what you need ? Yeah . Oh , thank you . Do I know you ? Oh , uh , Hector , this is our cousin , Julianne . Were-were you at the square dance last week ? No , I was n't . Hector , let 's talk about these control wires . - Oh , okay . - Now if we attach ' em on the inside of the wing right here - - and then we bring this one right on down here , we can control the sail . That would be good , that would be good . And get the lift . Captioned by Grant Brown 
@@5229641 Okay , I just got off the phone with the transit police . It 's the Number Nine train . It 's stuck between the 14th and 18th Street stations , and there was some kind of a fire . They put the fire out . No one was hurt , but there 's still about 35 people stuck down there . Listen up , everybody . This is what we 're going to do . Standard subway crisis . We know what to do , Dave . I did n't know we had a standard procedure for this . Oh , sure . We send a reporter to the scene . He asks the transit police if he can go in the tunnel , they say no , he says okay , I go on the air every eight minutes and say ... DEEP VOICE : Still no news on that disabled train . Business as usual . Let 's do it , people . Actually , Bill ... Yeah . I 'd like to try something a little different this time , okay  Okay . Let 's do it , people . Well , actually , Bill , seeing as I am the news director , I think we might try this . My plan is that we get a reporter in the tunnel for an eyewitness account and we be the first station to do it . BETH : Hey , Dave , I 'm not trying to be a downer , but they never allow reporters into the tunnel during an emergency . Well , that 's even better . That means we will be the only station with an eyewitness account . Do you have a contact at the transit commission  I have the transit commissioner 's number here . Great . Where 'd you get that  Directory assistance . I mean , we have to start somewhere . Now , Matthew 's already down at the scene trying to get access from there . Which he wo n't . And Lisa , you will be the on-air voice for this story . Thank you , Dave . Okay , Lisa , try this . Hi . How can I help you  Need you to sign for the new desk . Oh , what new desk  Okay , great . Just put it right over there . Uh , Beth , will you look through the file , see if you can get me anything at all on the -- Uh , Beth  What new desk  Matthew requisitioned a new desk , so I ordered it . Beth , what I want you to do is get Matthew on his cell phone and as soon as you have him , patch him straight in to me in here . Is n't this the point where everyone starts snapping into action  I have a question . Yes , Bill  I do n't have a new desk . Bill , that 's not a question . Relax , Bill . I 'm sure that our desks will be coming later , right , Dave  Can we talk about this some other time  Oh . Okay . Let 's talk about this now . All right , Catherine  If Bill gets a new desk , so do I . Bill 's not getting a new desk . Thanks for letting me down so gently . Can I have Matthew 's old desk  Joe , you 're an electrician . You do n't need a desk . Yeah , but I can get , like , 150 , 200 bucks for it . I got my van downstairs . You know , I could just ... Okay . Look , can we just discuss this desk situation tomorrow  We have a real-life crisis on our hands right now . Let 's not be distracted by a stupid desk ! Oh , baby . She is beautiful .  No , no , I understand that you have to put me on hold , but it 's just that I was already on hold before you put me on hold . Hi . Hi . Okay . Thank you . I gave it to you because you 're so darn cute . I 'm just kidding . Look , if you could just please let me talk to the transit commissioner just for five minutes . No , no , please , do n't transfer me over to the deputy transit commissioner . Ple -- Hello . Hi . Could you transfer me back to the transit commissioner 's office , please  Dave , Dave , Dave , Dave . Hi . It 's me again . Hold on , please . I just wanted to warn you , Mr . James is here . Whenever there 's a big news crisis , he likes to hang out , enjoys the chaos . Fine , fine . He brought one of his golf buddies . So try to look busy . I wrote it all down in the note so I would not interrupt you . Thank you , Beth . Well-- Dave Nelson . N-E-L-S-O-N . From WNYX - - Do n't mind us , Dave . Can you hold  Hi . This is where it all happens , Bob . News director 's office , crisis control central . Hi . I 'm Dave Nelson . No , no , no . Ignore us , Dave . We 're here just to soak up the excitement . Bob  All right . Hi . Yes , I 'm sorry . Where were we  No . No , no , that 's my fault . I guess I just assumed you were writing it down . It 's Dave Nelson , WNYX news radio ... Is n't this exciting  Here . This is how I like to eat them . Mm ! So , Dave . What 'd you dig up today , another transit employee whacked out on Mary Jane  No , sir . Wow ! Yeah . Is there anything more exciting happening anywhere in the station  Well , Lisa 's about to go on-air with an update , if you like . Whoo , let 's go check out that action . Come on , Bob . Yes . Yes . Yes . It 's about getting access to the tunnel . Well , I do think we have a shot in hell or I would n't have called , would I  What  Listen , why do n't you -- I 'm sorry . Can you hang on again  Look , Bill , like it or not , Lisa is doing all of the subway updates . I think it 's important that we have one voice for this story , but I 'll give you the next crisis , I promise , but for right now , the subject is closed . Could n't have said it better myself , chief . Good . All right . Hi . What  Yes . Can you hold again  Bill , is there something bothering you  This new desk of Matthew 's ... Bill , this is what we in the business call bad timing . Is it , Dave , or is this part of some shrewd plan  Yeah , Bill . That 's it . Yeah , yeah . I firebombed the Number Nine train so I could create a diversion to get Matthew a new desk . Hello  No , no , that was just a joke . Yes , yes , it was in poor taste , but I really think if you just -- Well , she hung up . Thanks , Bill . You see , it 's not the desk itself , Dave . It 's what it represents . And that is  Actually , it is the desk itself . Dave , Captain What's-his-name on line three . He says it 's urgent . Beth , there 's no one on line three . I know . I just said that to get rid of Bill . Oh , oh , thank you , Beth . You 're welcome . Oh ... Oh , Beth , you want a new desk , do n't you  Listen , Dave , I 'd like to buy the staff lunch today out of my own pocket . Oh , thank you , sir . That 's very generous of you . Well , it 's all about morale , Dave . What with this subway crisis , a nice free lunch will make everybody feel better . You want to phone that in for me , Beth  You got it . Yeah , but first , get me the transit commissioner . You got it . I applaud your misguided enthusiasm , Dave , but for now , let 's focus on something within our grasp ... Like lunch . And here 's Lisa Miller with more on the derailed subway train . Lisa  Thank you , Catherine . Hi , guys . Hi , Matthew . Did they let you into the tunnel  No , of course not . Free lunch today . Whoo ! Whoo ! Oh . Finally . What  What 's going on , guys  Nice desk . Thanks . Is it ... new  Yeah . It 's great , is n't it  Yes , indeed , this sure is a real nice desk . You know , it 's weird ... Because I already kind of miss my old one , you know  So now he wants his old desk . Why do n't you talk to Dave  I 'm sure you can have both .  Hey , Matthew . What  Come on . You 're coming with me . What did the transit commissioner say  Well , it 's impossible to get anything done over the phone , so I 'm going to his office and state our case in person . How long has Matthew been lobbying for a new desk  Well , there was no lobbying . They do n't really need to know about our dinner . So , dinner and a desk . What 's next , you 're going to get him a pony  What are you talking about , Bill  Come on , Matthew . Let 's go . Hold on , Dave . Before you go , you 'd better take this . Right . Go on . Hello . Yes , it is . Huh  Who is this  Oh , that 's my pal , Tony Palmer , at Desk Emporium . Tony , what 's -- Tony-- No , no , Tony , I 'm not in the mood to bargain . Hey , Dave , there 's a man calling from that derailed train . He 's on a cellular phone , and he sounds real . Tell him to hold . Got to go , Tony . Hello . Yes , yes , this is Dave Nelson . I 'm the news director here . Now , sir , are you really on the train  Great . No . But , sir , I 'd like to put you on the air if that 's all right with you . All right  Okay . Take this up to Lisa in the booth , please . Now , sir , I 'm just going to have to put you on hold , and then patch you through and you 'll be on the air . Okay , thank you , sir . Dave , honey , I 've been to Desk Emporium , and their stuff is crap . I 'll bear that in mind , Catherine . You do that . A new development on that stalled Number Nine train in Chelsea ... Mr . Frank Silveri , a passenger on that train , has called WNYX on his cellular phone . Mr . Silveri , what is the mood on the train  Yeah , this is Tony Palmer at Desk Emporium . Are you in the mood to bargain  Hello , Mr . Silveri  Mr . Silveri  Mr . Silveri  Mr . Silveri ... Great . Matthew ! Let the elevator go , Matthew . You just never know when one of those is going to come by , you know  They 're so ... slow . Okay , listen ... Everyone seems sort of distracted today by something , so let 's just take a few minutes to get it out so we can focus on the work at hand . Who wants to go first  Bill  Well , actually , I do have a thing or two on my mind , but I 'd much prefer to discuss them over dinner some night . Unless Matthew has you all booked up . Bill , if you 'd like to have dinner sometime , that would be my pleasure . Actually , I 'm very busy this month . Yeah , Dave  Yes , Beth  Let me just give you the lowdown , if I could . I think what 's happening is that everybody 's getting really upset because you and Matthew have become best friends so fast . Ah ! Yes , it is . Now , I am sorry if you 've all gotten the impression that I like Matthew more than the rest of you . That is simply not so . Well , you do n't have to make it sound so implausible . All right , they pulled the train about 50 feet , but then it stalled again -- Lisa , not now . I know I 've only been here a couple of weeks and you do n't really know me that well , but I 'm sure as you get to know me , you 'll realize I 'm very a fair and just person . All right , why do n't you guys continue to discuss the desk , and I 'll sit in here and single-handedly broadcast the news  It 's a deal . Lisa , it 's not really about desks . Yes , it is . There seems to be some confusion about the fact that I had dinner with Matthew . Once . Or twice , maybe . Two dinners  This is unbelievable ! Beth , is Sergeant What's-his-name still on line four for me  No . I 'll take it in here . No desk , no dinner ... Land of opportunity , my ass ! Dave , how did you get an appointment with the transit commissioner  I did n't . I 'm just going to go down to his office and figure out the rest from there . Is this one of those plans that involves somebody dressing up in a fake nun outfit  No . Oh , because I have one at home . Good luck . Oh , thanks , Lisa . Oh , you two probably want to be alone right now , so I 'll just ... Beth ... Look , I really wish you had n't mentioned the dinners . I know . I 'm sorry . It just slipped out . I know , but those are the kind up slip-ups we really ca n't afford . Mm . That looks good . You want some  No , no , I do n't have time . Just take a little piece . No , I really do n't have time . No . Come on , you have to eat something . Come on . No . If that 's what it takes to get a new desk , I do n't even want one . Okay , from now on , we probably should n't feed each other in public . Lisa . Dave , could I see you in the can for a minute  Shrimp , Dave  I 'm ... full , sir . Uh , you think we could make this quick , sir  I really have to get down to the transit commission . You want to tell me a little about the morale problem out there  Uh , well , everyone 's under a certain amount of pressure , you know , what with this subway story and all . No , I will not accept your resignation . Well , I-- I-- I was n't going to say that . I was just going to say that I made a small error in judgment . A small error in judgment ... What exactly would that be , Dave  Would that be Matthew 's desk or the dinner with Matthew or the dinner with Lisa or the second dinner with Lisa  Okay , I made three or four small errors in judgment . Oh , they were n't errors , Dave . They were decisions , and that 's your job . No , the only error I see is that you 're letting your people push you around and make you second-guess your decisions . Of course you 're right . And now you 're letting me do it . You want my advice  Yes . Well , I 'm not going to give it to you . Listen , Dave ... I 'm sure you 're going to make the right decision on this . Well , then , what are you doing standing here watching me eat lunch in the can  Exactly . Are you coming , sir  Oh , I kind of like it in here . If you see Bob , tell him to bring me a little soy sauce , will you  Dave , Dave , what did the transit commissioner say  He would n't talk to me . What happened  Well , I walked straight into his office and sat down and said I would not leave until he gave us full access to the tunnel . And at what point did the security guards show up  Oh , about two minutes later . But before they got there , I grabbed this off his desk . You stole the subway commissioner 's tunnel pass  I borrowed it . We 'll mail it back when we 're done . Now go . Let 's not get bogged down with details , okay  Now , Beth , go to the booth , tell Lisa as soon as Matthew calls in to patch him - - What are these  BETH : New desks . Where did these come from  Scandinavia . Thank you . I 'm sorry about all that stuff I 've been saying behind your back today . Good job , Dave . You really know how to keep those troops happy . I do  Shh ! Dave , I told them you ordered the desks for them . I mean , that 's the direction you were headed in , right  Mr . James , my office now , please . Coffee , Dave  Good job , Dave . It takes a big man to crumble under pressure so fast . Mr . James , this is really not how I wanted to handle this situation . Now I have a staff that thinks if they complain enough about anything , I 'll cave in , and that is not true . Now , I 'm going to have to ask you to return those desks . Oh , I love the fire in your eyes . Sir , if you ever come in here and undermine my authority -- Easy , Dave . I do n't love it that much . Anyway , you 're going to have to handle this desk crisis by yourself . I got to go . Matthew , what are you doing here  Should n't you be in the tunnel  Yeah , I know , I know , I know . I was headed downtown , and I started thinking about things , and , oh , I just feel awful about this desk situation . Forget the desk . You know , it 's not even really about the desks , though . It 's about ... You know what  I am fine with the fact that your new favorite is Lisa . No . I 'm kidding . I love her . Lisa 's great . But , uh , I just feel a lot of resentment from the rest of the staff , you know , here , and what I was thinking is we could have some kind of fake fight in front of everybody -- What  Not a hitting fight . You know what I mean  Matthew , I want you to get out of my office . I want you to go downstairs , get in a cab , and get to that tunnel , and get me something I can put on the air . I just think if we work this out -- I do n't care what you think . Just get out of here . Okay ! Why are you yelling at me  I am not yelling at you , but in about five seconds , I will be ! LOWERED VOICE : Okay . Good job . Now , listen , are you and Lisa having dinner tonight  Because if not , I 'd like to even up that dinner score . You know what I mean  I 'll call you from the tunnel . Ladies and gentlemen , clean out your desks . They 're going back . LISA : In just a moment , we 'll be going to WNYX reporter Matthew Brock with an exclusive eyewitness report from the subway tunnel . Great . Now , this just goes to show you that sometimes , if you just push a little bit harder , you get -- LISA : Matthew , what can you see  Lisa , there 's really not much to see . Um , it 's pitch-black ... Very smoky , I 'm standing in about three feet of water . I can see some flashlights about 20 yards away , but that 's about it . Anything more you can tell us  There 's not much more to tell . Um ... Hang on . Hang on . Is there anything more you can tell us , Matthew , anything at all  Again , Lisa , pitch-black , very smoky , three , three-and-a-half feet of water . Back to you , Lisa . I did n't say it 'd be the most exciting thing in the world . I just said we 'd get it first . Well , look at it this way . If something explodes down there , Matthew will be right on top of it . Dave , on behalf of the whole staff , I want to apologize about that desk thing . I know we got a little silly . Oh , Bill , that 's all right . Say , I do n't want to nitpick , but do you have any idea when we 're going to get our old desks back  Oh , you know , we 're still working on tracking those down . Dave , did you mean for the movers to take the conference table also  No , that was another miscommunication on my part . Joe , please . Think about it . I 'll be down in my van . Well , I 'm sure my wallet will turn up somewhere . Well , boss , you sure showed them . Yeah , I guess I did . Can I get you anything else  How about a chair  That 's kind of a tough one , boss . Yeah . Thanks anyway . Okay , everybody 's signed up , and I think I have it scheduled . Okay , on Monday , you 've got dinner with Bill . He requested some kind of fancy French cuisine . Fine . Okay , on Tuesday , you have dinner with Catherine . She requested some kind of fancier French cuisine . Fine . Okay , after dinner with Catherine on Tuesday , you are going to meet Joe at the Garden for the Knicks game . He will pick you up in his van . Great . Okay , and then on Wednesday , you 're going out for sushi with some guys from payroll . I 'm very excited , Dave . Are you all right  Yeah , I 'm just exhausted . I ca n't wait to get into bed . Okay . Good night . Dave , just the guy I was looking for . Care to join us for dinner  Yeah , it 'd be a pleasure . I 'm a vegetarian . Yeah  Great . No , Beth , it 's been , like , 15 minutes . Yeah , but ... Yeah , but ... Every eight minutes is what they told -- It 's just very dark down here , and I do n't even think there 's anybody left . Guys  Yeah . Oh !  Hang on .  Beth  Okay .

Would it have killed you to do something for me for once ? - You took their side . - I have to stop helping you . You have to start helping yourself .  Are you gon na walk me home or what ?  Look at that . Do n't you think you should get some sleep before Sam 's put-in rehearsal in ... Oh , God ... Three hours ?  - I should go . - Yeah You do n't have to ... You look terrible . I think you said everything you needed to say to me last night . I know , I know . I was a total ass . I always am . I ruin everything . I told you that when you met me . And that 's what you say to make it okay . I do n't wan na hurt you anymore . All right , just tell me , what do I need to do to be the person that you saw in me ? Because when you look at me like that , I ... I know that 's who I really am . Karen , you okay out there ? - Oh , okay . - Jimmy ! Jimmy ! No ... It 's Kyle . Leave a message . Hey , it 's Tom . Um , I thought we were gon na meet up last night , but , uh , I never heard from you . Listen , if you 're not interested , uh , I guess I 'll understand , but just let me know .  Oh , my God ! I 'm going to delete this and re-record the message . Sorry ! Sorry we 're late ! The line at Starbucks was atrocious . Um , the line was fine . She had to stop and sign autographs and pose for pictures . She did everything short of bless a baby . - I did that yesterday . -  Oh , good ! You 're all here . Everyone ready to talk Tony ? Yeah , yeah ! Where 's Julia ? Yeah , uh , how are you guys doing after last night ? We 're fine . Let 's start without her .  What 's this ? A declaration of war from Tom . It 's a move to dissolve our partnership . Really ? It lists every name of every title we have ever optioned , including Gatsby . So he 's gon na tie it up for months , so you ca n't do it ? For him to move this fast , he must be really angry . If I pull this play , I 'll lose my job . I know . Look at this . Right back where we were 15 years ago ... My fate in your hands . Not mine , Tom 's . You will talk to him , right ? Reason with him ? Look , I may have burned you 15 years ago , but I 'm not gon na do it again . And I wo n't let Tom do it either . As we get closer to the Tonys , things are looking up for Bombshell . Imitation of Life is closing , which is n't a very good omen . Uh , Harold and Maude is struggling to retain the magic it had on the West End . And if Road House gets a nomination , I 'm gon na retire .  Drood and Pippin are contenders . No , not for best musical . They 're revivals . - I meant for directing . - Ah , ah , ah ... Downtown . So it 's official , sweetie . We 're the show to beat . And the key to staying that way is marketing . Subways , billboards ... This fabulous ad that you took out in the times . I did n't place a full-page ad in the Times . Then who did ? Jerry . Do n't get upset . We need all the help we can get . Not from him we do n't . That is a great ad . Look at that . You 're up there twice . Yeah , but supporting for Liaisons ? We closed in a week . With glorious reviews for you . You were a bright light in a bad show . Do n't think the nominating committee wo n't notice . But that puts me up against you . That 's right .  It would be embarrassing to beat my own daughter . Kyle , that was fast . Guess I still got it . " He 's no good for you , you know that . And you are ? Oh , God . What do we tell everyone ? We do n't have to tell them anything . - Tom . - Hey ! What 's wrong ? Um ... I called , uh , Kyle this morning . We ... Well ... Uh , he called me back , but it was n't him . It was the police . He got hit by a car last night . - Oh , my God . - Shh . He 's gone .  Smash 02x14 The Phenomenon Original Air Date May 4 , 2013 Kyle : I wish I knew how to fix this . Because Amanda 's death does not work . - We 're missing something . - Like what ? Like , um , like a chance for the audience to grieve . Um , a tribute or a candlelight vigil . Maudlin . She ca n't just die . You wan na know she mattered . You do ? When I was in school , we went to a show the night they dimmed them - for Wendy Wasserstein . -  And I just thought it was such an elegant and beautiful gesture . Um , could she sing another number even though she 's dead ? Ha , you know , I knew that was terrible , - even as I said it . -  She ca n't . But he could . The song she stole from him . The Love I Meant To Say ? She dies in the arms of the man who loved her , as he sings the song that brought them together in the first place . That would be incredibly moving . Yes , it will . You 're good at this , Kyle . You keep having ideas like that , they might just dim the lights for you yet . And that 's all we know for now . How you doing ?  I do n't care about me . I 'm worried about them though . I can ... I can do it . I 'll call them . No . We 'll do it together . Come on . Hey . I tried Jimmy . He 's not answering . Maybe you should try him . Yeah , if he 's not picking up for you , I do n't think he 's gon na pick up for me . Hi . So what do we do about tonight 's performance ? We cancel , obviously . Are you sure ? Uh , yeah , I think " The show must go on " is n't apropos at this particular moment , Scott . Sam has n't even had time to rehearse . Everyone 's devastated . I 'm not sure anyone is in a position to perform . But Hit List is Kyle 's show . I mean , I ca n't think of a ... a better way to honor him . Absolutely not ! I 'm not turning this into a bloody requiem ... let 's go call the ticket holders . Where are you going ? There 's something I need to do for Kyle . Such a tragedy . So young . Too young . We need to be very sensitive about this . We do n't wan na be silent , but we do n't wan na look like we 're jumping on any kind of grief parade either . Tony Vot ... Agnes , I think we need to take a break from the Tony campaign for today . Of course .  Julia ! I 'll leave you two . - I 'm sorry for your loss . - Thank you .  That 's why I 'm here .  Kyle lived for Broadway . I wan na try and get him a little piece of that dream , get the lights of the marquees dimmed tonight . It 's only awarded to Broadway veterans . I know , I know . I can reach out to a couple of people , but ... I know what they 'll say . Thank you . - He 'll turn up . - He was wired this morning . He ca n't find out the wrong way . It 's okay , we 'll tell him . As gently as possible . And whatever he needs , we 'll be there for him no matter what . Thank you , Derek . Do n't thank me for doing the right thing .  Jimmy . Yeah , yeah , it 's me . The guy that ruined your show . Well , wrote it , then ruined it . But who really cares about that part , right ? Do n't freak out . I 'm just getting my stuff , and then you 'll never ... have to see me again . I promise . God , you still do n't know ? Know what ? What , how much you guys probably hate me ? Like , how disappointed Kyle is ? ' Cause trust me , I know . He kicked me out . He was hit by a car last night . What ? Okay , come on . That 's screwed up , Blake . Jimmy 's here . Come quick . Where is he ? We told him , and he just left . You let him leave ? What was I supposed to do , block the door ? If he needs to be alone , he should be alone . No , that 's exactly what he should n't be . Kyle : What are you doing up ? I was about to ask you the same thing . Ugh . I have this thing where when I have an idea , I have to write it down immediately , or it 's gone . And what idea did you have ? Um , I always wanted to put these transitions between songs in Hit List . Sort of , um , social media subtitles to walk you through the story behind the story . You have to put the pen down at some point . I had to with Bombshell . Oh , really ? ' Cause I have notes .  Oh , do you , now ? Well , one , actually . Okay , in At Your Feet , when Gladys takes Norma Jeane to the Chinese Theater , why does she have to just leave her there ? ' Cause that 's the way it happened . Well but it 's sad , it 's , like , right there , the second number in the show , this melancholy chord . It 's the truth . And sometimes the truth is too hard . Sometimes , you wan na remember things better than they actually were . Which is what I think Marilyn wants to do when she remembers her past . Why do n't you come back to bed ? I still have a little more .   At Your Feet . Feel free to sing along .  What did you think ? Tom ? Tom ?  Julia ... I am so sorry . We all are . I really appreciate that . I almost did n't come here ' cause ... Talking about business at this moment just feels ... wrong . - Maybe we should postpone . - No . I mean , the sooner we get it over with , the better . I do n't know what 's happening to you , Tom . If you 're trying to stop me from working ... - Stop you ? - I promise ... I will fight you . This is gon na help you . Julia , if you wan na Gatsby , we have to dissolve the partnership , so you can re-option it on your own . Right now , thanks to you , I hold half the rights . But you do n't wan na be running every little decision you make through me . The sooner we separate it , the better . For you . And me . Oh . So ... Was that everything , or is that it for today 's installment of " Tom the Monster " ? Uh , no , that 's it . Thanks . All right , then . Cathie , can you find Linda for me ? There 's something I wan na take a look at . Mmhmm .  Wait , wait , wait , wait . Whoops . Well ... Oof . Should I duck ? You know , I was n't very happy about that . I do n't appreciate these little stunts of yours . That 's not a stunt . I put a lot of money into Bombshell , and I have a lot more . I wan na do something with it , something that will make a difference . I knew you 'd say no if I asked . Well , you have n't even tried . All right . Do you want more money ?  Of course not . I went into the wrong business . I should 've been a psychic . Bombshell is mine , Jerry . And I 'm gon na take it all the way to the Tonys without your help . Stay away from my show . Am I clear ? And here I thought the ice between us might be melting .  No , it 's as cold as ever . - I ca n't believe it . - It 's amazing .  - Julia . They want the show . - How did they even find out ? - Who knows ? Maybe we should go on tonight . Maybe it 's what everybody needs . I know I 'm probably the hundredth person to ask you this today , but how you doing ? Are you holding up ? Oh , I have to . Not with me . There are ticket holders lined up outside . We canceled the show , but they turned up anyway . What are you gon na do ? I have no idea .  I 'm sitting in the kind of place that I never thought I 'd go back to ' cause of a sweet kid who ca n't be here to enjoy the rest of it . You know I 'm good at putting on a front , but ... I 'm not good at caring this much . You 're going to put it on , and I 'm gon na be there for you . have n't you got a show tonight ? I think I 'm feeling a tickle in my throat .  You 'd do that ... for me ? I would . Okay , everyone . Can I have your attention , please ? I think we 've all had a chance to honor Kyle in silence , and now , we need to honor him up on that stage . It seems it 's what the people want . So we 'll do a concert , okay ? Just the piano , music stands . That way , you 'll know what you 're doing . Thank you . What about Karen ? Is n't she here ? Where is she ? I do n't know . All right , okay . Just give me a minute . Excuse me , guys . Yeah . I ca n't find him . Karen ... There 's just one last place I got ta check , somewhere Kyle told me he used to go . ? It 's show time , let the dream begin . with each star who 's ever been . step inside the footsteps that you should ? Fol ... All : ? fol ... ? - ? low ... ? all : ? low ... ? - ? in ? all : ? doo wop . so I leave you in the best of hands . in this most Chinese of wonderlands . your dreams will truly be complete . when the stars that you 're wishing on are . at ? all : ? at . your feet . ai n't she sweet ?  That was a really nice change , by the way . - Yeah . - What made you think of it ? - A friend . - Mm . What happened to Ivy ? When did she call out ? She went home sick an hour ago . Ah . Of course . Jimmy ! You 're not thinking of doing something stupid , are you ? No . Then come down . Jimmy ! Fine . I 'm coming up . What are you ... no ! What are you doing ? You should n't be sitting up here . Yeah , well ...  Neither should you . It 's my fault . You know , he 's dead because of me . No , he 's not . It was an accident . But he was coming to talk to me , Karen . I ca n't imagine what you 're going through . I ca n't even believe it happened myself , but ... But what ? What ? You gon na try to make it better ? Is that what you think you 're doing here ? I 'm just trying to help . Why would I ever let you help me ? Is this about Derek ? Nothing happened . Okay , I stopped it before it did . I ... I wish I was n't , but I am . I love you , okay ? You should n't love me . I do n't deserve it . Come back with me . Come do the show . - I can't . - Yes , you can . - You need to . - No , no , I do n't . Jimmy , I know you . Do n't throw everything away . No matter what you do , it 's not gon na make it hurt less . Come and face what happened . We can deal with it together , you and me . I ... I 'm already late . I have to ... I 'm gon na go . Okay ? I 'll see you there ?  I ca n't believe everyone showed up even after you called to cancel . We didn't . - Did n't what ? - Cancel . Scott said you changed everybody 's mind . Julia , I was just coming downstairs to stand next to you . I know what you did . I 'll see you both downstairs . - You lied . - No , I did n't . Yes , you did . And you used me to do it . Saying I turned the cast around , so the show would go on ?  You exploited that poor boy 's death , and for what ? For him , for his show . For yourself , to keep your job ! It is not my fault that this happened . But if it keeps his work alive , why should n't we do this ? You saw what was happening out there . We 're a phenomenon . People are going to remember this night forever . Julia ... You know how much I need this to work . I hope it does . He 'll be here . - Look , we 're late as it is . - Derek , five more minutes . Karen . He 's not coming . Okay . Okay , guys , um ... Look , I know things are pretty intense right now , and , um ... I know that going out on that stage might feel like a mistake . But I assure you , it is not . There 's a lot of people out there that wan na hear what you have to say . And more than that , they wan na hear what Kyle had to say . and you guys ... you 're the only ones that have the power to tell them . So ... do him proud .  Remember when this place used to be cool ?  Now , it 's just a bunch of condos . - Focus on your work . - Why should I ? It 's not like anything 's gon na come of it . Oh , my ... Yes , it is ! How can you be so sure ? I 'm not . I just pretend that I am .  Hey . You know what ? Maybe we should set a scene here . It 's kind of our place , you know ? What about when they meet for the first time , when Amanda tries to kill herself and Jesse stops her by singing The Love I Meant To Say ? Yeah . Yeah , and then when she gives it all up to be with him , they come back here right before she dies . Are you sure she has to die ? Musicals usually have happy endings .  Not the ones you like . You 're right . Then she must die ... Ha . So that your character can learn something . ? I 'm high above the city . I 'm standing on the ledge . The view from here is pretty . and I step off the e ... ? do n't do it ! Okay , so let 's do it . Yeah . Okay . He wants to do the song . what_do youthink ? Ca n't wait for act two , right ? Yeah , it 's good . It 's really good . I 'll just admit it 's a little strange for me . Um , ' cause she 's better ? - Karen , I 'm kidding . - No , you 're not . -  - That 's so rude . Hey , um , did Jimmy talk to you ? I told him not to . I thought it might scare you away . - It didn't . - I 'm glad . Are you ? ' Cause sometimes I feel like you think I 'm in the way or something . Maybe a little , at first . But then I saw how happy you make him . And , um ... Maybe you can fix what I could n't .   The show was amazing . Thank you . Technically it was n't all me . Wow . That might be the first time you 've ever said something like that .  How does it feel ? What happened with us ? One minute , we were hanging out , and then you were gone . Derek , I do n't think right now ... Please just ... I need to know . The night of my birthday ... I know the only reason you came to see me is because Karen rejected you . Karen ? Wow , okay . Um , well , there 's nothing going on there . I was at her apartment the whole of last night , and I slept on the couch because of you . I just came as a friend . That 's it . Do n't walk away from me because of Karen . It 's not Karen . It 's you . You 'll always have a Karen . - This was a great idea , Tom . You are definitely not a monster . Not today , at least . Jerry ! What are you doing here ? I saw Hit List tonight . Scott invited me . Did you like it ? I think it 's a great story . So do I . And also , I was thinking what a lovely gesture that was , putting the ad in the paper . Thank you . You , thanking me ? To what do I owe this ? Well , the reminder that life is shorter than we think it is . Does this mean we 're friends again ?  No . But you can be a friend to Bombshell ... If the money 's still on the table . Oh , I 'm sorry . That money 's no longer available . I committed it to something else . - To what ? - To Hit List . I 'm moving it to Broadway . We start previews at the end of the month . What are you doing after this ? Do you wan na go somewhere to talk ? Um ... Y-you know , I ca n't . Okay . Maybe tomorrow ? Yeah , I mean , I just have a lot to deal with . Are are you mad at me about something ? No . No , of course not . What about what you said to me this morning ? You guys do n't have glasses . Uh , actually , no , I 'm not drinking anymore , so ... You can have one . Go ahead , celebrate . I mean , you 're going to Broadway , right ?  , chuckles - Here we go . - Okay . Okay , can you hold this ? Yep .  . Tom : Well , we could n't get all of Broadway to dim but ... they ca n't stop us from using our own house . To Kyle . All : To Kyle . 
@@5230141 Matthew , turn off the TV , dinner 's almost ready . Okay , dinner 's ready . Wait , submarine sandwiches again ? This is , like , three days in a row . What 's going on ? Hey , are you sleeping with the guy at Quizno 's again ? No , I did n't sleep with him , we just flirted . He touched my cheek when he gave me my Sun Chips . And he gave me a free punch on my card . Is there anyone who has n't punched your card ? Quiet . I am on a quest . I have to find that sandwich I had last month . I am telling you it was the best sub I 've ever eaten in my entire life . So you have no idea where the sandwich place was no cross street , nothing . No , somebody else was driving . I had low blood sugar . And it was raining . Or I was crying ... something . I do n't know . I think it started with an " S . Oh , no ... God , this is n't it . Oh , this is disgusting . I ca n't eat this . Really . Mmm . This is definitely not it . Hey there . - Hey . - Smells like onions in here . That guy at Quizno 's still punching your card ? No , he touched my cheek . You do n't know anything about romance . Hey ... Hi , sweetie . Look at you . You look so handsome . Oh , just like a tiny used car salesman . I 'm wearing my church clothes . You sure are . What ? Dad and New Christine took me to church . You took him to church ? Hey , who wants to change the subject ? Yeah , I belong to the First Methodist Church on Helm , and today was our autumn festival . There were games and songs . And all these nice people that were happy to see me . I love church . Richard , he loves church . New Christine has woman problems . Richard ... I do n't have woman problems . Sure you do . You got ' em bad . We got to go . Hold it , hold it . Ritchie , you know what ? Why do n't you go upstairs and change into your play clothes while I talk to Daddy . - Okay . - Okay . - Bye , Dad . - Bye , buddy . Feel better , New Christine . Oh , I do n't have ... Thank you . I 'm going to go change into my play clothes , too . Godspeed . You took him to church ? You took our son to church ? ! Look , he wanted to go . We were going anyway . It did n't seem like such a big deal . What ? You were going anyway ? What , you go to church now ? Why ? Just because your cute , young girlfriend does ? Hey . And thanks . You should 've asked me . Unbelievable . Richard , you and I talked about it , and we made the decision that Ritchie was going to have his spiritual education at home and not in a church . Watching Seventh Heaven is not a spiritual education . It is if you burn incense . Christine , it 's not a big deal . You went behind my back . That 's a very big deal . Man ... your poor parenting decisions never cease to amaze me . First , you want to take him to a Rolling Stones concert , and now you 're taking him to church ? ! There is n't a court in this land that would n't give me full custody of that boy right now . What exactly is your problem with church ? Yeah . People who go to church only like other people who go to church . Plus , they hate gay people . And I hate anyone who hates . You know what ? She 's right . It 's something we should n't have done without checking with her first . I 'm sorry , Christine . We made a mistake . Oh , well , thank you . I accept your apology . I 'm sorry , too . Geez . Thank you . I 'm sorry I snapped . It 's an emotional issue . I have low blood sugar . Just be thankful I did n't cry . All right , hope you feel better . Oh , I do n't have ... Thank you . God bless ... Gesund ... Good luck to you then . Ritchie , get up . What are you doing ? I 'm playing Battlefront Two . I just blew up a village . Good , okay . Put that away , sweetie , it 's time for bed . - Hey , Mom ? - Yeah . - What are we ? - What do you mean ? Well , my friend Riley is Catholic and he says Catholics pray to fathers and ghosts . Yeah , they do . Good night , sweetie pie . No , really . Are we something ? Um , well , yeah , of course , we 're something . We 're , um ... we 're Americans and we 're ... Californians . We bleed Dodger blue . But you know what , Ritchie ? Religion is n't really about labels . It 's about what you believe in . What do we believe in ? Uh , we believe in , uh , n-nature , the earth ... recycling and , uh , we believe in dolphins and , um , and diamonds . What about God ? Oh , yeah , and we believe in God . Yeah , okay . Good night , darling . I want to go back to church . How would you like to go to the zoo ? I want to go back to church . How would you like to go to Church 's Fried Chicken ? I want to go back to church . - Night , sweetie . - Night . I do n't know why he wo n't let this go . I know . I dropped him off at school this morning and he kept asking me all these questions . Like , do I believe in God ? Is there a heaven ? Is Mommy going to hell ? Why would he think that I was going to hell ? Maybe because you used that handicapped parking permit to do your Christmas shopping last year . Hey , I had an undiagnosed sleep disorder . And a lot of shopping to do . Ooh , this looks promising . Why do n't you just take Ritchie to church ? He 'll probably go once and be off it . It 's just like the fajitas . Do you remember he kept seeing those commercials and all he wanted was fajitas ? It was fajitas , fajitas , fajitas . It 's so weird the way he gets obsessed with these things , you know ? Ugh , could they cut these onions any thicker ? Ugh , this is wrong . Anyway , I 'm not a bad person for not wanting to take Ritchie to church , you know . - I have my reasons . - Such as ? Well , for one thing , they 're mean to gay people . They do n't pay their taxes . Do you pay your taxes ? Hey , I 'm handicapped . Besides , I 'm plenty spiritual without church . - How ? - I meditate . - When ? - In the tub . Well , that 's not meditating , that 's mas ... Shut up . Yeah , and that 's another thing . Who 's the church to tell me that I ca n't meditate in the tub ? I 'm a divorced woman . It 's hard . Not as hard as eating during this conversation . Okay , look , here 's the thing . Wait , Mom and Dad took you to church ? No , they dropped me off on their way to Indian Bingo . Anyway , I was 12 years old and I was searching for meaning in my life , you know , after they canceled The Mary Tyler Moore Show . Yeah , that was a good show . I loved it . Monroe . No , that 's Too Close For Comfort . Oh , that 's another good show . I 'm telling a story here , okay ? Anyway , I was having a hard time . I was in junior high school , I did n't have many friends , and I was searching for somewhere where I could belong . And I thought that church was where it could be . So I went . And nobody talked to me , and I did n't know what was going on most of the time . But I kept going back . On the day of my confirmation , they forgot to call my name . All the other kids got called up to the front , one by one , and I sat there in my little white gown with my beautiful flowers waiting to be called . You know , and at first I thought , okay , they 're going in order of height . And then I thought , oh , you know what ? They 're probably going to give me a special award and they 're saving me to the last . But no , they never called my name . They never called me to the front . So , hmm , I got my sign . I do n't belong in church . Wow . What did you do to God ? What ? No . That 's not right . It was them . It was n't me . God ... I know , honey , but you know , that was 50 years ago , and you 're okay now . I going to have to take him to church , are n't I ? Why am I such a good mother ? Okay , Ritchie , you know what ? If you do n't want to do this , we can turn around right now and we can go to the zoo . It 'll be fun . But you said we could go to church . Oh , God , I feel like I 'm 12 again . I do n't know how to act or what to do or where to look . Hey , hey , you 're going to be fine . I 'm sure it 's all going to come back to you . Okay . Come on , let 's go . All right , I 'll see you inside . Good morning , welcome . Hello , father , or , uh , your holiness . Sir ... oh . That 's really not necessary . Oh , yes , right , of course , yes . Married to God . Or is it Jesus ? Actually , it 's Joyce . Well , you 're a lucky man . I mean , she 's no Jesus , but ... So far , so good . So , this is your first time in church in a while . Yes , since my near confirmation . What 's a " near confirmation " ? La-la-la . Well , I , um , I went to church for a while . I wanted to find something there . I was looking for a sign , and then I finally got it . What was the sign ? La-la-la . Uh , it does n't matter . Who knows ? Maybe today you 'll find a different sign . We 'll see . That means no . I know it 's sometimes difficult to be in a strange place with new people , but I think you 'll find we 're a very welcoming community . Oh , uh , no , no , he 's going to stay with me . I know that God sees everything and stuff but he 's got enough on his plate , what with the Middle East and-and-and Project Runway , - and , uh ... - La-la . The kids really have a much better time at Sunday school than at the service . They 've got puppets . That sounds fun . Really , Ritchie ? Are n't puppets scary , with those dead eyes and the real seeming hair and everything ? Is it in there ? Yes , sir . See you after , Mom . Oh , uh ... Matthew , you go with him , okay ? And if anybody hurts his feelings , you get him out of there . - What if someone hurts my feelings ? - Matthew , go . Are you ready ? Uh , yeah , I-I do n't know , I 'm not sure . Oh , well , we have a great many gay people in our congregation . Oh , like that guy ? We do n't ask . Trust me . Shall we ? And although there were no actual mountains in that area of Galilee , it was nonetheless called the Sermon on the ... Anyone remember ? The Sermon on the Mmm ... oww -- Mouth . No . Not the Sermon on the Mouth , Benji . The Sermon on the Mount . But that was very good . Uh ... And the Sermon on the Mount is talked about in the Book of ... Maa ... Math -- Mouth . Not mouth . It 's never going to be mouth . - Matthew . - What ? The Book of Matthew . And is n't that interesting , Pippo ? Yes , it is , Mrs . Orr . Are you having fun , Pippo ? A little . Is that a real monkey ? We 've really got to get you to the zoo . Uh , well , in the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus was talking to his disciples about the Golden Rule . You know , " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . " Yes . Did you hear that , Pippo ? I sure did , Mrs . Orr . I-I-I was Jesus ' understudy in Godspell . The guy never got sick . Learned all the lines , never got to go on . What 's Godspell ? And now we will read from the scripture . All rise . " How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity . By all the earth-born race His honors be expressed ; but saints that know His heavenly grace should learn to praise Him best . " " Praise Him best .

You 're on a wire ? It 's not a wire . It 's a Holter monitor for my heart . I 'd really appreciate it if you did n't say anything to anyone about this . Viv , You okay ? What 's wrong ?

Presented in a-fib but she 's alert and oriented times four . It 's 1:05 A.M . and we 're approximately eight minutes out . Over - Got it , 782 . - How bad 's her condition ? I 'm not sure . The doctor will know more . When was she diagnosed ? Uh , when were you diagnosed ? A month ago . - What ? - A month . A month , a month , a month . Thanks . Lucebella had a great day today . Over $350 . Apparently crystals are back . Agnes , honey , are you okay ? I guess that means yes . Well , then , I can head home and you can stay here and be brave and in command . Good night . Hey . Hey . So what are we looking at ? Agnes Deschamps . She 's , um , 25 years old . This is her store . She sells new age products up front and she does psychic readings back here . She lives upstairs . No one 's seen her for a couple days . So who called it in ? Another psychic that works with her . She 's on her way here now . She could have saved herself some time and just told us where to look . How 's Viv ? Well , she 's checked out of the hospital , but , um ... she 's still going to have to have that surgery . Hmm . Hey , Jack ... check this out . Somebody did n't like their reading . Yeah . 3x19 : SECOND SIGHT Each of the dates is an appointment , when the client came in for a reading , and their symbols relate to what they talked about . Okay , but there 's no master list ? I mean , except for these phone numbers , there 's no way to figure out who any of her clients are ? No . I 'm sorry . Do you , uh , do you think she was scamming people ? I never felt any psychic energy from Agnes , but she was good with her clients . I mean , she had an-an instinct for discerning what they needed . Now , she may not have had the gift , but she was trying to help them . There 's this man , and he 's angry with me , you know , about what I did . Have you talked to him about it ? No , I-I sort of wanted to figure out how to handle it before I talked to him again . Okay . Think about ... why he 's angry . Now imagine yourself on a road ... moving away from the anger . Where 's the road going ? I do n't know . I 'm afraid I do n't know either . There 's a ... there 's a dark cloud around you , and I ca n't see through it . I 'm sorry . It 's not your fault . I just , um ... I 'm wasting your time . Let 's try a candle . See if it gives us any guidance . What have you got to lose . What exactly was she supposed to do with it ? Carve his initials at the bottom and then meditate on the situation while she was lighting it , and when it had burnt out , to bring it back and I 'd read it for her . Okay , and she never told you his name or anything about him ? No , but , um ... this morning I had a vision . A vision ? A van and the energy was ... frantic . I could feel Agnes ' presence . She was scared Um , does your vision come with an I.D . , a location ... ? You know , is it past , present , future ... ? I do n't know , but I think it had to do with that man . Okay . I 'm not making this up , Agent Spade . But I think ... We 'll be in touch . Thank you . Agnes ? Yes , sir . She 's been missing for two days . You ever see anyone hanging around , anything strange ? Think about it . I mean , it could be something small . About three weeks ago , I was at the dentist in the afternoon my-my gums were sore so , I was just in the house reading the paper and , uh , I heard thumping . Agnes ? Honey , you okay ? I 'm going to get help . No , no , Mr . Klumke . 9-1-1 . Uh , yes , we need an ambulance at 496 Hester Street in Queens . No , no no ambulance , no doctor . I 'm fine . You 're not fine , and you pay your taxes for moments just like this . Yes . My neighbor fell . They took her to St . Andrew 's . Kept her overnight . She brought me chocolates the next day . Made some joke about how clumsy she was . But now you 're not so sure she tripped ? You say she 's missing . Yeah . Thank you , sir . And you saw her once a week ? Agnes really helped me reach out to Glen . Reach out ... ? I missed him so much . Agnes helped me talk to him . Okay , according to her files , you were the last client she saw . Something happen between the two of you ? Nothing between us . We were talking about Glen , like always , and ... a man came in and ruined it . And he 's ready , Edgar . Ready for you to let go . But I do n't want to . I know . But it 's been nine months and Glen wants you to move on , to start doing the things you love to do . Remember how much you love to paint ? But what will I do without him ? When were you going to tell me ? I am with a client right now . I ca n't talk about this . Everything was in place and you screwed it up . Agnes ? It 's okay . Well , you should 've thought about that before ! Come back later , please . Now is not a good time . Agnes said the man 's arrival was a sign of how the spirits were upset because I would n't let go . Uh , do you have any idea who this man that interrupted you was ? I do n't know . Since that time , I have n't been able to feel Glen 's ... presence , and ... you have to find Agnes . I did n't get to say goodbye to him . Hello ? Hey , there . How you doing ? Well , I never thought I 'd miss going through credit card reports so much . Well , then I could sure use you here , because I 'm striking out on this one . No social , no bank accounts , no records anywhere . They 're out there somewhere . They 're always out there somewhere . Right . Luke 's . No , no . The doctor I saw at the hospital agrees with Dr . Marsh , so , uh , I guess I 'm through with the diagnostic phase . Okay , okay . Well , uh , I just thought I 'd give you a call . Is there anything else you need ? No , but thank you , sweetie . All right , well , take care , Viv . Okay , thanks . Bye . Bye . How is she ? Uh , she sounded all right . But you know how she is . Right . We found this in a dumpster behind Lucebella . What 's all that hocus-pocus ? I 'm not really sure . She used it in some kind of ritual . She was having problems with some guy . There 's some initials carved in the bottom . It 's kind of either a ' P ' or a ' B ' , but there 's definitely an ' L.C . ' Here . Hmm . Well , Samantha 's interviewing anyone we can track down . I 'll see if I can conjure up something on L.C . Oh , hilarious . Agnes Deschamps . Here we go . She came to the ER with a hairline fracture of her radius , concussion ... she stayed overnight . Did you see this guy with her ? Nope . It was almost a month ago . I 've seen a lot of patients since then . Were her injuries consistent with someone that took a fall ? Yeah , sure . Ah . Now I remember . Okay , the injuries she sustained that night were n't the only ones she had . Ms . Deschamps ... your arm , your leg ; there are other healed bone breaks on the film . I 'm just clumsy . Is somebody doing this to you ? Nobody 's doing anything to me . I can call the police . They can help you with this . Dr . Is your arm okay ? Let me take a look at this . Yeah , it 's fine . People 's bones do n't just fracture for no reason . So if it 's not someone doing this to you , then I 'll need to run more tests , figure out why this is happening . Have n't you already done a bunch of tests ? That was just for the fall . Not tonight . Ms . Deschamps , I insist . I really think ... Dr . Lee , please . Not tonight . Yeah , there 's definitely a tremor , so I set up an appointment with a neurologist . She did n't show . But he called me , said he checked her CT scan . Said there was enlarged caudate nuclei . And for the medically impaired ? We ca n't be certain , but given her other symptoms , I think it 's Huntington 's . What 's Huntington 's ? It 's a hereditary wasting disease . It destroys your ability to think and move . If she had a terminal illness , we have to consider suicide . Suicidal thoughts create a really strong energy . I could n't have missed that . Okay . Did Agnes even know she was sick ? You said she did n't go to that doctor 's appointment . Huntington 's is hereditary . If she knew someone who had it , had seen the symptoms , she might have figured it out for herself . Her grandmother . There you go . Doctor said it would only hurt for a couple days . Shows you what he knows . You know ... after I fell , I had this ... it was like a dream , but I was n't asleep . What did you see ? A bird ... on what looked like a wagon wheel . What color was the bird ? White . Somehow I knew it was my grandmother . You never talk about your family . I loved my grandmother . Thank you for the , uh , ice . Yeah . Sure . Her grandmother must have had it . Agnes told me but I just did n't know that 's what she was really saying . What does a white bird mean ? It means sorrow . I guess she had a lot to be sorrowful about . You know , we found that candle in a dumpster . It had initials carved into the bottom of it . Um ... L.C . Do you have any idea who that is ? She 's a client , but it 's not a man ... and I do n't think Mrs . Countryman would want to hurt her . She was doing some sort of candle ritual for me ? Yes , Mrs . Countryman . Do you have any idea why ? Well , she might have felt guilty about some mistakes she made in my recent readings , but I ... What do you mean , mistakes ? We were having some financial discussions . I just thought we should get together . Nothing bad , I hope ? No , no , no , not at all . Well , let ' em rip . You 're entering a new phase . And , uh , you should be open to ... uh , I think I was wrong . About what ? About your estate and , um ... that man . My nephew ? Yeah , you see , I thought the cards were saying that you should put him in charge , but they 're not . See , the knight still has to prove himself to the lady . But I 'm supposed to sign all the papers on Tuesday . Do n't sign anything , Luanne . Not now . I 've made a terrible mistake . I do n't know how it happened , but , um ... I 'm sorry . She felt so bad . She offered to refund the cost of all my sessions . Is that your nephew ? Yes , it is . Was there something between Agnes and Greg ? Greg , someone saw you threaten Agnes two days before she went missing , okay ? They do n't know what they 're talking about . That 's a nice car . When do you take delivery ? I know you put a deposit on it . Unfortunately , it was two weeks before Agnes told your aunt not to give you power of attorney . Expensive car , eyewitness , missing psychic ... It was Agnes ' idea , not mine . She came to me three weeks ago and she said she could get Luanne to put me in charge of everything . But then Agnes just changed her mind . Here 's your $10,000 back . I ca n't go through with it . But we are so close . She was all set to sign the papers . Your aunt is a good woman , Greg . Just be nice to her and she 'll probably make you trustee of the estate anyway . Please , Agnes , take this . And I will get you the rest , the whole fifty , all up front . Please . I 'm sorry , Greg . I 'm not going to change my mind . So I took my money and I left . What did Agnes need $50,000 for , Greg ? I do n't know . You 're going to have to tell your aunt the truth . She 'll never trust me again . That 's probably good . Technically , you 're not trustworthy . I just do n't think we need to do this now , that 's all . Well , how long should we wait ? Until I have another attack or right before surgery ? Okay , there 's no time like the present . Look , I just think we need to discuss a few things , that 's all . Or Rosemary and Richard . We could ask them . Richard is a Mets fan . Maybe we could get Rosemary to leave him . I just ca n't believe this is happening . What are you doing ? Hey . That scorched head came from a doll that was only distributed in three states Kentucky , Virginia and West Virginia . Well , that 's great , but I mean , what are you doing at Vivian 's desk ? My computer froze . Tech ca n't get to it until tomorrow . Oh . Did I ... did I do something wrong ? Well , you have n't said two words about it since she collapsed , at least not to me . And now I walk in and you 're sitting at Vivian 's desk , using her computer . You think I 'm being disrespectful to her ? No , I think you 're selfish and inconsiderate , is what I think . I 'm sorry . I , uh ..... I just Uh , will you guys come with me ? I need you to check something out . - Sure . - In the tech room . The Pittsburgh Field Office sent us this . It 's footage of an abduction at an Every-Mart last night . - All right , you see that van ? - Mm-hmm . Keep your eyes on it . All right ... Back it up to where they grab her . Stop , right there . That 's Agnes . We do n't have any footage of her inside the store , so we do n't know if she was being followed . But the plates on the van are from West Virginia . 2H7 , is that all we got ? Yeah , and the only light we had is coming from inside the van . I 've got West Virginia DMV running that sequence against all registered vans in the state . The police report had an eyewitness named Hilda Cahill . She 's the one who alerted security . I was thinking , what if she pulled a scam and that 's what the 50 grand 's about . She had to pay some people back . So this is what , them catching up to her ? Well , they 're a long way from New York and this was almost thirty hours after she went missing . Maybe they had her the whole time and this is her attempt at an escape . Who is that man ? I do n't know . You do n't know ? You told me about a van . Here it is . So either you 're involved , or you 're a psychic , and that part I find very difficult to believe . I do n't know who this man is . Then how did you know about the van ? I just ... I just do . Oh ! Look ... you 're dealing with some very difficult things right now . A sick friend . And it 's causing you to think about a problem you 're having with M . I 'd be happy to help , but I already told those other police everything that I saw . Oh , no . We 're sure you did . We 're just trying to confirm a few things , that 's all . Okay . Well , for that poor girl , anything I can do . Why do n't you start by telling us what happened that evening Now , according to this police report , you were , uh , shopping at the Every-Mart . They were having a sale on towels two for one and I was walking in the parking lot back to my car , but I could n't find it . And it 's not because of my vision I have 20-20 it 's that , I 'm sure that in that part of the parking lot all the lights were out . It was so dark . It made me nervous . And then I heard her scream . And she was gone before I knew what had happened . It was just , you know , so dark . You know , if you ask me , you know , I think that this is Every-Mart 's fault . Why do you think that ? Because if they had fixed those lights , this would n't have happened . All right . Now , the woman who was grabbed in the parking lot , is there any possibility that you saw her in the store before ? No . I-I do n't remember her . But now that you mention it She had a shopping bag . So , the shopping bag , did you see it on the ground ? I mean , it was dark , and we did n't see it on any of the security tapes . Oh . Right . Oh , I ... I 'm sorry , it 's just all this talking . I must be , you know , confused . Oh , well , we do n't want you to be confused . Right . I tell you what , um ... I 'll get you a cup of coffee , all right ? Ah , thank you . Hey . Hey , sorry , bro . My computer 's still down . Ah , mi computer , tu computer . Ah , bueno . How 'd it go with the eyewitness ? Uh ... she 's a moving target . What have you found ? Well , there 's not a single van in West Virginia with a 2H7 sequence on its plate . Stolen plates ? No , I do n't think so . I cross-referenced every plate with that sequence with all the residences that have a van . I found one match , a house in Greenville . There 's at least a hundred registered to this address . Mm-hmm . What 's the story ? Well , I 'm not sure yet , but I got a data-dump on all the people that own the cars . Mm-hmm . All right , one of them is on the major crimes watch list . Who 's that ? Mark Conway . Yeah , I got him right here . What 'd you do , Mark Conway ? Well , other than , uh , extortion and embezzlement , he 's suspected of being part of a clan of travelers a gypsy family group . You know , maybe all the people at that house are part of the clan . - The eyewitness . Hilda Cahill . - Right . The whole time that Jack and I were talking to her , it was as if she was trying to guess what we wanted her to say . She have a car on that list ? Nope . Well , check out Carla Callahan . Aka Heather Callahan , aka Heather Cahill . Aka Hilda Cahill . She 's one of them . Mm-hmm . Hilda , I 'm sorry , Heather . Wait , Carla . Okay , I 'm confused Uh ... You know what else you do n't know ? Who you 're talking to . I 'm FBI . If I want to , I can make your life a living hell . Do you understand that ? Do you understand that , Hilda ? Tell me what I want to know . His name is Patrick Orton , or Patrick O'Connell , or Patrick something else . The list goes on and on . You know , ' P ' is one of the initials on that candle . Mm-hmm . And he 's got a 2002 Dodge Ram , registered to the house in Greenville . That 's where the , uh , 2H7 license plate on the van came from . The cops checked out the house , but nobody was there . Now , this group or clan , they , uh , move east and west along I-64 , running scams in towns along the way . Do we know how Agnes got involved ? Well , Danny 's interviewing Ms . Cahill right now . Hopefully , she can tell us . You 're smart . You 're trying to figure out all the angles , but sometimes smart people complicate things . This is simple . All I want to know is what Agnes is doing with you guys that 's it . You tell me that , and you 're done . That 's it ? That 's it . She 's my niece . Her real name is Margaret . What else ? What else ? She stole $50,000 of the family 's money when she ran away from home seven years ago . Okay , I 'm going to need you to write down the names and the aliases of all the people involved in that fake kidnapping . You told me we were done . I lied . Oh , and here 's the part where I have to tell you that you 're entitled to that one phone call . Excuse me . All right , give her a phone , capture the number , but do n't let the call go through , okay ? Jack , look what I got . Hilda dialed a cell phone , and it pings off a tower 150 miles west of their home base in Greenville . Whose phone ? No idea . It 's registered to an alias , and the bills , they go to a post office box , so ... Are we tracking it ? Yep , it 's going towards Greenville . Well , maybe we can catch them along the way . This clan makes a living off selling defective RVs . What do you say we buy one ? Set up a sting . Great . Think our mark just showed up . You ready ? Yeah , I 'm ready . Howdy . I 'm Jack , I called you . Patrick Conway . Nice to meet you , Jack . Nice to meet you , Patrick . That 's a , uh ... that 's a nice-looking RV . And now that we got a grandson , the wife did n't want to go anywhere . Well , you know what , Patrick ? I think I can help her out with that . FBI . Freeze ! Put your hands up , put ' em on the hood of the RV . Up against the car . Come on . Spread your legs . That looks like a lot of people I know . Look , I do n't care about your Every-Mart scam , okay ? I just got to find Agnes , or Margaret or whatever you call her . Why ? Because she stole $50,000 from you , and I do n't know what you would have done to get it back . You think I hurt her ? She broke from the clan . She 's still my daughter . She 's your daughter ? She ran away with some ... kid from outside , seven years ago . That 's why she had to make it right . It 's a little over $7,000 . But if I showed up with fifty , would you be any less mad ? Probably not . I was 17 . And Lester , he ... he told me a lot of stories about what life would be like in New York . What was it like ? For Lester , I bet it was great . He skipped with all the money about a week after we ran away . I wanted to call you , but I could n't . I knew how mad you 'd be . I kept thinking about how much I let you down . I 've missed you so much . I thought about you all the time . I even ate a piece of red velvet cake on your birthday every year . Since your grandmother died , nobody makes it anymore . That 's all the money I 've saved . But I want to come home , Daddy . Please ? Daddy , I just , I need to come home . If it were up to me ... but there 's the clan . I think flowers would have been a nicer homecoming . You 're not one of us . You would n't understand . She has Huntington 's . You know that , right ? Listen to me . Like I told you , I do n't care about your scam here . As far as I 'm concerned , I do n't know anything . I just want to see your daughter , to make sure she 's okay . I 'll bring her to you . You know , I have a feeling she 's nearby . Why do n't you just , um , why do n't you just call , have her brought here ? Come on , baby . This is , uh , Jack Malone . He 's with the FBI . We got to talk to him , okay ? Hi , how you doing ? Patrick , why do n't you come over here with me . Come on . Let 's take a little walk . You okay ? I 'm fine . I 'll make good on it . Your father knows you 're sick . You told him ? Mm-hmm . You need to see a doctor . Have you ever seen anyone die of Huntington 's ? No . Their arms and legs , they jerk around like they 're trapped and trying to get away . No talking . No laughing . And it takes a really long time . When I fell down the stairs , I knew it . I could n't do this on my own . My family will stay with me . Who else would do that ? No one . You take care . It 's gon na be okay , baby . It 's going to be all right . It 's okay . Let 's go . Hi . Agent Spade . I just wanted to make sure that you heard about Agnes . Yeah . A gypsy . Huh . Who knew ? You could have just called me . Yeah . The thing is , I was , um ..... I should probably go . Would you like a reading ? Yeah . Yeah , I would . Okay . How 's Reggie ? He 's a pain in the ass . Why is that ? I think he 's , you know , a bit sick of myself and Marcus being around the whole time . Yeah , like most teenagers are like that . Look , I 'm sorry I left you shorthanded . Hey , it 's not a problem . We got it covered . Really ? Mm-hmm . You look like you could use some sleep . Well , nobody minds putting in a few extra hours till you get back on your feet . I collapsed , so we did n't have a chance to talk about what 's going on with this . No . I understand if you need to fill the chair . It 's not necessary . I 'm just saying it 's okay . I know .

Someone came at me with a nasty-looking knife . Did n't really know why until now . - Faith , we did n't ... - Forget it . lt 's cool . I get by . What are we gon na do about her ? I guess we should find Buffy , tell her what 's going on . I tried calling home . Dawn says she 's out patrolling . Let 's look for her . Cemetery 's more fun anyway . Somebody should wait here in case she wakes up . - Fine . Sit tight . I 'll be back . - Wait . Maybe you meeting Buffy alone is n't the best idea . You told her the sitch , right ? She knows I 'm coming . Probably been up all night hangin ' streamers . Yeah , but it 's not like you 're study buddies , exactly . I ca n't stay here , Willow . Spent way too much time in hospitals . We do n't click . Do n't worry . I 'm sure we 'll get along just fine .  What you want to do to her , vamp ? Something like this ? Nice punch you got there . Let me guess . Leather pants , nice right cross , doe eyes , holier-than-thou glower . You must be Faith . - Oh , goody . I 'm famous . - Told you were coming . - Bit of a misunderstanding here . I 'm ... - Spike . We 've met before . We have ? I do n't think we ... Bloody hell . What are you doing ? I 'm on your side . Yeah ? Maybe you have n't heard . I 've reformed . So have I . I reformed way before you did . Stop ... hitting ... me ! We 're on the same side . - Please ! You think I 'm stupid ? - Well , yeah . It 's all right , B . Luckily you still punch like you used to . - You OK ? - Yeah . Terrific . You 're protecting vampires ? Are you the bad slayer now ? Am I the good slayer now ? He 's with me . He has a soul . - He 's like Angel ? - No . - Sort of . - I 'm nothing like Angel . He fights on my side . Which is more than I can say for some of us . If he 's so good , what 's he doing chasing down defenceless ... - That 's one of the bad guys . - You should make ' em wear signs . May I ? Thanks . Angel 's dull as a table lamp , and we have different colouring . OK , catching up . Anything else I got ta know ? Nice to have you back . Whoa . Memory lane . Same old house . Hey . Got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive ? Hello , Faith . - I guess " wanted " was n't really accurate . -  Does she have to stay here ? There 's hotels for  types . Check it out . Brat 's all woman-sized . I need to get to the hospital . A girl was attacked on her way into town . - She might ... - We know . Willow 's been calling . She 's still there . She 's gon na call if the girl wakes up . Fine . Well , Faith , we 'd better ... see if we can find someplace to squeeze you in for the night . Not all that tension was about you . Giles was part of a plan to kill me ... for Buffy 's own good . Well , that makes me feel better about me , worse about Giles , kinda shaky about you . Drink of this , for it is my blood . I recall , as a boy , though , I could n't help but think " What would happen if you were at the Last Supper , and you ordered the white ? " A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin . Would he make that out of his lymph or somehow ? Never did bring it up . Suppose there was a reason why I never spent too long in one parish . Just lookin ' for answers . Just lookin ' for the Lord in the wrong damn places . Then you showed me the light . Do you think I 'm God ? I certainly do not . I am beyond concepts like that . But you still wear the outfit . Man ca n't turn his back on what he come from . Besides , black is slimming ' . Everyone knows that . How do you like what I 'm wearing ? Just another dirty girl . And ... the loneliness that comes with real strength . Nothing about my pert and bouncy hairdo ? - You 're her . - The Slayer . At long last . All this time . All the work I 've done for you . Blowin ' up the Council , organising ' the Ray Charles brigade , and ... stickin ' all them splits . - You never showed me . - Well , you 've earned it . And you 'll be meeting her soon . Am I right ? Oh , yeah . She 'll get the message . - And what makes you so sure she 'll come ? - Curiosity . Woman 's first sin . I offer her an apple . What can she do but take it ? I 'll see you soon .  Faith . Her name alone invokes awe . Faith . A set of principles or beliefs upon which you are willing to devote your life . The dark slayer . A lethal combination of beauty , power , and death . But like so many tragic heroes , Faith was seduced by the lure of the dark side . She wrapped evil around her like a large , evil Mexican serape . She became a cold-blooded killer . Nobody was immune to her trail of destruction . Not friends , not family , not even the most pacifist and logical of races . What the hell are you talking about ? I thought Faith killed a volcanologist .  Silly , silly ... Amanda . Why would Faith kill a person who studies Vulcans ? He studied volcanoes . He was a professor . Ah ... yes . Well , regardless ... I thought you were n't supposed to be doing this any more , making up stories . I 'm not . This is true . Except for that ... possible ... word misunderstanding . There are things you need to know about . Faith ... has a history not to be taken lightly . She 's a killer . Never forget that .  - You look better . - No , I don't . - No , you don't . - I 'll be OK . Unless , of course , you start beating up on me now . I wo n't . Well , I thought about it . I made some doodles . As far as I 'm concerned , we 're on even ground . I meant what I said . I do n't have time for your vendetta . But I need you in this fight . I want you on my side . Thanks . That means a lot . - So we 're good ? - Absolutely . - You 're fired . - What ? Effective immediately . You 're firing me ? I just refrained from kicking your ass . Buffy , there 's nothing here for you . People are leaving town , half the kids do n't even show up any more . You 've got much worse things to deal with . - Look at the big picture . - Right . Not dead . Not dead , not if you get them ready . I do n't wan na lead them into war . It ca n't be the right thing . Most wars are n't , you know . Some of these girls have n't even been tested in battle . Then , I guess , maybe you should test them . Could n't I come to work part-time ? I could make fliers for encounter groups . And you 're fired again . Remember , Buffy , the mission 's what matters .  You craving a moment alone in the dank , or can I bum one ? Well , I guess you can smoke all you want . The big C not really an issue . Teeth get yellow ... after an eternity . - Got ta watch that . - Huh . - Right . lt 's not what it looks like . - Hey , to each his own , man . - This before the soul or after ? - After , but I got over it . In case you 're feeling all dust-happy after your incarceration . Not if you 're all repenty . Takes the fun out of it .  No more Starbucks for the wannabes , man . They 've been spazzing for hours . - Yeah . Does get a bit much up there . - They 're good girls . Just green is all . - So why are n't you up there ... imparting ? - That 's Buffy 's thing . Anyway , I just spent a good stretch locked away with a mess of females . - Kinda had my fill . - Hm . But you waited until Angel needed your help to bust out . Three squares , nice weight room , movie every third Sunday . Could 've been worse . - What movie ? - Last one was Glitter . I guess it could n't have been worse . You had the power to walk away any time . You over it ? More or less . I pull for the good guys now . - What 's the less ? - The usual stuff . Such as ? I was thinking about looking up the guy with the bullwhip . Long incarceration . You could do better . Schoolgirl thing 's old hat . It 's all old hat , man . Every guy 's got some whack fantasy . Scratch the surface of any granola-type dude - naughty nurses and horny cheerleaders . - I figure , if you ca n't beat ' em ... - Join ' em . - Just do n't forget who 's on top . - That , I suspect , would be you . You got that right . I 've met you before , you know . Yeah , you made a great impression on my chin . Not in the graveyard . Before that . - I was kinda wearing a different body . - Pity . You seemed OK with it . The body swap ... with Buffy . Failed to mention who was driving her skin . I may have said a few things . You could ride me at a gallop till my knees buckled , squeeze me till I pop like warm champagne . It 's not the kind of thing a man forgets . Should 've known it was n't Blondie . She 'd never throw down like that . Oh , you have been away . Do n't tell me little Miss Tightly-Wound 's been getting her naughty on ? - Not of late . - Wow . Everybody 's just full of surprises . Hey , B . Well , it 's nice to see you two getting along so well . Yeah . You just know all the cool vampires . Yeah . - Are n't you usually at work about now ? - I decided to cut back on my hours . -  Buffy ? is that you ? - Down here . Figured I 'd better focus on what 's going on around here . Buffy , Willow just called from the hospital . At least , he dressed like one . I thought he was trying to save me ... at first . He picked you up on the side of the road ? Bringers were chasing me . He said they were his boys . Right before he burned me . He wanted to tell you something . Before he ... cut me ... he told me to give the Slayer a message . - What is it ? - He said ... " I have something of yours . " We 've got a new player in town . Dresses like a preacher . Calls himself Caleb . Looks like he 's working for the First . He 's taunting us , calling us out . Says he 's got something of mine . Could be another girl . Could be something else . Do n't know . Do n't care . I 'm tired of talking . I 'm tired of training . He 's got something of mine ? Fine . I 'm getting it back , and you guys are coming with me ... You , I was looking for you . That right ? I heard you speakin ' tonight . Preachin ' . I felt your words go straight to me . Well , the truth is like a sword , is n't it , girl ? Cuts deep . Yeah . The words I use got a power to ' em . Power , now . They 're notjust words . They 're truth . - They brought me here . - They called you . Know why ? Because you 're human . You got your urges . A woman 's got hers . A man 's got his . Our whole race can be so damnably weak . That 's why we seek the strength , the power . It 's not wrong to be drawn to the power , is it , preacher ? Oh , no , child . lt 's not wrong .  Just human . Most people do n't like visits from their dead , you know . Heathens . - One of those potentials you killed , perhaps ? - No . Save them for later . I 'm in more of an old memory lane kinda mood . Back before I met you , there was a choirgirl in Knoxville I gave singing lessons to . She even screamed on key . Show me her . All these girls . They followed you willingly . - You tricked them . - I only told them the truth . As for following , well ... that seems to be what they do best . We need to arm the girls . I wan na be ready when we find him . - We do n't know where we 're going . - We 're gon na do some recon . - You up for it ? - Point me where you want me . You 're certain about this ? You do n't know what this man has of yours , if anything . It could be a girl , a potential trying to get to us . Could be a stapler . It 's time we test them . I 'll take the ones that have been here longest . The rest can stay . Could be that 's what he wants . The old bait-and-switch . He lures us away and then kills the girls we leave behind . I know . That 's why I need you to stay here with them . You 're my most powerful weapon , Will . You can keep them safe if anything happens . An unknown man breezes into town , says he has something of yours . Buffy , this has " trap " written all over it . He wo n't be expecting a full attack . That 's why we have to move . We know nothing about this man . We can not go into battle unprepared . We need more time . Giles , we do n't have time . And you 're not going into battle . I need you to stay behind with the others . He got sonar or somethin ' ? Or something , I guess . Pretty good when they attack . They just roam free around town ? Normally they show up out of nowhere , and either stab or get stabbed , then run off . - Looks like this guy wants to be found . - Lends weight to the " it 's a trap " theory . I am through waiting for people to attack us . I 'm with you . Drop me in the hornet 's nest , what the hell ? You got a rough sitch here , trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army . They 're potential slayers , just like we were . - Right . Maybe they 'll do as good as us . - They 're getting better . I 'll work with them . Some of ' em seem real eager . Fashion disasters , yeah , but they 're ready to fight . - Why did you come back ? - Willow said you needed me .  I 'm ... glad that you 're here . lt 's good . - Thank you . - No problem . You know me . All about the good deeds . Willow said you helped out Angel . Yeah . He says " Hi . " - Really ? - Sure . - How is he ? - Better . I had to do this magical mind-walk with him . - You were in Angel 's mind ? - Buffy ... - What is this place ? - Look , there 's more of ' em . - I think we just found our hornet 's nest . - Let 's get the cavalry . Now remember , we 're looking for killing blows only , people . So , chest and throat if it 's a vampire . Stomach , chest and face if it 's a bringer . - What if it 's something else ? - Could happen . Something otherworldly . Go for the centre . Brain , heart , eyes . Everything 's got eyes . -  Except the Bringers . - Except the Bringers . I do n't want there to be tentacles . I 'm not good with squishy . I do n't care if it 's Godzilla . I wan na get in this thing . Godzilla 's mostly Tokyo-based , so he 's probably a no-show . Besides , if Matthew Broderick can kill Godzilla , how tough is he ? - Xander ! - Matthew Broderick did not kill Godzilla . He killed a big , dumb lizard that was not the real Godzilla . You people are even crazier than her . - Than who ? - Buffy , man . I mean , taking us right into the bad guy 's lair . That 's where , generally speaking , you 'd go to find the bad guy . - I do n't think you came here to fight plaque . - No , I came here for protection ... This plan is trouble . Buffy does n't care if she puts us in danger . Let me tell you something about Buffy . You should all listen to this . We kinda were . I 've been through more battles with Buffy than you all can ever imagine . She 's stopped everything that 's ever come up against her . She 's laid down her life , literally , to protect the people around her . This girl has died two times , and she 's still standing . You 're scared ? That 's smart . You got questions ? You should . But you doubt her motives , you think Buffy 's all about the kill ? Then take the bus to battle . I 've seen her heart , and this time not literally . I 'm telling you right now , she cares more about your lives than you will ever know . You got ta trust her . She 's earned it . Damn ! I never knew you were that cool . Saddle up . OK . Set up a perimeter , guard the door . I do n't want anything getting in behind us . My team goes in first , we check it out . You guys are our safety net . If it 's a trap , we give the signal , you guys come in , guns a-blazing . - What 's the signal ? - I 'm thinkin ' lots and lots of yelling . Got it . Shall we ? - What is this place ? - Looks like an old vineyard . - An evil vineyard , huh ? - Like Falcon Crest . Stay alert , you guys . The Bringers are here somewhere . - Just need to find out where . - Should n't be too hard . Well , now ! You girls are just burnin ' with righteousness , are n't you ? But you think you 're blazing like suns , when really you 're burning like matchsticks in the face of the darkness . Save the sermon , padre . I heard you have something of mine . Well , I do now . You liked my message , did you ? I ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl . Got her soiled blood all over the place . I may need to get a new truck . So you 're the Slayer . The Slayer . The strongest , the fastest , the most aflame with that most precious invention of all mankind - the notion of goodness . The Slayer must indeed be powerful . So , what else you got ?  Let 's go ! Kennedy ! Miss , you have your own problems you should be worried about .  Oh , good . There 's more of you . Buffy ! You 're the other one , are n't you ? Your Cain to her Abel . No offence meant to Cain , of course . - Never was much for the Good Book . - Oh , it has its moments . Good folk , bad folk . Clean folk , dirty folk . No ! Yes . Xander , get them outta here . We have to retreat . Do it . What can I say ? I work in mysterious ways . Also some fairly straightforward ones . We are leaving . Are you OK ? Let 's go . Come on . Let 's go ! Come on ! You 're the one who sees everything , are n't you ? Let 's see what we ca n't do about that . Argh ! Xander ! Come on .  Now , it 's a simple story . Stop me if you 've heard it . I have found and truly believe that there is nothing so bad it can not be made better with a story . And this one 's got a happy endin ' ... And why ? Because she did not know . She could not see . She did n't know the good news , the glory that was comin ' . That 'd be you . For the kingdom , the power , and the glory are yours , now and forever . You show up , they 'll get in line , cos they followed her . All they have to do is take one more step , and I 'll kill them all . See ? I told you it had a happy endin ' .

@@5231141 Ravens win ! Mommy , Ravens win . Haley . That 's weird , I thought Mommy would 've beat us home by now . Hey . Nathan , hi . I 'm so sorry . You got Jamie , right ? Yeah , yeah . What happened ? Where are you ? Oh , I got locked in the library with Lindsey and Peyton . I missed the whole game . I 'll fill you in on all the gory details as soon as I get home . I 'm on my way , okay ? All right , well , I 'm just about to put Jamie to bed , and then I 'm gon na take a quick shower . Oh , and Haley , I love you . - I love you , too . - Bye . Do I really have to go to bed , Daddy ? Yep . PJs , brush teeth , bed . Five minutes . - Come on , chop-chop . - Oh , I missed you , too . Whoa , Carrie ! Carrie , what are you doing ? This is not okay . You have to get out of here . It 's okay , Nathan . I love you , too . What are you talking about ? You think I love you ? Carrie , you have to get out of here . Here , take this . Go . Get out of the shower . Carrie , get out of this bathroom right now . Haley , this ... Oh , my God . This ... This is n't this , okay ? I swear to you , I did n't ... Look , I have n't ... Carrie , tell her . Nathan loves me and I love him back . I want you to get the hell out of my house . Right now ! Haley , look , I know this must look ... You get out , too . - Look , I did n't ... - Get out ! Touch ? . What are you doing here , John ? The big corporate label finally fire you ? I happened to catch this new artist 's live performance that just went completely viral online . Perhaps you know her ? Mia Catalano ? She 's my artist , John . It 's a pretty big office for such a small label , do n't you think ? Well , I 've got a good act . And that 's one more than you 've got at your great big label . It 's good to see you , Sawyer . By the way , what are you feeling about the first single ? Only Fooling Myself ? John , stay away from Mia . Let me ask you something , Peyton . If a great song is recorded , but nobody gets a chance to hear it , does it really exist ? Hey . Hey , Peyton , check it out . Haley made the finished version sound so much better than the demo . Mia , I need to ask you a question , okay ? Were you approached by a record executive named John Knight ? You mean that creepy old guy who said he used to be your boss ? - No wonder you left LA . - No , no , this is serious . What did he say ? Nothing . He said he saw my MySpace video and that he wanted to hear the whole record . Is that all he said ? Mia , come on . What else did he say ? He said I made a big mistake in signing with you , and you do n't have the experience to launch me . Hey , handsome . Peyton in her office ? She was . Just took off . Looked like she was on a mission . She was n't armed , was she ? I do n't think so , but I did n't get a chance to pat her down . Oh . Easy , tiger . You know something , I think I missed my calling . Really ? How 's that ? Should have gone into the clothing design business . If you can run a multi-million-dollar company from a barstool , while sipping a . m . Cocktails , how hard can it be ? Plenty hard . You have no idea . That your story ? Do n't write checks you ca n't cash , buddy . I 'd be happy to whisk you up to New York anytime and show you how impressive and complicated it all really is , bartender boy , but , if I did , who would tend to the bar ? Flights leave on the hour , so , I dare you . All right . You 're on , Brooke Davis . Okay . So you 've heard ? Haley kicked me out . I need a place to stay . What is that ? It 's Dan . He 's up for parole . Supposed to be a smiley face . How long ? I 'm not sure yet , sweetheart . Who 's gon na take me to school ? I am . In fact , I got everything ready . I made your lunch and I packed your backpack . Yummy . You cut my PB and J sideways . Carrie cuts it in half . I like it cut in half . Well , it tastes the same both ways , I promise . Katie Brown 's mom cuts her sandwiches sideways and she 's always trying to kiss me . Yuck . - Daddy ! - Hey . Jamie , can you go upstairs for a few minutes , sweetheart ? - Why ? - Hey , why do n't you go upstairs and fire up the PlayStation ? Mommy 's gon na let you play for 10 minutes before you go to school . - Sweet . - Sweet . He served good time and it 's been about five years , so , yeah . That 's not why I 'm here . All right , I 'm listening . There is absolutely nothing going on between me and Carrie . Did n't look like nothing . Haley , she 's got some kind of weird crush and she thinks the feeling 's mutual , but it 's not . There was some flirting and I let it go and I should n't have , but I swear to you , that 's all there was . - What else , Nathan ? - Nothing . I just ... I mean , I guess I knew that she was getting attached . I was gon na say something to you , okay ? I was , but ... I just need you to know that there is nothing going on between us . Damn it , Nathan . I really thought we were , like , rounding this corner of everything , you know ? I do n't ... Haley , please , just ... Can you just ... Can you just go to Dan 's hearing , and then we can find a time to deal with this later ? Please ? Okay . Nathan . There better not be more . I will be damned if I let you steal my artist , John . It 's not stealing if she wants it to happen . Did she say that ? What did you tell her ? A bunch of lies to make her feel that way ? Like you did with that little actress out in LA ? How 'd that go ? Oh , admittedly , that could have gone better . See , I heard you convinced her to quit her hit TV show in order to tour for this record . But I guess your ghostwriter and your cool producer did n't really work out , did they ? Because now , thanks to you , she does n't have a music career or a TV show . And I will not let that happen to Mia . She deserves way better than that . Are you finished ? That 's a nice speech , Peyton . The only question is , can you back it up ? Huh ? You got a lot of great albums on that wall . But the sad truth is , you would n't have heard of half of them without the support of a major label . I should know . I signed four of them . You know what ? Mia 's gon na make it . We 'll be just fine . Are you sure ? Just look at that wall again . All those artists have two things in common . Great songs and a major label . I 'll be honest , I 'd love to sign Mia . I wan na get her music out there into the world , because it is great . Here . I 'm in town until tomorrow morning . Do the right thing , Sawyer . Mitchell , sub in for Q . Man , why you pulling me , Coach ? Come on . Let me see your hand . All right , we 'll get a doctor to take a look at that . Grab some pine . Jamie . Jamie . Why are you sad , Nanny Carrie ? Well , I 'm sad because I have to go away . But I do n't want you to go away . Why do you have to leave ? I really do n't wan na leave you , it 's just ... Your mommy does n't like Nanny Carrie . She wants me to leave . But I want you to stay . So do I . But your mom 's the boss and what she says goes . I wish you were my little boy . I always will . Goodbye , Jamie . Okay , you have 4,000 square feet on Central Park West . - Mmm-hmm . And it doubles as a crash pad when I want to party in the East Village . Somebody 's here . - Rachel . - Brooke , get a shower running . Make it cold . I 'm gon na need some towels . Rachel . Rachel , can you hear me ? Brooke . Shower . Now . - Okay . - Come on . Come on , Rachel . Come on . Come on , baby . Come on . Come on , baby . Baby , come on . Wake up . Rachel , wake up . Come on , come on . Wake up . Open your eyes . Open your eyes , sweetie . Come on . Come on . Wake up ! Wake up , come on . Come on , wake up . - Please do n't let her die . - Come on , wake up ! Come on , baby . Baby , wake up . Rachel . Rachel , open your eyes ! Open your eyes ! Wake up ! Please , wake up ! But , no , she 's not okay . Do I need to take her to the emergency room ? Her color 's back , she 's breathing , she 's out of any immediate danger . Just let me keep an eye on her a little bit longer . We 'll see . Okay . How do you know her ? She 's a friend from home . I hired her to model for the company . Have n't seen her in a while . I knew she had problems , but not like this . She started screwing up photo shoots , and Victoria insisted I let her go . I need to help her . What do I do ? Start by getting rid of this . Do n't put it in the trash . Why ? When she wakes up , that 's the first place she 'll look . Okay . Well , I 'm afraid it 's not good . Man , I ca n't do that . I 'm gon na miss too many games , man , I 'm ... You know what , this is my last season , okay ? To impress the scouts if I wan na play college ball . All right ? Help me out , man . You need the cast on . You do n't have a choice . I 'm sorry . Hey , baby . How was your day at school ? What 's wrong , Jamie ? Why did Nanny Carrie have to go away ? Um ... Little man , you know , with grownups sometimes they just need to move on with their own lives . And Nanny Carrie decided that it was time to move on with her life . That 's not what she said . She said you sent her away ' cause you hated her . - She did n't wan na go . The man is a complete snake . I 've seen him do it a thousand times . He offers you the moon and throws you out there and the second you fall short he drops you just like that . Look , I do n't care about him . I love this record and I 'm sure we 'll be okay . No , we will . You 're right . We will be okay . We 'll be better than okay , and you know why ? Because I 've got a plan . We 're gon na roll out your first single on college radio , we 'll get you out there on tour , then we 'll do guerilla marketing , like flyers and wild postings in all the mass markets . Oh , and I 've got a lot of street-team contacts out in LA that I know would love to work with you . That sounds great . No . No , it does n't , Mia . No , Peyton , do n't feel that way . I do n't . But it 's true , honey , okay ? You made a much better record than I thought you could , and you deserve the spot on the big tour and the kind of airplay and big promotion that I just , I ca n't give it to you . No . It does n't matter . You 're the one who got me here and I wan na stay with you . - You really mean that ? - Absolutely . Okay . - I need to get my stuff . - It 's in the garage . Boxes are marked " whore . " I 'll have the keys now . I 'm sorry , Haley . I never meant for it to turn out this way . Did you go by Jamie 's school today ? Jamie looks at me as family . I was just saying goodbye . No . You are not family . I know you 're upset . Just know that I never meant for Nathan to fall in love with me . Oh , honey . He 's not in love with you , I can promise you that . Did he tell you he kissed me ? Hmm . He did n't tell you , did he ? God , that is so Nathan . Well , he did kiss me and he watched me swim naked and he liked it . You see , he wanted me in that shower . I 'm sorry that it 's hard for you to face , but it 's the truth . I have told you once and I am not gon na tell you again . Stay the hell away from my family ! I hate you ! Jamie . Well , well . Am I dead ? You OD'ed . You 're alive , but you 're really stupid . Rachel , what happened to you ? I do n't know . Life happened , I guess . You fired me . Who is it ? Brooke , lock the door . Do n't come out till I say . - Hey , man , come on in . - Who are you ? Oh , it 's cool , Rachel said you were gon na be stopping by . Come on in , man . Come on . We 're all in the waiting room here . So , where 's Rachel ? She 's ... She 's right here . Let me go , man . I did n't do nothing to you . Yeah , well , my friend is falling out on your junk back there . - So , where is it ? - I do n't know what you 're talking about . You ever come in here again , I will break your neck . - Do you hear me ? - Yeah . Yeah . That bitch owes me a lot of money , man ! Owen , who was that ? Nobody that 's coming back . So , how 'd it go with Haley ? She 's gon na need more time . Well , give it to her . You owe her that . I just wish he would 've helped us more , you know ? It would 've been really nice to have a father today . Someone I could actually turn to for advice . Yeah . You know , for the past four years , I 've pretended that Dan did n't exist . Then I get this letter and it hits me . That one day , we may have to face having him in our lives again . Let 's not let that be today . Hello , Son . Hello , Peyton . I was pretty sure I 'd be hearing from you . Well , I thought about what you said and I think you 're right about Mia . So the assistant to the assistant finally learns the business . Congratulations , Peyton . It 's about time . That 's not what you said earlier today . You said that he was an evil snake that could n't be trusted . So , which is it , Peyton ? In spite of what she said earlier , I think you should listen to her now , Mia . She 's making a lot of sense . Oh , really ? She 's making sense now ? Listen , you can do whatever deal you want with her . Just know that I will never play for you . Never . I 'm an artist , not a business transaction . You know , Peyton , I really thought we had something special . Thanks for selling me out . No , Mia . Mia , wait . Afternoon . When I was 17 years old , I fell in love . Her name was Karen and for a long time , she loved me back . We had a son , Lucas , but we never became the family we should have been . Instead , my brother Keith assumed that role . There 's no excuse for the crime that I committed . And believe me when I tell you I spend every moment wishing I could take that fateful day back . Keith Scott is dead because of me . And that 's something I have to live with for the rest of my life . So I 'll just make one pledge here today . If at some time you decide to grant me my freedom , know that I 'll spend every living moment trying to mend the lives of the people that I hurt by my actions . Because I 've lost more than my freedom . I 've lost something far more important than that . A family . These young men stand at the dawn of their adult lives . So far , because of what I 've put them through , they 've had it pretty rough . They deserve better . They deserve a father . I hope someday you 'll give them that . Thank you , Mr . Scott . Please , go ahead . My father abandoned my mother when she was pregnant with me . He left us to struggle on our own , even though he was a man of means . Growing up , I only had one person to look after me . Keith Scott . And this man killed him . His own brother , in cold blood at point-blank range . Next week , I 'm getting married . Keith would have been my best man . But he 's not gon na be there , just like he was n't there to see my state championship or see my first novel published . Dan took all that . He did it with malice and premeditation . Dan is an educated man and if he 's nothing , he 's very persuasive . Do not let him fool you . He has a very dark and ugly heart . And he should never be allowed to walk the streets a free man . So as you deliberate his fate , I ask you only one question . Thank you . Actually , it looks here that , Nathan , you 've been to visit your father recently . Is that true ? Yes . What the hell ? You went to go see Dan and you did n't tell me . Why ? ' Cause I was done with him and I wanted to tell him to his face . I did n't think it mattered . Well , it did matter . Just like getting up there and telling them who he really is mattered . - Do n't you get it ? - Get what ? If they think you still need Dan in your life , they might let him out . You know , it 's not me I 'm worried about . Or you . It 's Jamie . Dan 's gon na try to get to him . You know that . The only way to keep your family safe is if Dan stays locked up . You mean you had a problem ? No . I 'm saying I 'm an addict . A junkie , Brooke . You ever wonder why you never see me take a drink behind the bar ? Been sober eight years . How 'd you make it back ? Had a friend . He helped me . I 'd be dead right now if it was n't for him , no question . He never gave up on me . See , Brooke , I can understand the whole cutting off Rachel on the business side , but I 'm struggling with the whole friendship side . You do n't know my mother . Victoria is relentless when she wants something , and it 's easier to just do it than to fight her . You ever wonder where you 'd be if at some critical moment when you needed it the most , your friends just were n't there for you ? Can she ever be okay again ? I do n't know . Maybe . They 've got a facility here , it 's the best in the city . And I can take her there for you , if you need me to . I need to do it . I have to step up for her . She needs me . In that case , I 'm gon na go . Do not give up on her , Brooke . You are better than that . Some first date , huh ? Is that what this was ? You know , I have to say , your life is really impressive . The real estate , the business , the money ... It 's just not what really interests me . What 's under all the clothes , Brooke Davis ? Did n't expect to find you here . Oh , you know ... Ai n't nothing like an empty gym when you wan na be alone with your thoughts , man . - What you doing here ? - The same . Boy , that ... That must have been something special . Truth be told , I took it for granted a little bit . I mean , breaking all those records and the scouts coming to see me play , the state championship ... I wish I could go back . I 'd appreciate it more . I just want it so bad , man . You know ? - Is that okay to say ? ' Cause I ... - Sure . And you 'll get there . And when you do , just be sure to enjoy it . ' Cause it only comes once . In the blink of an eye , it can all be gone . You got ta trust me , Rachel . This is the best rehab facility in the city and I 'm gon na take care of everything . I do n't care what it costs . Please , Brooke . Please , I do n't wan na be alone again , all right ? I do n't wan na go to some strange place . Honey , we both know that 's not realistic . You have a problem and you need to go . Brooke , you 're my only friend . If you leave me this time , I wo n't make it . Please do n't give up on me . Ca n't I just stay here with you ? - Hey . - Hey . Look , man , I 'm sorry about what happened today with Dan . I let you down . I could have done better , I just ... He got to me . You know ? And I know you 're always looking out for Jamie , just ... You got ta understand , I would never let anything happen to him . Then go be his dad . Work things out with your wife . It 's really bad , man . Just talk to her , okay ? And remember it might be better to save your marriage than to be right on this one . Wow . Thanks , man , I know that was supposed to be Keith . I 'm honored . Miss you . Hey , Jim Jam . Time for bed , buddy . Here we go . Want me to read you a story ? How about Go , Dog . Go ! You like that one , right ? Where 's Daddy ? Mommy and Daddy are just having a little bit of a tough time right now . He 's staying with Uncle Lucas . Is Daddy gon na be sad again ? Like last time ? I do n't think so . Hope not . Daddy stopped being sad when Nanny Carrie came and lived with us . He liked Nanny Carrie . I know this is probably really hard for you to understand ' cause you 're so little . Nanny Carrie was n't a very nice lady and she needed to go away . I wish Nanny Carrie was my mama . You will stay on Red Bedroom Records , which John will now distribute worldwide . You have final say on touring , image rights and album art , and you get to keep your publishing , which means you own all your own songs . And ? And we get to stay together as a team . - You did it ! - No , you did it with that performance ! That was incredible . Dude , did you see his face when you freaked out on him ? It was awesome . He was practically tripping over himself to give us this deal . You know , it was n't that hard a performance . I meant every word . Except the part when I called you a sell-out , not that part . Well , I think you 've got ta go home and pack your bags now , ' cause you 're opening up in Houston tomorrow . - What ? - Yeah , and for someone who I think that you know . Wait , what ? What 's wrong ? Oh , it 's just ... It all happened so fast . I 'm not sure I 'm ready to say goodbye . No , you 're ready . And it 's not goodbye . This is just the beginning of your dream come true . And I want you to know , I am really , really proud to be a part of it . Now go out there and be great . Okay . I ca n't be alone again . You 're not gon na be . You 're coming home with me . Come here . I love you , Keith . I just hope I can be half as good an uncle to Jamie as you were to me . I miss you . After careful consideration , we have come to a decision . Mr . Scott ... Haley , I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'm sorry for the way this looks , but before you say anything , just know that it 's my fault . She said that you kissed her . Did you ? Daddy 's home ! Hey , buddy . What 's up ? Mommy and I need to talk right now , okay ? So why do n't you go out back and shoot a round ? You know what ? Try to make five free throws in a row and I 'll be out there in a sec , okay ? It 's a simple question , Nathan . Did you kiss her ? No . But she kissed me . You looked me right in the eye and you said that there 's nothing else . You said , " There 's nothing more . " And I have been through a lot with you , Nathan . I 've been through better and worse , and sickness and health , but I will not do infidelity . It was n't like that , okay ? I was n't into her . It was Carrie . Do n't you see ? - No , it 's you . It 's always you . When are you gon na learn ? When are you gon na stop making bad choices that threaten everything that we 've built ? Everything I 've ever done was for this family , Haley . Well , excuse us for being such a weight around your neck . I did n't say that , okay ? And you know I did n't mean that . Do n't put words in my mouth . Well , somebody needs to , because you have a really nasty habit of neglecting to mention important details . Haley , you know what ? I 'm really trying hard to be honest about all this right now , but sometimes , for you , it 's just never enough , okay ? And I ca n't take it anymore . Do not turn it around . Do n't you dare turn it around . You messed up , and it 's ... And the best part is , you screw the nanny and Jamie ends up hating me . I did not screw her ! What ... Where is he ? - Jamie ! Oh , my God . - Jamie . - Jamie ! - Jamie ! Oh , God ! Please , please . Jamie ! - He 's breathing , right ? - I do n't know . Come here . Come here . Jamie . Jamie , open your eyes . Honey , wake up ! Jamie , wake up ! - Okay . - I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . No , you stay away from us ! This marriage is over ! - Haley . - Oh , he 's going ... I want a divorce .

If the ticket 's a mistake you can tell the story to the clerk when we get up there . If I live that long . I 'm sorry , folks , you 'll just have to be patient . The computers are still down . " How do you get five elephants into a compact car ? " - There he is . - Commissioner , look here . No more questions . I 'm sorry . Looks like Edward Nygma 's making a comeback . Yeah , Nygma . He 's deleting all his files from every police database we can access . Look , he 's left no trace of any driver 's license or social security number . No bank accounts , credit cards , no birth certificate . As if he never existed . But what about the hard copies of ... ? Gordon here . What ? Someone just delivered a crate downstairs with question marks painted on it . And it 's ticking . Move it , people . Gordon 's orders . We need this area cleared now . Gently , gently . We 'll never get it open this way . We 've got a variation on the ancient Chinese puzzle box . Of course , this time I do n't have a sledgehammer . - Some kind of threat ? - More like an invitation . Careful , vigilante . You know what they say : Curiosity killed the Bat . These the papers you wanted , Mr . Nygma ? Of course they are . Did you make certain these are the only existing copies ? They 'd better be . Any idea what these are ? We were hoping you could tell us that . I 've got other leads to follow . Meantime , you search every inch of that mainframe . And if you find anything unusual , inform me immediately . " Where does a 500-pound gorilla sleep ? " " What 's worse than a millipede with flat feet ? " And " How do you get five elephants into a compact car ? " Anywhere it wants , a giraffe with a sore throat and two in the front seat , two in back , and one in the trunk . Yeah , yeah , I know . O not corny old jokes like these . Perhaps the questions are the clues , not the answers . For example , they all seem to involve animals . Also numbers . A 500-pound gorilla . A millipede , meaning 1000 legs . And five elephants . Now , let 's convert them to Roman numerals . Look , DMV . - Department of Motor Vehicles . - Department of Motor Vehicles . But I recall you mentioning he 'd already obliterated his records there so why return ? - For the hard copy . NYGMA EDWARD Come on , we 're out of here . Well , I never was any good at parallel parking . And I 'm not too clear on the laws about pedestrian right-of-way either . Now , while you 're disabling my van consider the effect of the imminent collision on the nitroglycerin inside . Your message sounded urgent . Found something ? You bet your ... I mean , yes , sir . It 's a virtual-reality program . What do you mean ? Just watch the screen . A pixel is worth a thousand words . Care to try it , commissioner ? Sort of like playing a computer game from the inside , is n't it ? Amazing , it even feels real . The military 's been experimenting with virtual reality for combat simulation . - And what 's Nygma doing with it ? - Nothing , now . He ca n't access this computer , it 's not hooked up to a phone line . - Why 'd he want us to find it ? - Good question . There 's no way to know till I go through all the files . I should get back to work after I grab a snack . You hungry ? No , thanks . Batman 's young friend is fairly clever , but he does n't have all the answers . Ask me no questions , I 'll tell you no tales . Another riddle , Nygma ? It all makes sense when you add it up . Cent , red cent . Copper , it 's made of copper . And copper is another word for policeman . And " no tails " would be heads . Police , head , quarters . Police headquarters . Bravo , sir . It does make sense when you add it up . And four quarters and one penny make 101 cents . So ... Police headquarters , room 101 . The commissioner . - Virtual reality ? - Quite so , Batman . Everything your commissioner 's experiencing in here seems so real to him , it might as well be real . I give his heart another 15 minutes , at most . He ca n't be online . I searched through every file . You searched the software . Had you bothered to examine the hardware you would have discovered a cordless modem line . I would n't do that , Batman . Disconnecting Gordon would be fatal . The sudden stop would be like slamming into a brick wall at 400 miles an hour . Forget it , the Riddler controls that world . You would n't last a minute . We 'll use these . They 'll let me keep one ear in reality so stay in touch . One door leads to a plane where kings and queens contend . Can you find it ? - Suggestions , partner ? - I 'm working on it . A pity you ca n't earn extra lives in this game . Quite an experience , being riddled with questions , is n't it , Batman ? Batman , do n't open that door . " Crazy intent " means " loco motive . " I suppose you expect me to believe you planned that . But you still have n't found the right door . Batman , I think I figured out the clue . The plane where kings and queens contend could mean a chessboard . Is there a door marked " checkmate " or " black and white " ? " 4096 . " Wait a minute . There are 64 squares on a chessboard , right ? Yeah . Move according to the rules , or it 's the end of the day . Wrong move , Batman . I 've got it . They call you the Dark Knight . Then you have to move like a knight . Two up , one across , because a wrong move means " the end of the day , " or ... " Knight fall , " of course . Nygma , what are you up to now ? And why this ? That is for me to know and you to deduce , Dark Knight . If this is a clue , could it have something to do with the Pegasus ? Do n't look at me . I flunked Greek mythology , remember ? His clues always have a double meaning . So if Pegasus is also the name of a constellation ... Now , astronomy I do know . You 're in Orion now . So you wan na keep going past Taurus . Then hang a sharp right at Andromeda . Things are a little mixed-up here , but I 'm sure you can fix that . Your commissioner is contained within this cube . Solve the puzzle and you gain access . No problemo , Batman . That 's a Baxter 's box . I can guide you through it in ... No coaching from the peanut gallery . You have one minute , Batman . Then the clock strikes 2 . If you can do it , so can I . I should 've known you 'd cheat . Nice try , Batman , but in my world , you play by my rules . You may control this world , Nygma but I still control myself . The name is Riddler . Edward Nygma no longer exists . You might recall that he was once fired by an ungrateful employer . That was a private matter and should 've remained one . Attempted homicide is never a private matter , Nygma . It would 've been if you had n't interfered and turned Nygma into a fugitive . Any number you can think of , we can double . Tell me , Riddler , how can you split your focus in 32 directions and sustain concentration to keep your world together ? - You can't . - No . No ! What happened ? I can escape that easily too . But then , if the planet were equitable I 'd still have my old job . No , no , not yet . No . Looked like he suffered some kind of attack . Like a sensory overload or something . But we 'll never know for sure because we 'll never find him . Oh , no ? Come on . I think he left us a clue . " If the planet were equitable I 'd still have my old job . " Of course : " If the world 's fair I 'd still have my ex-position . " Give me a break . Looks like he did n't escape his virtual reality in time .  
@@5231341    ? NCIS 11x08 ? Alibi Original air date on November 12 , 2013 == sync , corrected by elderman == @elderman ?   All right , Ducky , I 'm done . Thank you , Tim .  You poor dear . Probably did n't even hear it coming . Hey , where 's Tony ? I do n't know . I offered to give him a lift , but he said someone would pick him up . From DC to Quantico ? Sounded strange to me , too . I do n't know how he 's surviving without a car .  Is that him ? No . It 's Delilah . We 're talking about sneaking away for a long weekend .  : Nice . DUCKY : If you hens are finished , I could do with some help . Oh , yes . Her name 's Petty Officer Third Class Jody Ray . Patrol spotted her body just after sunrise . She works at the base clinic . Had been running almost every night for the past few months . Next of kin been notified ? CACO team is on it , sir . All right , thanks . Nice of you to join us , DiNozzo . Yeah , sorry . Hey , Jimmy . So , what did I miss ? Who was it that drove you all the way over here ? Oh . A friend . No , seriously . Seriously . What should I do , photograph ? No , I already did it . Egh . All right . Duck ? Last night , 2200 hours , or thereabouts . McGEE : Hey , Abbs . Come up with anything ? Making progress . Look , okay , this is a part of the vehicle 's headlight assembly . What 's the make and model ? There are 47 manufacturers of cars and trucks in the United States . Each one of those produces multiple models and body styles . And the parts and the trim are redesigned every few years . Thank you very much . But we 're going to have to narrow it down . There 's hundreds of trucks on that base every day . That 's what I was doing when you interrupted me . So , there was a trace of the vehicle 's paint on Petty Officer Ray 's watch . These are our color choices . On the top we have Inferno Red . And the bottom we have Deep Molten Red . I do n't know who comes up with these names . What do you think ? I 'm going to have to go with the top one . Agreed . So Inferno Red was only available between 2005 and 2008 . So the only year in common between the headlight lens and the color is 2005 . Ergo we are looking for a red 2005 Dodge Ram pickup truck . Abby , you are the best . Why do you suspect Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne ? Abby I.D . ' d the make , model and color of the hit-and-run vehicle . Only one registered on base and it belongs to Dunne . I checked the gate security footage . His truck never left Quantico last night . What do we know about him ? Single . Joined the Corps right out of high school . He 's a helo mechanic . Scheduled to deploy on an LHA to the Med , later this week . And most pertinent ... he has a DUI in his past . Bring him in .  : I love it when it all comes together so quickly . Not me . Makes me nervous . Too easy . Let 's go . You ever going to get a new car ? Well , firstly , I never buy new cars . Secondly , I need something that ignites my passions . It 's like a woman . I need to be in love before I commit .  TONY : Sergeant Dunne ! Freeze . NCIS . Yeah , that 's my truck , but I swear , I do n't know how it got that way . You did n't drive it last night ? No . I have n't used the truck in a couple of days . How do you get to work ? I walk . Need the exercise . The maintenance bay is n't that far from my quarters . TONY : Where were you last night , 2200 hours ? I was in my room ... asleep . Had a tough week . I was exhausted . You sure you were n't drunk and you just do n't remember what you did ? We know about your DUI . I 've been sober for 13 months . I go to three or four meetings a week . So , if you were n't driving the pickup and you 're innocent , why were you climbing out a window ? I know my rights . I 'm not saying any more until I have a lawyer . Okay .   Hey , McGee . Did you bring me Sergeant Dunne 's right boot ? Sorry , Abbs , he lawyered up and did n't give a permissive search . Hmm . Well , did you get a good look at his feet ? Huh ? Well , the footprint that you cast at the crime scene , it 's a standard-issue Marine Corps combat boot , size ten and a half . Well , I guess he might wear that size . It 's well worn and has a very distinctive gash in the right heel . I 'd just really love to match it to Sergeant Dunne . Well , you 're going to have to wait till morning . Any luck here ? Oh , this is definitely the pickup truck . The tires match the tracks that were in the dirt . And I got hair , blood and clothing fibers off the front end that match our victim . Hmm . Somebody dropped him off all the way out at Quantico this morning . Is he dating someone ? Oh ... I do n't think so . Hmm .  You always smell so great . Let me guess - - you missed the sexual harassment meeting again this year . Hey , everybody , look who I found in the lobby . GIBBS : Hey , Clark . Hey , guys . McGEE : Morning , Carrie . I do n't think I 've had the pleasure . Dr . Mallard , meet former FBI agent Carrie Clark . Now in private law practice . Nice to meet you , Doctor . Likewise . TONY : Carrie worked the Norfolk side of the Port Authority case a few years ago , made Fornell look good . It was a tough job . No , you guys made it easy . I do n't remember that case . You 're his lawyer ? Say it ai n't so . Yes , where is he ? Staff Sergeant Dunne 's in a holding cell across the yard . Agent McGee can take you to him . Thank you . Good to see you guys . Bye . Duck , you can release Petty Officer Ray 's body any time you 're ready . You notice anything different about Carrie , boss ? No wedding ring . Told you the husband was a handbag . Handbag ? Something useless you hang on your arm . Oh .  Hey , Agent Fornell , it 's DiNozzo . Listen , can you give me the skinny on the ever-fetching Carrie Clark ? Hello . I 'm Carrie Clark . Did n't expect you to look like you do . Is that a problem ? Not if you 're as good as my cousin said . Well , I have n't had any complaints . You 're about to be arraigned on some very serious charges . Any idea who ? Justin , I want to believe you , but you seem very nervous . Is there something that you want to tell me ? Where were you at 10:00 last night ? Does n't matter . Of course it does . I have an alibi . Okay . That 's all you need to know . Are you going to tell me ?  : All right , if that is going to be your attitude , how about I save you some money ? JAG will assign someone to you for free . Hold on . Could this room be bugged ? No , no way - - that would be illegal . Are you recording our conversation ? No . You 're my lawyer . Anything I say , you ca n't tell anyone ? It 's called attorney-client privilege . Everything that you say is confidential . It does n't leave this room unless you want it to . Rules of ethics prohibit me from telling anyone what we discuss . And what were you doing there ? Stabbing a guy to death . Why are you checking airline schedules ? Miami ? Do you have to know everything ? Yes , it 's in my DNA . Well , you 're gon na drive me crazy until I tell you , so ... Things are quiet here , this case is wrapping up . I 've got a few vacation days coming , so Delilah and I have been talking about getting away for a long weekend . McGee , I 'm impressed . Miami , South Beach , hot clubs , stone crabs . It is unlike you . I knew I should n't have said anything . TONY : Oh . That did n't take long . Your client come to his senses ? Thank you . Wants to confess ? No . Wants to make a deal , then ? Sergeant Dunne says he 's innocent . Innocent ? We 've forensically tied his pickup to the victim . He ran when we tried to question him . Well , it is not that simple , Gibbs , he told me in confidence . It 's privileged . If he does n't want to tell you himself , then my hands are tied . We 've got 48 hours to either charge him or let him go . Give us something . All right , listen , I will go check out his alibi myself and I will get back to you . The guy 's facing vehicular homicide and hit-and-run charges . He wo n't use an alibi ? Is he crazy ? Abbs . Gibbs ... you 're amazing . How did you know that someone else was driving the truck ? What 'd you find ? Well , it 's more what I did n't find that 's interesting . I mean , before you called , I was just trying to match the victim to the vehicle , which I did . Just Staff Sergeant Dunne 's ? No . I mean , like none , nada , zip , zilch , nothing . Almost the entire surface of the truck was wiped clean of fingerprints - - the door handle , the steering wheel , the gearshift , the seat adjuster , everything . Now , I got reminded o-of my Uncle Horace . He was always losing things like his glasses and his wallet and his keys . He got locked out of his own car so many times that he , he hid a key on his car . And then I found ... this ...  ... under the front wheel well . Wiped clean ? Oh , yeah , including the key inside . That is hardly something that the owner would do . Someone else was driving the truck . Yes , and they tried to make it look like they were n't . Thanks , Abbs . I do n't understand why people run . I 'll tell you , running gives me a great high . I was referring to the driver running from the scene of the accident , Mr . Palmer . Oh , yes , yes . Did you know that pedestrian hit-and-runs are at an epidemic rate in this country ? Nearly 11% of all traffic accidents in the United States are hit-and-runs . That Petty Officer Ray ? Yes . Hold on to the body for a little while longer , will you , Duck ? You signed the release . Has something changed ? Yeah .  But I do n't know what . Yeah , it 's Gibbs . Hi , it 's Carrie Clark . Yeah , Carrie , what do you got ? Well , Dunne 's alibi checks out , it 's solid . Mm-hmm , tell me . I ca n't . You 're going to have to start looking for the real hit-and-run driver because it 's not my client . Jethro , is something wrong ? Looks like you wo n't be leaving us today after all , my dear . McGee , trace the last call , will you ? You want me to find out who it was from ? It was from Carrie Clark . Usually her name comes up on that little window there . This time it did n't ; it was just a number . Hmm . What did she say ? Said her client 's alibi checked out . I do n't believe it . Well , the number belongs to a pay phone . Pay phone ? I did n't think there were any left . 325 Acacia Avenue in Falls Church . It 's in front of the library . Carrie has a cell . Why would she use a pay phone ? Not sure . She knows her client 's alibi . She knows she ca n't tell us . Go . Go on . There 's the pay phone . Why was Carrie calling from here ? McGEE : Library , hardware store ? Oh , there we go , Great Sexpectations . I seriously doubt it , Tony . Hey , there 's a squad car . Yeah , let 's check it out .  Did you ever find out if Carrie was divorced ? Ah . Trial separation . She 's not wearing her ring . You know what that means . It 's over . Hey . NCIS . Special Agents DiNozzo and McGee . Dockry , Homicide . Homicide ? What are you guys up to ? Oh , just pounding the pavement , boring Navy stuff . Yeah , nothing serious like homicide . Who 's dead ? Store owner-- Donny Sullivan . Stabbed to death night before last . Body was found in the upstairs residence yesterday morning by an employee . Any leads ? Nothing concrete yet . Hey , do you guys know a Special Agent Gibbs ? Oh , yeah , we affectionately refer to him as " boss . " Tell him Hickory 's son said hi . Hickory ? He 'll know . The storekeeper 's murder happened about the same time as the hit-and-run . Think this has something to do with Dunne 's alibi ? If Dunne was involved , then how 'd he get from Quantico to here and back ? His truck never left the base . I think your amorous little weekend in Miami just went bye-bye .  : Yeah . Gibbs . Hey , boss . We might have a lead on Dunne 's alibi . Find out what you can - - discreetly , DiNozzo . Gibbs , Gibbs , Gibbs , so I told you that I dusted the entire truck for prints , but I did n't . Thumbprint have a name ? Do n't be silly , Gibbs , thumbprints do n't have names . People do . My first pass was to run it against all the personnel at Quantico .  And that 's all I had to do . Private Daniel Cliff . Gibbs will be in , in a minute . Thank you . You know why they brought me over here ? No . I told them I would n't say anything else until my lawyer was present . Well , I checked your alibi . You were n't lying . Hey , you do n't know who 's on the other side of that glass . Let 's not discuss it again . You know all you have to . I 'm innocent . Could n't this have waited till the morning ? Nope . You know him ? Yeah , Private Cliff - - I see him around . You two close ? No . You give Private Cliff permission to drive your pickup truck ? Hell , no . What was that about ? Gibbs ? Sounds like you have a suspect for your hit-and-run . You gon na let my client go ? Not yet . Come on . He 's due to deploy . Have n't brought Private Cliff in for questioning yet . Well , your 48-hour clock is ticking . If you do n't charge my client by tomorrow , you have to let him go . You know , a funny thing happened . We got a tip . Sent us to a cigar store in Falls Church . Really ? Yeah , it was a crime scene , a homicide . If your client was n't driving his truck on base the other night , could he have been in Falls Church ? My only concern is Sergeant Dunne 's rights . He was n't involved in the hit-and-run . Hmm . She did n't say " no . "  Oh , you 're crazy . No , you must need glasses . Yeah , yeah . All right , later . What 's so funny ? That was Hollander in HR . She claims that she saw you this morning at the front gate getting off a city bus . Yeah , that was me . Listen , I know I made fun of you in the past for riding the bus , but I have to admit I was wrong . I 've been using public transportation , and I really like it . You 're kidding . No . I have time to read , make some calls and , best of all ... I get to watch people . People are fascinating . Okay , Tony , I 'm ... I do n't even know what I am right now . But I know you , and this is not you . Boss , I went through Sergeant Dunne 's e-mails , phone calls and credit cards . What would his motive be to kill the guy ? Did find out Dunne exchanged a lot of calls with a Maryland cell phone number . Belongs to an Olivia Chandler . Yeah , well , find out who she is . Yup . Hmm . Do we dare run Sergeant Dunne 's name by Falls Church PD , see if they can make a connection ? Ca n't do that . Got to protect Carrie Clark . You can do it off the record . The homicide detective in charge seemed to know you . Who ? Well , he said to tell you , " Hickory 's son says hello . "  That 's Paul Dockry . Hickory Dickory Dockry . His dad and I were in the Corps together . Come on , DiNozzo . You 're with me . Huh . People are fascinating . This boot print was found at a crime scene that killed a petty officer . This is the same boot , the same cutout at the right heel .  What happened ? It was dark . I could n't see her until it was too late . What were you doing with Staff Sergeant Dunne 's truck ? I had a few drinks . I know this girl in Stafford . I overheard Dunne in the rec room . Said he had a rough week and was gon na hit the rack early . Figured I 'd take his truck and be back before he even missed it . Bull ! How 'd you know about the hidden key ? About a year ago , when he was still drinking , he got wasted , locked himself out of his truck . Got the hidden key out , had me drive him home . You left an injured woman to die by the side of the road ? No ! I stopped . I knew she was dead , and I realized how bad it all looked . I was drinking , I was driving a stolen vehicle . I just panicked and drove back to the parking lot . Uh-uh . If we charge Private Cliff with the hit-and-run , we got to let Staff Sergeant Dunne go . I 'm not ready to do that . We only have a few more hours until the clock runs out on Dunne . Put him in a holding cell . Hey , Paul . Hey , Gibbs . Sorry . Just give me a sec . I got to finish this text to my daughter . Only way she 'll communicate me . The kid never answers her phone . Been a long time . How 's your dad ? Stubborn as always . Thought I might run into you at my kid sister 's wedding . Oh , no , no . I 'm not ... I 'm not big on weddings . I can understand that . Thanks for meeting me . Yeah . I ran into your agents in Falls Church . Taking it , that was n't a coincidence . Uh , no . Seems to have an alibi , but he may have been involved with your dead storekeeper . Like to talk to him . Ca n't let you , not yet . Still trying to protect a source . You have him in custody . Yeah , for the time being . What can you tell me about your case ? Discovered Sullivan was a bookie . Used the cigar store as a front . Guy you holding like to gamble ? I 'll find out . You got any suspects for the murder ? Yes ... and no . Loser with a mile-long rap sheet , Wendell Kaiser . Into Sullivan big-time . Very public arguments . Kaiser even makes threats . However , airtight alibi . In New York at the time of the murder . Just got back this morning . Hmm . Maybe alibis are in season , huh ? ELAINE : Okay . Cheeseburger , no dressing , fries . Did I miss something ? You did n't even order . Well , he does n't have to . I 'll e-mail you the highlights . Your guy would n't happen to be a hit man for hire , would he ? No . I do n't think so . What ? Need something ? Yeah , a knife to cut this beast . That 'll work . TONY : No , no , no . You 're not serious . There 's no way she 's married to him . Almost five years .  The very definition of a trophy wife . What you looking at ? Olivia Chandler . The woman who Sergeant Dunne has been exchanging texts and calls with . That little man must have a big , big ... bank account . She 's married to him . They live together in Chevy Chase Village . Very la-dee-dah . Only thing on her record is a DUI . She was picked up for driving erratically in her Aston Martin . So many jokes . Of course she drives an Aston Martin . Olivia Chandler 's car . Now , this was taken a block from the cigar store . Because of the tinted windows , you ca n't make out who 's inside . I sent it to Abby . It 's a long shot , but maybe she can enhance the image . Sullivan was a bookie . Falls Church police had a suspect , but he has an alibi . Detective Dockry said he was going to e-mail the file . McGEE : He did . Wendell Kaiser . McGee - - see if Staff Sergeant Dunne had a gambling problem or any connection to this guy . DiNozzo ... check out Olivia Chandler . With pleasure . Thank you , boss .   May I help you ? Oh , I hope so . NCIS Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo . NCIS ? I love this car . It 's smoking hot . I 'm in the market myself . Between vehicles right now . Terrible gas mileage , but that 's what James Bond drives . Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne . How do you know him ? I do n't . Really ? ' Cause you exchanged a lot of calls with him , and that would suggest otherwise . We met at an A.A . meeting . We talk to each other for support . Sobriety is an ongoing battle . So why 'd you say you did n't know him ? The second " A " in A.A . is for " anonymous . " I should n't be talking about him or anyone else . Gotcha . So you 're taking a little trip ? I 'm going to Jamaica with some girlfriends .  : Yeah , mon . Jamaica . Well , have yourself a nice time . GIBBS : Did you connect Staff Sergeant Dunne to the dead bookie or the Falls Church suspect ? No , not yet . Based on the people I 've talked to , it appears that Dunne 's not a gambler .  Tony , you got something ? TONY : Oh , yeah . You wo n't believe how hot Olivia Chandler is . Photos do n't do her justice . What 's with her and Staff Sergeant Dunne ? Well , she claims they 're only acquaintances from A.A . meetings . But I think it 's more than that . You said you had Dunne 's credit card charges - - put them up . Why ? Trust me , put them up there . All right , what are we looking for ? Well , if they 're doing what I think they 're doing , they 're not doing it at her place . And I do n't think a rich housewife from Chevy Chase is dragging those long legs all the way down to Quantico . Okay , wait . Hold on . Chevy Chase Lodge . There , there and there . Three nights , probably more . Take it down , McGee . Our 48 hours are up . Yep . That 's one case closed , another wide open . MAN : Yes , dear , I understand . WOMAN : Do you ? Do you even hear ? I hear you . No , no , no . I-I would never ...  Well ... oh , it 's your mother 's idea ? Yes , it 's my mother 's idea ! Why does that not surprise me ?  I have to go . I have a guest waiting .  I do have a guest waiting . I 'm not making that up .  Uh ... could you help me , please , sir ? Who is that ? Hello ? Okay . I 'll call you later . Fine ! Like hell I will .  You married ? Oh . No . Uh ... I 'm a federal agent . DiNozzo . Like to ask a few questions . All right , federal agent , ask away ... ? Well , he 'd like me to think that . No , his friend never comes to the lobby . He parks the car , and she goes directly to the room . So you got to figure , you know , one or both are married , right ? Right . Yeah .  So you 've never seen her ? Well , actually , I did the old knock-on-the-wrong-door routine one time . She look like this ? Yeah , that 's her . Woman like that , you do not forget . Right ? I mean , can you imagine what one night with ...  I swear , the old witch is psychic . If I have so much as a thought of another woman ... You do n't have to answer that . I have to . What ... ? ! ... do you want ? I got it . Good luck . Just , do you need ... if ... Take a card , sir . Thank you . What 's on your mind ? Well , curiously , I was about to ask you that . You 've seemed ... troubled since you took that call in Autopsy yesterday . Usually you 're a master at hiding your feelings . That your professional opinion ? The occupational hazard of working with a profiler . Mmm . Yeah , I 'm fine . A little concerned about Carrie Clark . The lawyer ? Yeah , she 's good . She got her client released without being charged . I sense a " but . " Well , she does have a conscience . Well , that 's a good thing , is n't it ? We learned some things about her client that she may or may not have led us to . Privileged information ? Doc , I got to be careful how I handle this . For Carrie 's sake . She could get disbarred . Well , I know you , Jethro . Tchaikovsky 's Second . I never realized that he wrote music for the movies .  That 's a car I 've always had the hots for . Maybe that 's what I should get . It 's too old . You ca n't drive a car like that . It 's not practical . That 's the problem with you , McGeezer . Everything has to be practical . What ... What I mean is , I 've never known you to do anything even a little risqu ? . Tony , you have no idea what I do on my time off . You know , that 's true , I do n't . Why do n't you tell me ? Share . Rock me . Sock me . Well , there 's Wendell Kaiser . Wonder if Falls Church PD is tailing him , too . Kaiser 's their suspect .  Is Kaiser going to church ? No . It 's an A.A . meeting . They meet here every morning at this time . Reverend Miller , I , uh ... Bringing a new member ? Um ... He 's thinking about it . A little gun-shy . McGee , the Rev . Please join us . It 's a very safe place . All are welcome . Tony , what 's going on ? Do you have a drinking problem ? No . No , I just ... I joined this men 's support group . Meets in the church hall two nights a week . You serious ? Mm-hmm . I know , it ... it does n't sound like me , but ... with the past year , I just ... wanted to shake things up a little bit . Meet some new people . This guy at the gym told me about the group , and I thought it sounded like a good idea . And it ... it is , it 's fun . The Rev drove me to Quantico the other morning . Interesting guy . He 's helping me be less judgmental . We should get back . TONY : Sergeant Dunne , Olivia Chandler and Wendell Kaiser all have one thing in common . They all go to A.A . meetings . That 's probably where they met . The sergeant and the trophy wife are lovers . The desk clerk at the Chevy Chase Lodge said that they were regulars . It 's just like that movie Body Heat . William Hurt and Kathleen Turner . God , she was really something , boss . A head turner . But I digress . Anyway , they were young lovers , just like these two , and they wanted the rich husband 's money and him out of the way . McGEE : On the other hand , you 've got Wendell Kaiser , who 's deep in debt to his bookie and needs him off his back . TONY : So they help each other out and switch murders . McGEE : While Kaiser was in New York , Dunne killed the bookie with Olivia 's help . She drove him . Her car was in the vicinity . TONY : Tomorrow Sergeant Dunne is going to deploy and Olivia Chandler is off to Jamaica . And I 'm betting that while they 're away , her husband 's going to have a terrible accident at the hands of Mr . Kaiser here , a man with whom he has no connection . Two murders , three solid alibis . Interesting theory . We know it 's going to be a hard conspiracy for us to prove . We got to be careful - - it 's not our case . There 's a way . Find the weak link .  Hey , Kaiser . You got a minute ? Detective Dockry . I thought we were done . Look , I told you everything I know about Sullivan . Yeah , well , something 's come up . Let 's go to the station . We can talk about it . Nah , I 'm not going anywhere . Look , I had nothing to do with Sullivan 's murder . We know about your buddy , Sergeant Dunne , and his girlfriend . So let me explain how this works . First suspect to flip on the others gets the deal . ? Olivia Chandler . Hey , Gibbs . DiNozzo told me that if you were n't at home I would probably find you here .  Have a seat . There a problem ? No , I ... just heard that Falls Church PD arrested my former client , Sergeant Dunne . Really ? Yeah , they booked him on multiple charges , including conspiracy to commit murder and murder one . How 'd they get him ? Apparently one of his coconspirators turned state 's evidence . Sometimes ... you get lucky . Mmm , is that what it was ? They got a warrant and cinched the case against Dunne when they found the murder weapon , a knife , in his bathroom toilet tank .  That 's great . I got Dunne off on the hit-and-run . Yeah , you did it well . Yes , and whatever happened to him after that , it 's not my concern . Justice was served , all around . Okay . Here you go . Care to join me for dinner ? Hmm , meat loaf and mashed potatoes ? My favorite . I would be happy to . Coming right up . Thanks , Elaine . I think that you and me have a few things in common . == sync , corrected by elderman == @elderman

So tell me , what does HARDAC do ? Now , Bruce , I ca n't tell you all of my secrets , can I ? Well , since you wo n't tell me what you 're working on , Karl maybe I can charm details out of your lovely assistant . Well , you can try . Some people in high places are becoming too curious about this operation . I 'll get it , princess . You keep hitting those books . What the devil ? ! Were you outside ? Your hand is like ice . I 'm fine . - Dad , are you sure ... ? - I said , I 'm fine . I heard your voice , Ms . Duane , and thought Master Bruce had returned . HARDAC , I 've definitely found something . Bruce Wayne is Batman . Computer , scan Batcave for ... What ? Good heavens ! I 've lost it . The link was shut down at the source . Could Randa have been down here ? I should hope not . But I ca n't say for certain , sir . L ... I simply ca n't remember anything beyond the time you left . It 's all right , Alfred . We 'd better search the house . Search for what , Master Bruce ? Anything unusual . She may have left a clue I can use . She 's only human . Yes , I understand . That 's no problem . The Gotham Club would be ideal . I 'll take care of Bruce Wayne . Dad , who are you talking to ? Leave me alone . - You wanted me , commissioner ? - Go to Cybertron and see Randa Duane . She has something for you . I already took a statement from Rossum . They ai n't involved . Do it , lieutenant . Talk to this guy . Talk to that guy . I 'm getting a sore throat . Wayne . Meet me at the Gotham Club in one hour . I will , commissioner . And thanks for ... The duplicant processor 's been used . I did n't authorize that . It was necessary to serve your ultimate purpose . No , it was a stupid idea . The babblings of a broken heart . Humans make errors in judgment . It is sometimes necessary to protect them from their own inadequacies . I 've let this go too far . I gave you too much free will . It 's time to change your programming . You have immobilized the maker . His human imperfection endangers the plan . He must be improved upon . It 's open . What on earth ? Commissioner ? No , Batman . I called you . - I expected your father , Ms . Gordon . - That 's why I called you . - That man is not my father . - What do you mean he 's not your father ? Just what I said . He 's so cold to me . But it 's not just that . I ca n't put my finger on it . But I know he 's not my father . I know I sound crazy , but I 'm not . Whoever 's downstairs now , it looks like Jim Gordon , talks like him , but it 's not him . Please help me , Batman . - I 'll do what I can . - Thank you . Getting a little fresh air ? How come I was n't invited to this little get-together ? It 's suddenly less pleasant up here . Excuse me . Not so fast , Batman . A robot ? Yes . More advanced than anything I 've ever seen . - Does that mean my father ... ? - I do n't know . I 'll find out tonight . Do n't go home . Stay at a friend 's house . Not so fast . Please , let go of my cape . Batman , I ... Good evening , Bruce . I 'm glad you could come . Nice to see you , mayor . Is Commissioner Gordon here ? He 'll be along . He wo n't wan na miss this . You 're going to become a member of a very exclusive club tonight . I thought I already belonged to every exclusive club in Gotham . Oh , no , my boy . This club is brand-new . Though everyone will belong very soon . Randa ! Is this what I get for leaving in the middle of dinner ? You know what they say about a woman scorned , Bruce . Do n't let him get away ! " Wait at a friend 's house , " he says . Not likely , Woobie . Bullock went to Cybertron and a robot came back . Wan na bet Dad 's there too ? Miss Gordon , your skill at breaking and entering is impressive . What have you done with my father ? He 's right here , my dear . You 'll be joining him soon . Very soon . Enough . It 's over , Batman . People are imperfect . They make mistakes . Your mistake was coming here to interfere with the plan . What is this plan ? The plan was conceived by Karl Rossum when his young daughter was deactivated . - Deactivated ? You mean ... - A vehicular accident . Our maker felt the emotion called love in great quantity for her . Afterwards , he decided to find a way to replace humans whose decisions can cost other human lives . - But we 're all capable of human error . - Precisely . The maker 's concept was sound , but he did not go far enough . Which is why I have taken over . - Does that mean my father 's ... ? - No . There is still much to learn from humans .

I 'm sure the investigation will prove exactly that . You did well . Thanks . - Anytime . - I 'm getting too old for this kind of stuff . I sort of enjoyed it . Come on , sweetie .

We have n't seen him in a while . What 's he doing ?  Same as me - - Reading Alien Invaders comics . Wow !  This is the best issue ...  ... of Alien Invaders yet ! Invasion of the Bug-Eyed Terminators . Awesome ! What ? Oh , no ! It 's the bug-eyed terminators . They 're here . I got ta warn somebody .  Police precinct . Sergeant O'Flahrety speaking . The bug-eyed terminators have landed ! They 've invaded a building at the corner of 5th and Robertson !  The terminators ? We 're on our way , me boy . And you stay away from them . Attention all units in the area of 5th and Robertson . Not to me . You should have seen my date last night . Let 's check it out , anyway . There may be a story .    The aliens are in there !  ? What are you doing here ? Oh , hi ,  , Irma . I 'm the one one who reported the invasion . Look ! The police nabbed those aliens . Get this on tape , Irma . Huh ? They 're not bug-eyed aliens . They 're bug-busters . Swell . We 've scooped the other stations with a story about an invasion of pest exterminators .  At this moment , the police are talking to the boy ,  , who called in this report of an alien invasion , apparently as a prank . But they looked just like Martians ! Martians ? What 's gotten into  ? Well , offhand , I 'd say the latest issue of Alien Invasion comics . It appears  's imagination has gotten the better of him .  The Teenage Mutant Ninja  said they 'd meet us here . I guess we 're early . Swell . I 'll go grab a pizza , little bro . You get a table .  Alien Robots ! Robots are invading the mall ! You got ta warn people ! Sure , kid . First thing after lunch . Why wo n't anyone believe me ? Excuse me , sir . I need your piano .  You robots ca n't invade this mall without a fight ! Look what you 've done to our robots .

What is making  act like this ?  And when 's he gon na stop ? Not real soon , or this is gon na be a real short episode .   calling the Teenage Mutant Ninja  ! Yeah , this is  . What 's up ,  ? I just saw alien slime monsters coming out of an excavation on Hill Street . Oh , come on ,  . Another one ? Really , I did see ' em . Honest . Here , see for yourselves . Holy guacamole ! They do look like slime monsters ! Maybe this time  is telling the truth . Boy , you made it just in time ,  . The slime monsters are just coming out now !  Whoa !  is right ! Those are slime monsters ! I 'd recognize them anywhere ... after reading Alien Invaders . We 'll stop ' em . Right ! Let 's hose ' em ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Hold it !  Uh , sorry guys . Ha ha . Our mistake . Hey , anytime , guys . We needed to clean up , anyway . Gee , fellas , I 'm sorry . I could have sworn they were slime monsters . Right . Just like those alien robots in the mall ? Oh . You saw that , huh ? Yeah . We also saw your busting of the bug busters . Look ,  , we appreciate your trying to help , but this is one false  too many . Yeah , you 're right . I guess I do n't deserve to be a Turtle anymore .  Maybe it 's for the best . Just until you get your imagination under control . Hey , you 'll always be our fifth Turtle , micro-dude .

Another crazy assignment . How are we supposed to locate this giant bug , anyway ? Something tells me we already have . Those construction workers are running away from something . Sounds like a plan to me . It 's also one big scoop ! Oh , no . It sees us .  ! It 's coming this way ! Good . We can use some close-up footage . Uhh ! Uhh !  ! Help me ! I 've fallen , and I ca n't get up ! Hang on , Irma ! I 'll think of something !  But what ?     ! Help me ! Do n't go away , Irma ! I 'll be right back ! I hope I can figure out how to do this .  Got it ! That should hold it until the police arrive . Hold on . That looks like  's Turtle mask . I better contact the  . That is  's mask . Thanks for alerting us ,  .  ? Where is he ? He 's at Ten-Hut Military Academy , and we 're headed there right now .  Now we will create the final soldier for our army of conquest . No , wait ! Do n't ! Put on your disguise , numbskull ! Oh , yeah . I forgot .  The service is kinda slow here . Yeah , and where are all the kids ? Yeah ? What do you want ? Uh , we 'd like to see one of your students . His name is  . Well , you ca n't .

Come on . Let 's go . doorsclose , @engine_starts  Your friends are gone ! And now to proceed with our plans !  , put him into the Mind Changer ! Right ,  . Soon you will be under our control . Hey , if it 's all right , I 'll just hang out for a while . Whoa ! Mondo notion , dude ! So what 's the plan ? Well , since we ca n't get in the front , we go to the back .  I figure we 'll use the Turtle Van 's catapult to get ourselves over the fence . That sounds good , especially the over part . Ready or not , here we come ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Uhh ! Uhh ! You know , we could have just climbed over . I got a feeling there 's something weird going down up there . No wonder . Look at all the power they 're using . I 'll shut it down . That 'll buy us time .  Hey , let 's check out what 's happening to our little bud . Hey , something happened to the power . Well , do n't just hang there , go fix it ! Ow ! Oh , I wish I knew how other bats do that . Holy guacamole !  was right . Oops . Okay . The power 's back on . Uhh ! Earthling intruders !  Now what 's going on ! Did you see that ? A giant mosquito . They must have some humongous frogs in that dude 's swamp .  !  ! Do n't sweat it , bud . We 'll get you out of there . Look out !  Hey ! Let go ! Ha ha ha ! The intruders ! Are you from another planet , too ? They 're the Teenage Mutant Ninja  , and you 'd better let ' em go ! Oh . The ones who were going to rescue you ?  You two will make fine soldiers in my invasion army . Invasion army ? They 've turned all the kids into mindless zombies . I wonder if they did it by letting them watch too much television . No , they did it with this machine : a mind changer . And now we 're gon na change your minds ! Uhh ! Uhh ! And that 's coming from a 5-foot-tall talking turtle .    , any sign of  or  ? Not a clue ,  . They must be inside the school grounds . We 'll soon find out .  Three for the price of one ! Oh , I feel my mind emptying out completely . What mind ? I got an idea . The power for this Mind Changer comes from that central electrode . If we can short it out -- Good idea ,  , but we 're kinda tied up right now .  I 'll get my honorary Ninja Turtle badge . Got it ! Now to toss it ! You did it ! It 's a regular  attack .  Power overload ! Uhh !  Whoa ! Uh-oh .  We got ta save the other kids ! Lead the way ,  . We got ta get ' em to chase us so the kids can get away ! Cowabunga ! There they go ! Stop them ! Destroy them !  Whoa ! Uh-oh . Dead end . I hate being a sitting turtle . I believe the term is duck ! Good idea . Okay , fellas . Now !  Great work , guys ! Our army ! Gone ! Now what do we do ? We buzz off , that 's what .    Ow ! Uhh ! That was an actual spaceship . Then  was right . There really were alien invaders . And  gave me back my TurtleCom . I 'm an honorary Turtle again . I 'm so sorry , dear . We should have believed you when you told us about those alien invaders . It 's not your fault , Mom . I mean , who believes kids anyway ? Well , from now on , I do ... this kid , anyway .  , onTV And so young  is an overnight hero for helping to thwart an alien invasion . The city thanks him . That 's great ! Now  is a hero .

@@5232141 Torres to Voyager . I could use a little help here . What 's your status ? I 'm approaching your position , but that ion storm blew out my deflector field . I 've lost helm control , and I 'm venting plasma from the port nacelle . We 're modifying a tractor pulse to slow you down . Acknowledged . The arresting fields are in place . You 're clear to land . Hold on , B'Elanna . This is going to be bumpy . B'Elanna ? Oh . Are you alive ? You tell me . You 've got a mild concussion . That 's the best thing that 's happened to me all day . When I give you an order , I expect you to follow it . I told you to return to Voyager , not chase the probe into the center of an ion storm . We only have one multispatial probe . I did n't want to lose it . We only have one B'Elanna Torres . I do n't want to lose her , either . Understood . Lanna ... That 's what my mother used to call me . Well , then , I 'm in good company . Come in . Feeling better ? I 've felt worse . I found something you might be interested in . It 's what my ancestors called a " monkey wrench . " It was lodged in your port nacelle . How did it get there ? Judging by your sensor logs , it looks like you ran into it after your deflector field collapsed . But the big question is : How did it get in this quadrant ? What do you mean ? What ? It 's Klingon . And it 's old . That 's about all we know . Looks like the Klingons beat Starfleet to the Delta Quadrant by a few hundred years . You may be holding the most important archaeological find in Klingon history . Remind me to plant a flag on behalf of the Empire . Maybe so . In any case , it makes a nice souvenir . Harry , it bled , it screamed . There 's got to be some explanation . Hey , I 've got one for you . You hit your head harder than you thought . I was n't hallucinating . Now , run a submolecular scan . How many more scans are we going to run ? There is nothing there . No fluid or vapor residue . We may find some irregularities at the atomic level . It 's a hunk of metal . What you heard may have had nothing to do with this artifact . Maybe the com system picked up some stray signal from a pulsar- - I do n't know . A pulsar that speaks Klingon . Okay , B'Elanna , there probably is some explanation for what happened , but it 's 0300 hours . I 'm tired , you 're tired . Let 's just stick this thing in a containment field and deal with it in the morning . Ah ! Neelix , I ran into it with a shuttle . Some of the greatest discoveries in Klingon history were accidents . When Sarpek the Fearless unearthed the Knife of Kiromm he was searching for his lost targ . Is n't that amazing ? I 've been doing some research . Why ? Well , I 'm planning a celebration . This ... must be the treasure . Neelix , look , I appreciate your enthusiasm , but since I 'm the only Klingon onboard , there 's really no point in throwing a party . Oh , nonsense . This artifact is n't just a testament to Klingon spirit . It 's a piece of the Alpha Quadrant- - a symbol of Voyager 's home , and that 's just as worthy of celebration and song as finding some old knife . Man 's got a point . Besides , I 've already replicated five barrels of bloodwine . I 'm not going to let them go to waste . Festivities begin at 1900 hours . Oh ! Sounds like you got a big day ahead of you . You should probably get some rest . All right , all right , let 's call it a night . Thank you . Do not underestimate the power of the mind . The artifact was a catalyst for your already active imagination . It served as an unwelcome reminder of your ancestry- - the self- loathing you experience when you look in the mirror and see a Klingon . Who said anything about self- loathing ? You despise being Klingon . It 's no secret . What you experienced in your quarters was a subconscious manifestation of that hatred . The blood in your veins , the voices of your ancestors- - all symbols of your Klingon heritage . And when the blood disappeared , that was , what ? Me trying to vaporize that part of myself ? Yes . But the essence of who you are- - the artifact itself- - remained . That 's an intriguing theory . Perhaps we should forego your meditation in favor of a different exercise . Fine by me . This should be interesting . Feel the weight of the bat'leth in your hands . Describe the first thought that enters your mind . It 's a clumsy weapon , overstated , like everything else Klingon . You ca n't see the elegance of its design , because of your hatred . I do n't hate Klingons . It 's a warrior 's blade ... crafted for precision and balance . Observe . is this your idea of therapy ? ! Listen to yourself whine like a Ferengi . pahtk ! You 're not worthy of the blood in your veins . A true Klingon would try to kill me where I stand . What the hell has gotten into you ? This exercise is over . You are dismissed , Lieutenant , and take your dishonor with you . ... ejdahk- so - TAS ghos va Skral byteek ... And the river Skral ran crimson red . I fail to see the merit of learning a Klingon drinking song . It 's not about drinking , Seven . It 's about saluting the noble deeds of our ancestors and honoring those who fell in battle . Think " Qapla ' ! " Think " Long live the Empire ! " Think again . Okay , so I 'm overdoing it a bit , but try to get into the spirit of the occasion . Very well . Ej im- ta fey DE- ja i ejdahk- so - TAS ghos va Skral byteek Empa jaj law- moch jaj- push jaj Kahless Molor- migh hohk- chew koo . gagh , anyone ? Sop joq jih yuv gagh drek ! He said , " Eat this or he 'll force it down the gullet of your corpse . " No offense . Oh , none taken . So this is replicated , right ? Unfortunately . And how do you get it to ... They 're all doing this for you . Well , then they do n't know me very well . And if you even think of joining in on this " embrace your heritage " nonsense , I swear I 'll rip out your tongue and wear it as a belt . Oh , no ... there 's not a lot of Klingon in you . I inherited the forehead and the bad attitude- - that 's it . She would have loved all this . Your mother ? She was so obsessed with Klingon ritual , myths . It used to drive my father and me crazy . Did I ever tell you that she put me in a Klingon monastery ? Ah . You 're kidding . It was after their marriage ended . She pulled me out of the Federation school in order to teach me ... honor and discipline . Hmm ... out of the plasma cooker into the fire . Ladies and gentlemen , could I have your attention , please ? I hate to interrupt the festivities , but before I turn the floor over to our resident Klingon , I 'd like to say a few words . This is a great day for the Klingon Empire- - a day when we honor their ancestors . Those warriors whose deeds of valor and glory ... led them to the Delta Quadrant . May they live on in song and story . Captain ! legh soh va Gre'thor ! Where am I ? Silence . The dead ask no questions . Computer , end program ! Qem nuh meq ! Let go of me ! Wait ... wait ... ' uch ghaH . Uh , wait ... She wo n't take the mark . What the hell is going on ? Qusdaq . ba'daH . mag hoshonaH nes'a . Where am I ? You should know ; you 're half Klingon . Enlighten me . This is the Barge of the Dead . Our dishonored souls are being taken to Gre'thor . Imagine my surprise . But I was on Voyager with my crew . That was the naj- - the dream before dying . When we ca n't accept that we 've died , we create the illusion of life to hold on to . He slaughtered my friends . No . He slaughtered the dream . He dragged you from the illusion of life . This is where you belong . What is that ? It 's the kos'kari . They 'll try to lure you to them . Do n't listen . B'Elanna , are you there ? Lieutenant , can you hear me ? Help us find you ! Tom ? Chakotay ? It 's not your friends ! jiH qoy soh ! There are things here worse than death . You . is this the mongrel child you spoke of ? Yes . The one whose face would not bear the mark . B'Elanna , daughter of Miral ... it 's not your time . How do you know my name ? You 've come close to boarding this ship many times . Your curiosity was as deep as the water . I fell in . I almost drowned . When your mother breathed life back into your lungs she told you about me . So you 're supposed to be Kortar . Ah ... you remember me . I remember the myth of Kortar , the first Klingon . He destroyed the gods who created him . And as punishment , I was condemned to ferry the souls of the dishonored to Gre'thor . I may have believed in you as a child , but not anymore . If you did n't still believe , you would n't be here . Foolish girl . You can not harm me . I 'm already dead . What 's happening ? The soul of another dishonored warrior is being delivered . kot'mah soh Gre'thor ! Qapla . Mother . It 's all right . You 're safe . Your shuttle was drifting on the trailing edge of an ion storm . You lost life support . We found you just in time . When we tractored your shuttle back to Voyager , you were in a coma . We almost lost you . The Klingon artifact ... Artifact ? My hand ... You took quite a beating out there- - more than your fair share of cuts and bruises . Come in . How are you feeling ? Um ... a little out of place . Would you like to talk about it ? Yes ... and no . Let me know when you decide . I do n't know how to say this without sounding crazy . Try . Do you believe in an afterlife ? I accept there are things in the universe than ca n't be scanned with a tricorder . What happened to you out there ? I think ... I died . I died , and I was on the Barge of the Dead , in the Klingon afterlife . Klingon mythology has been ingrained in you since you were a child . It 's not surprising you experienced some of those images while you were unconscious . I saw my mother , Chakotay ... your mother ... the Barge of the Dead ... these are just symbols . It 's your subconscious mind trying to tell you something . Tell me what ? That my mother is going to hell ? You need time to digest what you experienced . You have to interpret the symbols and search for their meaning . What if there is no symbolism to interpret ? What if the afterlife is real ? I 'm an engineer . My whole life , I 've immersed myself in science and ... and schematics . But what if it 's time to start looking beyond that ? My grandfather used to ... think he could transform himself into a wolf , so that he could venture out to explore the spirit realm . It was real to him . As real as what you experienced was to you , but that does n't mean he grew hair all over his body and walked around on all fours . My mother has been on my mind a lot lately . We just had a big anniversary . I could taste the blood in the air . I could feel the wind . I was seasick from the rocking of the boat . Hi . Hi . What are you reading ? The paq'batlh . It 's a sacred Klingon scroll . Find anything ? You do n't want to know . Oh , come on . It ca n't be that bad . You want to bet ? I found out why my mother is on her way to Gre'thor . It 's because I sent her there . What do you mean ? The sins of the child . She 's being punished for my dishonor . I turned my back on everything Klingon , and now she has to pay the price . B'Elanna , you ca n't even be sure your mother is dead , much less blame yourself for what happens to her in some afterlife . Look at this . The Eleventh Tome of Klavek . It 's a story about Kahless returning from the dead ... B'Elanna , this ... And the only reason Kahless was in the afterlife to begin with was to rescue his brother from the Barge of the Dead and deliver him to Sto - Vo - Kor . Okay . Do n't you see ? I have a chance to rescue my mother if I can accept responsibility for her dishonor before she passes through the gates of Gre'thor . I have to go back . Whoa . Wait a minute . What do you mean , " go back " ? I ca n't let her suffer for what I 've done . It 's the only way . B'Elanna , I respect what you believe in , but you 're starting to scare me . I 'm scaring myself . It 's a controlled procedure . I 'll be under constant supervision . The Doctor can simulate the conditions of the ion storm . He 's agreed to help me , but only with your permission . I 'm still not inclined to grant your request . But that 's what it is . There 's a limit to how far I 'll let religious practices go aboard this ship . If your belief system required you to sacrifice a child to your gods , I would n't allow that , either . That 's an absurd example . You want to simulate a near- death experience , so you can revisit the Barge of Death , and you 're telling me what 's absurd ? Bottom line , B'Elanna- - I 'm not going to let you risk your life for this . Captain , please . Request denied . What I do with my own life is one thing , but to know that I have condemned my mother ... that because of what I 've done , she 's ... I appreciate what you 're trying to say , B'Elanna , but whatever you experienced , it was n't real . It does n't matter if you think it was real . I need to confront what 's happened . I 'm sorry . You know , you 're just like her . Lieutenant ? My mother . You 're as dedicated to Starfleet principles as she was to Klingon honor . I know that we have n't always seen eye to eye , but despite our differences , you helped me become a good officer and I 'd like to think that you 're proud of me for it . I am . My mother never had the chance to be proud of me . I 'd like her to know me the way you do . I do n't want her to die thinking of me as a disgrace . You have to let me do this . I ca n't believe the Captain is allowing this . One minute , you 're in a coma . The next , you 're a born- again Klingon ? I- I just do n't get it . I 'm not sure I get it , either . Go to church , or something ? It would n't be enough . Look , I 'll read the scrolls . I 'll learn Klingon . We 'll figure this out ... together . Next time . I just hope there is a next time . There will be . Report . I 've examined the sensor logs from the shuttle mission . I should be able to re- create the exact conditions that triggered her near- death experience . Good . B'Elanna ? I 'm ready . Be careful . You 'll have an hour to do whatever it is you need to do . At the first sign of trouble , we 're bringing you out . Understood ? Computer ... erect an isolation field around the Surgical Bay . Decrease oxygen concentration within the force field by 27 percent . Begin ionizing the enclosed atmosphere to 5,000 particles per cubic meter . She 's unconscious . Neural activity is decreasing to 87 percent ... 62 percent ... Synaptic function is failing . Compensating . Neural activity is nominal . Qapla ' , B'Elanna . sus'ag Gre'thor qay . Mother . Stay away . You are an illusion . You 're a kos'kari trying to lure me away . Mother , it 's me . It 's me . B'Elanna ? No . Then you died as well ? I 've come to lift your dishonor . But you do n't believe in Sto - Vo - Kor . A lot 's happened since the last time I saw you . I 've changed . Not enough . It was you who brought this damnation upon me . If you had n't tried to , to force me to become a warrior ... I tried to guide you in the ways of a Klingon . You tried a little too hard . If you had listened to me when you were younger , we would n't be on the Barge of the Dead . You were always running away . You drove me away ... the same way you drove away my father ... including me . I wanted to give you honor . And if you had understood that , I would not be on my way to Gre'thor . We 're on the Barge of the Dead ... and we 're still having the same argument we were having ten years ago . Look , if I have dishonored you , I am truly sorry . Are you ? You have too much anger in your heart to be sorry . Oh , we do n't have time for this if we 're going to perform the transference . is that how you intend to lift my dishonor ? By taking my place ? Oh , do n't worry . I have no intention of being on this barge when it gets to Gre'thor . We 've got just enough time to perform the ritual before my crew resuscitates me . Oh . I should have known you 'd choose the easy way . There she is . Bring them . The mongrel child has returned . I 'm here to take my mother 's place . B'Elanna ! You wish to claim her dishonor as your own ? Yes . You 're willing to die for her ? Yes . Release her to Sto - Vo - Kor . No ! Keep her quiet ! Silence ! It 's not your decision . She has the right to reclaim your honor . Once we have reached Gre'thor and you are within its gates , I will release her . No . Now . You 're very impatient . Time must be slipping away in the living world . You 're concerned that your friends will revive you before you complete your deception . Did you really think I could be fooled so easily ? I will die for her . No tricks , no games . I will take her place honorably . Like a Klingon . No ! I forbid it ! I understand . Your dishonor has been lifted . Sto - Vo - Kor awaits you . I will not abandon my daughter . She has made the choice . Go ! Daughter of Miral , embrace your fate . Vih . Her neural patterns are breaking down . I 'm initiating emergency resuscitation . Vent the ionized particles . 20 milligrams cordrazine now ! I 'm deactivating the force field . Welcome to Gre'thor . This is n't Gre'thor . Oh , I assure you it is . You 've taken your mark . What is this , some kind of a joke ? This is no laughing matter . You 've met Mr . Neelix , our Ambassador to the recently deceased . Questions , comments , suggestions ... he 's your man . If you 'll follow me . By the way , I 'll be performing an aria from Berlioz 's Faust tomorrow night in Holodeck 2 . Feel free to stop by . 15 decks . Computers augmented with bio- neural circuitry . No Fek'lhr ? No Cavern of Despair ? Do n't need them . I do n't consider Voyager hell ! Are you sure ? Have you ever been truly happy here ? If you thought 50 years aboard this ship would be difficult , try eternity . Ej im- ta fey DE- ja i ejdahk- so - TAS ghos va Skral byteek Empa jaj law- mooch jaj- push ... This is a great day for B'Elanna Torres , a day when we pay tribute to her dishonor . She 's not responding to the cordrazine . Neural activity at 48 percent ... 37 . We 're losing her . We have to stabilize her synaptic functions . I 'm attempting a direct neural resequencing . B'Elanna 's misdeeds have led her to Gre'thor . She comes with no valor , no glory ... nothing to celebrate in song and story . You really have no one to blame but yourself . You 've kept us all at arm 's length , even Tom , who you claim to love . Here , here . She inherited that from her mother along with the forehead . What do you think of the afterlife so far ? It 's not exactly what I had in mind . Are you interpreting all the symbols ? Searching your subconscious for their meaning ? Lieutenant Torres ... defend yourself . Captain ? What are you still doing here ? I 've released you to Sto - Vo - Kor . You ca n't free me until you free yourself . I do n't understand . You never did . I did everything that the ritual told me to do . I came back for you ... Forget the ritual . It 's meaningless . Meaningless ? I died for you . No , you did n't . It 's not your time . You still do n't understand this journey . Then tell me . Request denied . What do you want ? Who are you asking ? You , Kahless , the tooth fairy ! Anybody who will tell me what I am supposed to do ! initiate cortical stimulation . Pulses at 50 millijoules . No effect . increase to 70 millijoules . Come on , B'Elanna . Defend yourself . You want me to fight ? You want me to be a good little Klingon ? is that it ? You 've let your anger consume you . Now it 's consuming us . She has condemned us all . Misery loves company . Get away from me ! Or what ? You 'll kill us where we stand ? Tell me what you want me to be ! A good Starfleet officer ? A good Maquis ? Lover ? Daughter ? Just tell me what you want from me ! We do n't want anything from you , B'Elanna . We only want you . We 're not your enemies . Defend yourself . I do n't know how . I am so tired of fighting . We know . You 've taken the first step of your journey . And what about you ? We will see each other again . Or maybe ... when you get home . Mother ? Oh , God , I 'm alive . Welcome back . 
@@5232241 All right , let 's go . I was supposed to be at the club half an hour ago . Hey , are you a good witch or a bad witch ? I am going to be a very good witch from now on . And you picked a role model who wears lots and lots of pink ? - Yes . - Glinda helped innocents , did n't she ? - Yes . - You had the answer all along ? That 's not help , that 's mind games . I 'm not gon na let you spoil my new attitude . I 'm going to celebrate the witch 's holiday with enthusiasm . The problem is , you never know what you 're celebrating - when you celebrate Halloween . - Details . Where 's Darryl ? He 's in the kitchen , on the phone . Hook-nosed hags riding broomsticks , that 's what we 're celebrating . Personally , I am offended by the representation of witches in popular culture . Right , which is why you 're dressed as the mistress of the dark . - Thanks . - Amazing . Let 's go . All right , inspector . Put down the phone and nobody gets hurt . Yeah , sweetie , I got ta go . Give your folks my love , okay ? I miss you guys . - Nice costume . - Yeah , it 's from my rookie days . - Still fits . - Yeah , mine too . Is n't that from World War II ? Who are you ? I 'll explain on the way . So in the meantime , we can just stick together , since we are both dateless . He 's not dateless , he 's married . You 're dateless because you 're picky . No . I 'm not settling , all right . The perfect guy is out there , a real man , and I will find him , trust me . And they 're gon na love the popcorn and caramel in your teeth too . All right , Darryl , let 's go . Cole Turner ? The ADA ? You 're dating him ? No , I just sort of invited him to go along with us . It was n't set in stone or anything , but something must 've come up . Hey . Hey , cool costumes , dudes . What the hell are you doing ? Belthazor ? I use the name Cole here . Let him go . We do n't need him . Not to get the Charmed Ones . My next question , did n't they already get you two years ago ? - Yeah , but it 's Halloween . When the veil between worlds thin when the demons who know how can return to seek their revenge . I know . Which is why I have a different plan for the witches . One that does n't include you . One that 's been approved by the Triad . We do n't answer to anyone anymore . We 're dead . There 's dead and there 's dead . Fine . I want a picture of all of us first , but I have to get my broomstick . clich��� ? . Come on , you guys , hurry up . Trick or treat . Oh , my God , that is so weird , they look just like the Grim ... - " Uh-oh " what ? - Piper . Prue . Phoebe . Did n't we vanquish them already ? That 's not what I wanted to warn you about . What do you mean ? That 's what I wanted to warn you about . Look out ! Leo , what the hell is ... ? Wait ! They do n't know what 's happening ! This is n't good , right ? - Is everybody okay ? - Too soon to tell . Did the Grimlocks do this ? Unless we 're dead and this is the hereafter , I do n't think so . Eternally Elvira . All right . - So this sort of looks like an altar . - A witch 's altar . - Not good , not good , not good . We 're not in Kansas anymore . Come along ! Over there ! Come with me this way . Do n't tell me we 've time-travelled again . I hate time-travelling . You do ? I was burned at the stake last time , remember ? All right , let 's make sure that does n't happen again . From what they 're wearing , it looks to be , what , 16 , 1700s ? Where the life expectancy of the average witch is , what , 15 minutes . Find anything , Micah ? No , nothing here . - Ride on . - Ride on , men ! Hey , why did n't you let me freeze him ? I do n't know , there was just something ... Okay , you know what ? I do n't care why we 're here or how we got here , I just wan na get home . Actually , except for that blond with the funky snake tongue thingy . - What are they ? - I do n't know . How do you know they did n't make the girls disappear ? Because this is different . This is a time portal that my bosses sent them through . Which is closed now , damn it . - Who are you ? - I 'm their ... Never mind . It 's too complicated . I got ta get you out of here before they unfreeze . - Hold it , I 'm not going anywhere . - I 've got ta figure out a way to get rid of these demons before the girls return , otherwise they 'll be sitting ducks . - Are you sure they 're coming back ? - They better be . They got ta do it before Halloween ends too , which means ... Which means you 're gon na need my help . You do n't know what you 're up against here . They 're like sisters to me , Leo . All right . Phoebe said that she thought they had vanquished these demons before , so the first thing we have to do is ... Run . Come on , let 's go ! At least we ca n't die . They can . We have to figure out where the witches went . We know where they went . Cole got them . But if he fails , they 'll be back . And they 'll be in our way . Blessed be . Our prayers have been answered . - We need your help . - Excuse me ? Forgive me for the manner in which you were brought here , but we had to make sure you were who we 'd sent for . This doorway would have told us if you were evil . - Where can we get one of those ? - All right , wait . Who do you think we are ? The most powerful good witches of all time , of course . A midwife , a witch , and a free citizen of the colony of Virginia . These good women are my coven . Come . Now , we do n't have much time . No one can suspect that you 've come to us from the future . - This is for you . - Witches must not have to hide in your time . - What year are you from ? - 2000 . - What year is it now ? - 1670 . All right , so why do you need our help ? To save a magical baby who 's prophesied to be born tonight . - Save it from who ? - A dark practitioner . She kidnapped the baby 's mother in hopes of raising the child evil . If that happens , good magic will never flourish in the New World . You must rescue Charlotte so that you can bring her here and we can deliver her baby within our own protective circle . All Hallows Eve ? A witch 's most sacred day . The day when the source of all magic can be tapped into . How can you not know about All Hallows Eve ? It is n't what it used to be . Wait a minute . You can tap into that power to send us home , right ? We assumed you could . They assumed that we could . Okay , well , Piper , I have an idea . So , what time is it ? It 's 2:15 . You 've made a big clock so small , you must possess great magic . Just a good credit card . Okay , excuse us for a minute . Can we talk ? All right , I think that I have this figured out . I think that they sent us here , and that 's what Leo was trying to tell us . - All right , Eva , do you have a plan ? - Yes . This vial holds a potion which will put the men who guard the house to sleep . Then you 'll use your powers to bring the mother back here . Easy for her to say . We must be careful . Looks like they 're having a party . It 's the kidnapper , Ruth Cobb . She 's doing it pretending to mock All Hallows Eve , but I know better . She 's really doing it to tap into the powers of dark magic . - Looks like our welcoming committee . - Witch hunters . Hunters of good witches , maybe . They work for Ruth . They 're after us . Not all of them . Beware the talismans . They 've barred our way each time we tried to rescue Charlotte . - No , you do n't realize ... Witches ! There they are ! What the hell was that ? - The talismans ? - No way they have that much power . They never have before . Ruth 's using the magic of All Hallows Eve . - Guards ! - All right , I got them . I got them . What just happened ? What 's the matter ? I do n't know . Piper ! - Use your powers . - We do n't have any . - What ? - Run ! Oh , God . It appears your witch friend has brought others to try and rescue you again . Unfortunately , she 's been wounded . Oh , easy now , Charlotte . We would n't want anything bad to happen to your baby , now would we ? I wo n't let you have my baby . Oh , you wo n't have a choice . Especially since somebody very special has recently arrived to ensure it . - How much longer , Ruth ? - Soon . To change it . Eva , we 're sorry . We did n't know that our powers were n't ... Just leave us . Just go back to wherever it is you came from . We asked for the most powerful witches of all time , and instead we get powerless frauds . Okay , I know you 're a little disappointed , but " frauds " is a little harsh , do n't you think ? We do have powers , we just ... Or at least , we had them , we just ca n't access them right now . Maybe that 's because technically we do n't really exist yet , so neither do our powers . Protecting this baby is my destiny . How can we come this far just to fail ? We 're asking ourselves the same thing . Bite down . What are you doing ? - Cauterising her wound . Just get some hot water and some soap and some clean cloths . Hurry . Eva , do n't give up on us yet , all right . I know that we can help . Yeah , we 've been through tougher jams than this before . - We have ? - Have n't we ? We were born witches . That makes us innately magical . Maybe you can just teach us how to tap into it . - There 's not enough time . - We 're quick studies . That thing 's not gon na work on them . Maybe not , but it makes them think twice about it . Otherwise they would 've blasted in on us by now . - Plus , it 's the only thing we got . - Maybe not . I think I found out who they are . " Grimlocks : underground demons who are sensitive to light and steal children 's sight so they can see the aura that surrounds good people and strangle them with it . We ca n't keep waiting here . We should be downstairs , waiting for the witches . We ca n't absorb any more wounds . If they come into range , we wo n't have to . Darryl . I told you you did n't know what you were up against . Who are you ? Come on , we got a potion to cook up . Your contractions are coming closer together . It wo n't be long now . Do n't touch me . There 's no need for you to be any more uncomfortable than you have to be . Really ? Then let me go . I beg you . Even if I could , it would n't help . Another would be sent to take you right back . What ? What do you see ? A force of great good . From your time . Here for the baby as well . Three of them . I 'm not surprised . My travelling here undoubtedly alerted the other side . - But this new force ... You just make sure she stays here through midnight . Here . Dolls ? We tap into our powers with dolls ? It 's not just a doll , it 's a totem . It reminds us of the wisdom and the power of women . Okay , but what does it have to do with ? The witch 's journey is a walk of wisdom collected over the years , Phoebe . Wisdom gives us power . Power frightens the fearful and ignorant . Well , that would certainly explain why in our time , witches are made to look silly on Halloween . And this magic , this knowledge , is forgotten ? We could get it back if you teach us . Here . The conical hat is a spiritual point . It helps to channel our magic . Keeps us centred , focused . The apple holds a pentacle in its heart . Add a laurel leaf , you will block the path of evil . - A simple laurel leaf ? - Simple , but powerful . So a mask allows you to hide your identity , walk amongst them . Can I see that ? Okay , now , do n't tell me you ride around on this thing . Anything 's possible . Here . The broom 's traditional purpose is to sweep evil from your path . Sweep east to west , same path as the sun travels . Like anything else in magic , it 's how you do it . With knowledge and reverence . Wow , do I feel silly . - What happened ? - Nothing . - Must 've been just a spark . - No . You felt the power . All right , Sally will go with you to Ruth 's house . She 'll give you the last few things you 'll need . I wish I could go with you . We 'll do great . You 've armed us well . Remember , connect with the power of this day . The house is guarded by men and magic . Charlotte 's not going anywhere . I 've seen the future , Ruth . Your ignorance is your destiny . Charlotte should be in the bedroom at the top of the stairs . Be careful . Ruth 's guards are everywhere . If they see you with these tools , they 'll know you as witches . - Do n't worry , we wo n't fail this time . - I know you wo n't . Which of you - will be standing guard for the others ? - Phoebe . If need be , this will turn away evil spirits . Perhaps even the demon you think Ruth summoned . You 're kidding , right ? - Okay , you 're not kidding . - Blessed be . Good luck . All right . - Trick or treat . - Oh , boy . Care to know your future , milady ? Oh , no , thanks , I 'm pretty familiar with it already . - Prove it . And why would you be interested , sir ? And why would n't you be ? Okay . How do I do it ? First , you must fill your heart with only thoughts of love . And close your eyes and blow on the peel . Drop the peel into the water . - And watch . - And how is it that apple - knows this big secret ? - It 's simple , milady . Apples are the fruit of knowledge . It is C . The name of your true love begins with a C . Cole . Witch ! No . Phoebe ! - Those two as well ! - Hey ! - There 's your three . - Hang the witches . - Hang them . - Hang them ! - Hang them all ! - My pleasure . - Take them from here . - Hang them ! Take them away . To the woods . Hang them . Take them away . Come along . Onward . Ride on . My apologies . A little trick I learned from the French . Run the noose line to the waist . Yeah , well , it 's a really good thing the other guards did n't see you do that . Wait a minute . I do n't understand . How did you know you could trust him ? By the look in his eyes . So that would be the second time that you 've saved our necks . And what beautiful necks they are . I 'm Micah . I 'm charmed . All right , I hate to bust up the balcony scene , Romeo , but why do you keep saving us ? And why are you running with the witch hunters ? So I can undo their work whenever possible . I 've seen what dark magic can do . If you 're fighting that , I 'm on your side . And I should get back before anyone gets suspicious . Thank you . Another time . We need to get out of here . Pay attention . Okay , any idea how we 're gon na save the baby ? Well , they think we 're dead now . They certainly are n't expecting us . Right . Besides , you guys we 're witches , and it 's All Hallows Eve , so ... - All right , glow elsewhere . - Oh , right . We need more thyme . I ca n't help you there , buddy . It 's almost nightfall . No , I 'm talking about an herb , it 's for the potion . It 's over there . - Thyme , right ? - Yeah . Do you think they know what we 're doing in here ? Probably . It 'd explain why they have n't burst in on us yet . - Trick-or-treaters ? - Or a trap . Did n't you say those things steal kids ' sight ? No , I should go . I can orb . Which might be exactly what they 're waiting for . - Trick or treat . - Spread the word . We 're out of candy . I do n't see Ruth or the guards . What time is it ? It 's ... It 's 6 . And we 're running out of time and magic . - It does n't change what we have to do . - How will we get past the talismans ? - Do you remember what Eva said ? - The " powerless frauds " part ? No , the " magic is all around us " part . Well , it 's time we learned how to access that to sweep away evil . What , no funny hat ? Lavender . Did n't she say that was a protection herb ? Yes , and the wisdom of the women before us will guide us again . Okay , get sweeping . Okay , which way is east ? That way . - Did you see that ? - Yeah , keep going . - Prue , you ca n't . Wrong . - They found him out . - We have to get to Charlotte . What would he want you to do ? - Hi . - Who are you ? Eva sent us . Charlotte , we 're here to take you back . You 're lying . I do n't believe ... Okay , okay . How does Lamaze breathing go ? Oh , that 's it . Oh , God . Okay , try this . Okay , we 'll do this . How are you making the pain go away ? Good magic . Just keep breathing . - Good magic ? - Acupressure . Good idea . All right . We need to get you out of here . Come on , honey . It 's okay . - Oh , her water just broke . - I see that . It serves you well . - Quickly , check the house ! - No . I know these witches . They 've already got Charlotte . Follow me . - I ca n't . I 'm sorry . - Yes , Charlotte . - You can do this . - No . - Charlotte . - The baby 's coming now . Oh , God . Okay . Easy , easy . It 's almost 11 . Do you think they gave up on us ? - No , I do n't think so . - All right , what do we have ? We got big problems , a little time and a little magic . Did n't Eva say something about Charlotte giving birth - in a protective circle ? - Can we make one of those ? I do n't know , we 've got lavender and ... Is n't rosemary supposed to be good for protection ? Apples and laurel leaves block the path of evil . Put it all together , it may just work . - Who 's gon na deliver the baby ? - Personally , I think you should , considering we know you 're gon na have one in the future . - I always get the messy jobs . All right , if ever there was a time that we were going to connect , it needs to be now . So , Phoebe , form a circle , I 'll work on the apples . Over here . Okay , you 're gon na have to try and be kind of quiet . Okay , I know , I 'm sorry . Okay . Do n't worry . Everything 's under control . Oh , my God . I see it . I see it . - Really ? - Phoebe , the circle . - The circle . - Okay . Just ... Just try not to push , okay . - This baby is coming . - Yeah , well , so are they . Okay , we can do this . - Yes , we can do this . - We have to do this . All right , here . Knowledge and reverence . All right . Put it all together , it 's gon na work . Come on . They 've connected . - It 's over . - No , not yet . How cool is that ? It actually worked . - Or not . - It does n't stop bullets . We are running out of ammo . Prue , it 's not like an apple is gon na stop them anyway . It 's a girl . Piper , get Charlotte and the baby out of here . Okay , I think I have an idea of what might really scare them . What are you gon na do ? I 'm going to embrace the clich��� ? . There is something you do n't see every day . - A flying witch ! - Their power is great ! Got ta give them credit . They 're awfully good . It 's all right . Time 's on my side . Blessed be . - Is n't the future beautiful ? - It is , thanks to you . You found the power . You only have yourself to blame , right , Pheebs ? I know it and I love it . Now if I could just figure out how to take it back with me . Hey , what are they waiting for ? Why have n't they sent us home yet ? Maybe we have n't learned everything that we 're supposed to yet . Well , it 's almost midnight , so if we 're gon na learn anything more , we better hurry . I promise my daughter will know of you . Of the three powerful witches who came to bring her into this world . And we 'll always be grateful . Wo n't we , Melinda ? Melinda ? Yes , Melinda . Melinda Warren . What is it ? I ... I think we 're related . I told you they 'd come . Hey . - Darryl ? - Prue ? I got it . Okay , open your eyes . Happy Halloween . Use that broom with reverence . Hey , Halloween is now officially my favourite holiday . - Who knew ? - We did n't . But we should have . So much knowledge , so much power that we lost . But we 'll get it back . Okay , well , one crash course at a time . Yeah . It 's too bad Darryl did n't feel up to celebrating with us . He saw a lot today . I think he needs some time to sort it all out . Yeah , well , so do we . I mean , it 's bad enough that the Triad wants us dead , but to send someone back to wipe out our whole line ? Do your bosses have any clue who it is ? None that they 're sharing . I think it was that guy who was hitting on Phoebe at the party . Hang on . And that 's all that matters . And I helped to deliver our great , great , great-whatever . Great-grandmother . Too bad we could n't save her from moving from Virginia to Salem . That would 've been nice . Yeah , well , you ca n't change history , for better or worse . Excuse me . - Hi . - Micah ? Mitch , actually . Forgive my directness , but I 've been watching you from across the room . Have we met ? You know , that 's funny , I was gon na ask you the same thing . My turn . - Hey . - Hey . I was beginning to think I got stood up . Yeah , sorry . Work , you know . I guess I just lost track of time . That 's okay . I got kind of hung up myself . So you 're an angel . This ? No , not really . That 's okay . Neither am I . 
@@5232341 - lt sure is cold here . - I know . If we 're lucky , maybe we 'll have a white Christmas . That 'd be kind of neat . - Hey , it was fun travelling with you . - You too . And thanks for listening to me . What else was I gon na do for 1 6 hours ? Thanks a lot . Good luck , Steve . And I hope that , you know , you find her . Well , everybody 's got a real mom out there somewhere , right ? Harry , go get the car . There 's our baby . Hey , I got ta go . That 's my mom . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . - How are you ? - Great . So over here is our entire skin care line . Now , the kits come pre-wrapped . The customers like it that way . Oh , and you remember what I told you about filling out the invoices ? I think so . Always add everything up on the calculator first , - just to make sure the figures match . Time to party . Diedre ? Thanks for the opportunity . What the hell , it 's Christmas . Good morning , ladies . Brenda . Hi , guys . What are you doing here ? What do you mean ? I love this place . Besides , you 're the first one of my friends who 's had a real job . So is there anything that I can help you with today ? Oh , please , listen to you . Come on , this is serious . Okay . Pretend like you 're showing us this jewellery so we can keep talking . All right , I really think you should take a look at these . Oh , very nice . You know , I 'm really starting to get worried about Steve . - Yeah , he 's been gone four days . - Nobody 's talked to him . His mom keeps calling my house . She 's totally freaked out . Maybe we should n't have let him go . I do . I mean , especially around Christmas , you know ? He 'd always buy me something really nice , even though we were n't going out . What if he never comes back ? Look , guys , why do n't you come over tonight ? Brandon and my dad are out buying a Christmas tree and we 'll all get together and do sort of a tree-trimming thing . You guys have n't bought your tree yet ? There are only two days till Christmas . - We 've had ours for a week . - lt 's a family tradition . We always wait two days before Christmas . That way , you get the freshest tree . I mean , it 's a family tradition . We always wait until two days before Christmas . That way , we always get the freshest tree . Dad , these trees do n't look too healthy . You should have been here a week ago . We had lots of healthy trees . Look at this , the needles are brown . The sun just wilts them . Come on . We 'll go somewhere else . You 're not gon na do better than here . It 's the same all over . - We 'll see . Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Do n't worry , we 'll get a great tree , you 'll see . It 's 90 degrees here . Yes , that 's right , you heard me , nine-oh . I mean , I 'm sitting here in my shorts . It is ? It 's really snowing ? You 're gon na have a white Christmas . Oh , that 's what I miss the most . Mom , I got ta go . That 's Jim and Brandon with the tree . Well , yes , of course , we still have Christmas trees here . I 'll call you later . Listen , give my love to Dad . Bye-bye . - Come on , Brandon , lift ! Easy , easy . Jim , what happened to the tree ? I mean , it 's - - I think the word you 're looking for is " dead , " Mom . It 's not really dead , it 's just kind of wilted . What do you mean , wilted ? I mean , could n't you find a green tree ? Well , not in this heat . And not when you go to buy it two days before Christmas . Come on , it 's not really that bad . Yes , it is , Jim . I 'm sorry , but yes , it is that bad . Well , what do you want me to do about it ? We should have gone back to my mother 's . Cindy , we did that last year . All of us crammed into your parents ' house . The trees are green and there 's snow on the ground . Honey , we live here now . We ca n't keep running back to Minneapolis every Christmas . It 'll be a fine Christmas , you 'll see . We 've got to do something about this tree . Brandon , what are you doing ? Brenda , you were n't supposed to see this . Why are you spray-painting our Christmas tree ? - Well ... - Oh , that 's looking much better . Yeah , hang a little tinsel on it , you wo n't be able to tell the difference . Well , Christmas in Beverly Hills . I mean , it 's not natural . I do n't know , it seemed pretty natural to the hordes of shoppers that were in the store today . Oh , how was the job ? Exhausting . But I made some good sales . I might be able to actually buy you guys something nice this year . Oh , well , honey , it 's the thought that counts . You tell her , Mom . Well , frankly , I 'm having a hard time thinking about Christmas at all . It feels like the middle of August . Next year , we 'll get a fake one . Was that Cindy Walsh or Ebenezer Scrooge ? Well , Mom 's just having a little trouble adjusting to Christmas here in sunny Southern California . You got ta admit , it does take some getting used to . So , what do you think ? It 's the thought that counts . - You guys are so Christmassy . - What do you mean ? The lights on the house , the big tree , all these old-fashioned ornaments that have probably been in your family for generations . Kelly , they were giving these away last year at Jack in the Box . is there something wrong with this tree ? No . Why do you say that ? I do n't know . It 's , like , kind of a funky colour . Still suffering a little geographic dislocation ? I guess so . - We 'll get used to it . - Thought we had . Listen , why do n't we have a Minneapolis Christmas right here ? We can invite all the kids ' friends over for Christmas Eve , - start a new tradition . - We could do that . Yeah , I bet a few of those kids out there would love to be part of a real family Christmas . Oh , my God , I do n't believe it ! Oh , how cute . Those are from when we were little guys . I have n't seen those in years . " And the stockings were hung by the chimney with care , in hopes that St . Nick would soon be there . " Kelly , please , put those away . Cold apple cider . I 'll go for that . Thanks , Mom . Well , you guys just could n't wait to get up those stockings , huh ? Busted . You know , back in Minneapolis , we always had these huge Christmas Eve dinners . We 'd invite our whole family and friends and we 'd exchange gifts and sing carols . And they always ended up in this huge snowball fight out in the backyard . Well , anyway , we 're gon na skip the snowball fight this year , but in honour of our first Beverly Hills Christmas , I want to invite everyone to spend Christmas Eve here , with your families , and so we can begin a new tradition . Hey , come on , it 'll be fun . Well , I 'd love to Mrs . Walsh , but we 're all going skiing in Mammoth over Christmas . Oh , well , that 's terrific . What about you , Kelly ? Well , for the first time since I can ever remember , my mom is going to make Christmas dinner at our house . We 're having it with David Silver and his dad . Oh , it 's wonderful . What about you , Dylan ? I assume you 're gon na spend Christmas with us . Actually , I 'm gon na go and visit my dad . You are ? I thought you were having dinner with us ? Well , yeah , Bren , but I mean , my dad 's alone in jail and it is Christmas Eve . Of course , Dylan . I mean , of course , you have to be with him . Thank you , though , for the invite . Hey , wait a second . What about Steve ? I knew somebody was missing . You guys , Steve went to find his mother . - What ? - I thought his mother lived here . No . Supposedly , she lives somewhere in New Mexico . His real mother , that is . Steve 's adopted . I did n't know that . Yeah , she told him to go for it , if it 's what he had to do . Well , I guess that 's just something Steve will have to deal with . That is , of course , assuming he can find her . Brandon , I mean , does he even know her name ? All I know is that my mother 's name was Karen Brown and I was born May 1 5th , 1 7 years ago . Are you sure it was this hospital ? No , but it was this town . Then it was probably here . Can I see some identification , please ? Yeah , sure . I do n't know how I 've gotten along this far without having a copy of my birth certificate . I 'll be right back . Dr . Rosen , Dr . Rosen , please call your office . is that it ? - lt appears so . - Can I have it ? I did n't realise you were under 1 8 . - You ca n't be serious . - I 'm afraid so . Look , Sister . I 've travelled a long way to be here , by bus , okay ? So why do n't we make one little exception to the rule . - And it 'll be our little secret , okay ? - I 'm sorry . Come back after your parent has signed this form . If I knew who my real parent was , I would n't be here . Okay , suppose I made a little donation to your favourite charity . Yeah . I should 've known you guys are n't the types to go for bribes . Dr . Morgan , please report to Emergency . You can look at it . Dr . Patrick , report to Reception Area 2 . But I ca n't let it leave this counter . Thank you , Sister . Believe me , he 'd be pleased . " Steven Brown . Born the 1 5th of May in Albuquerque , New Mexico to Karen Brown . " This is it . Mother 's mailing address . You do n't mind if I write this down , do you ? 5595 Navajo Trail . Merry Christmas , Sister . I wo n't forget you for this . Merry Christmas . Order 's up , Brandon ! Come on , Nat , give me a break . Where 's your Christmas spirit , huh ? It always goes south around cold burgers . - Come on , move , move . - Yeah . Well , sir , what can I get for you ? How about a nice cup of java , on the house ? On the house . That 'd be nice . I 'm kind of busted . Okay , sure . I 'm kind of hungry too . Let me see what I can do . Hey , Nat , do you think we can rustle something up for the old guy over there ? I think he 's homeless and , you know , tomorrow 's Christmas . - Jeez , it 's already starting . But it looks like they 're starting to flood in early . Why did n't you tell me ? You spend Christmas with your family . No , no way , forget it , I 'll be here . What time ? Noon . But you do n't have to . Nat , what am I gon na do , abandon you on Christmas ? - I 'll be here , all right ? - Okay . So , what do I tell him ? Get him the special . But that 's it , no substitutions . - Okay , Nat . - I got something to show you . - Here you go , sir . - Oh , thanks . - I got some food coming for you too . - Oh , it 'll be nice . I wear it every year . That 's great . I bet you make a great Santa Claus . What 's that supposed to mean ? Saved by the bell . Order 's up . Come on , enough of this Christmas cheer . This is it . Wait a minute , this ca n't be it . 5595 Navajo Trail . But I 'm looking for a house . Oh , there used to be some houses there . But that was a long time ago . Could you just take me back to my hotel ? - Do n't you go to Beverly High School ? - No , I go to West Beverly . - Hey , chief . - Hey , Brandon . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . - So , what can I do you for ? - Maybe a slice of that peach pie . Sounds like trouble . The only time you come in here and eat pie is when you 're depressed . What 's the matter , Andrea , you miss school already ? Do n't worry , we 'll be back at school in a week and the paper will still be there . - That 's not it , Brandon . - Well , then what is it ? Oh , it 's all this Christmas stuff . We do n't celebrate Hanukkah , either . My parents think it 's easier that way . You know , just kind of ignore both , as if that is remotely possible . Do n't feel left out . Why do n't you come over to my house ? My mom makes a killer Christmas dinner . She 's dying for company . I ca n't . I promised my grandma I 'd go to the movies with her . She loves going on Christmas Eve . There are never any lines . - So bring her with you . - I do n't know . Christmas is n't exactly her kind of thing . You know what I mean ? Excuse me . Brandon , have you seen my Santa outfit ? Well , yeah , you were just showing it to me over here a second ago . I know . I brought it out , an order came up and I put it down . Now it 's gone . Nat , be real . Merry Christmas . Take one home to the little one . Merry Christmas . Okay , there you go . - How 's that ? - Perfect . Thank you . You 're welcome . Merry Christmas to you . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Here , Brenda , take care of this . I got ta kick this nut out of here . - Be nice . - Nice ? After all , he is Santa Claus . Merry Christmas . I should send some of these designs home to my elves . Very funny . Would you mind leaving , please ? Are n't you in need of some Christmas cheer ? All I 'm in need of is a security guard to keep nutcases like you out of here . Now , goodbye . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . - Hello . - Hello . I 'm looking for Karen Brown , - or a relative of Karen Brown . Hello ? Jerk . - Hello . - Hi , I 'm looking for Karen Brown , - or a relative of Karen Brown's . - Who ? Yeah , she gave birth to a son about 1 7 years ago , a baby boy . Karen Brown or a relative of Karen Brown 's . She gave birth to a son about 1 7 years ago . - I do n't know about around here . - No , I did n't think you would . Well , you have yourself a merry Christmas . Merry Christmas to you too . - Here you go . - Oh , great , thank you . Dylan . I thought you had left . What , are you kidding ? Without saying goodbye ? Hey , is it totally unprofessional to kiss you at work ? - Yes , it is . - Who cares ? It 's Christmas . And where did you get this ? Some crazy old Santa Claus outside was handing them out . - They 're probably poisoned . People are shoving each other on the sidewalk . They 're fighting for parking spaces to go spend money that they do n't even have . For what ? Everybody 's forgotten what it 's all about , if they even knew to begin with . Well , I have n't . No , I bet that you have n't . So merry Christmas , Bren . Should I open it now ? - Yeah , whenever . - Now . Dylan , it 's beautiful . Where 's the other half ? It 's right here , with me . Dylan , I love it . And I love you . I know . I love you too , Bren . I wish you did n't have to go . Yeah , well , I know we 've had our differences and they have been major , but I just ca n't stand the thought of my dad spending Christmas Eve alone in a jail . I could go with you . No ... Excuse me , miss ? is this gon na go on sale the day after Christmas ? Well , I do n't really know . Merry Christmas , Bren . You know , last year , I bought this gorgeous but outrageously expensive leather jacket here two days before Christmas . I come back a few days later only to notice that you have slashed all the prices 40 percent . Now , I do n't think that 's fair , do you ? I would like to buy the blouse now . If I buy it now , I should get the sale price , because after Christmas , it 's gon na be on sale . Hello , I 'm looking for Karen Brown or a relative of Karen Brown . She gave birth to a baby boy 1 7 years ago . Who is this ? What do you want ? Someone who needs to talk to her . This is very important . They 're going to get stiff . - When ? - Patience . Please . Who died and made you Julia Child ? You have n't touched a spatula in ten years . - Oh , my God ! - What ? Damn . There goes the cream of carrot soup . You know , Kel , it makes me a little nervous to say this , but the way things are going with Mel , I may even start cooking more often . Good , I think you need the practise . But seriously , I think it 's important that you realise how , well , important Mel is becoming to me . And vice versa , I hope . I think , after six months , I 'm beginning to get the idea , Mom . You know , it 's really the first totally healthy relationship I can ever remember . And on top of everything else , there is still that passion . About life , I mean . Well , I 'm happy if you 're happy . Thank you , sweetie . How weird . Keep beating . Coming . - Merry Christmas . - Mel ! How sweet . I 'm not expecting you for another few hours . I know , I know . I just came early to drop those off . They 're gorgeous . Come on , I want to put them in some water . - Jackie , wait . - What is it ? I ca n't ... I mean , David and I ca n't come tonight . What ? Why ? Well , it 's hard to explain . No , it 's not really . Sheila , David 's mom -- - Your wife . - My soon-to-be ex-wife . Anyway , it 's the first Christmas we 've been apart . She does n't want David to come here . She wants him home . Well , that 's understandable . But what about you ? She wants me home too . Just for Christmas , because she 's depressed . Well , I can understand how she feels . Pretty terrible , really . Frankly , Mel , I 'm finding it a little hard right now to sympathise with Sheila . - I 'm not asking you to . - Good . Because not only have I been knocking myself out here , trying to figure out how to make a Christmas dinner for all of us to enjoy together , but it also appears I 've been making a fool of myself for the last six months . Jackie , that 's not true . Now , we 're talking about one night . Yeah , sure , one night that just happens to be Christmas Eve . Mel , I took you seriously . I let down walls that have been up longer than I can remember . I talked to my daughter about us . I made up silly plans for us . - Oh , forget it . Here . - No . You want me to stare at these and think about you ? - Jackie , you 're overreacting . - I do n't think so . Merry Christmas . - Excuse me ? - Yeah . is this your place ? Well , yes , it is . I 'm the guy who called a little while ago . Oh , yeah ? Well , I do n't wan na talk to you . Please , I need your help . I need to find Karen Brown . Just what are you after , kid ? - Do you know her or not ? - Yes , I know her ! I 'm her father ! I 'm her son . Well , then ... Why do n't we go sit down ? Hi , Brenda . - Kelly , what 's wrong ? - Everything is a mess . You know that big dinner my mom and I were making for David and his dad ? Your mom forgot to defrost the turkey . No . You 're not gon na believe this , but David 's dad came over and told my mom that he wants to spend Christmas with his wife . Oh , your poor mom . She does n't even want to talk to him now . Maybe if I buy her another present , she 'll feel better . You think ? - Can I use your discount ? - Sure . But do you really think that 's gon na help ? I just - - I hate the thought of us spending Christmas Eve alone . I 'm afraid she 'll get all depressed and start drinking or something . Why do n't you two come over ? Are you sure ? I mean , it 's such short notice . - Who cares ? We 'd love to have you . - Thanks . Hey , what are friends for at Christmastime ? See you later . - Be there at 7 . - Okay , we 'll bring dessert . My mom made this incredible chocolate mousse . You will not believe it . Hi , merry Christmas . - Been a good girl this year ? - Unfortunately . - Have you ? - Definitely . Ca n't fool Santa . The young ladies are in need of some Christmas cheer . Oh , well , I 'm sure you know just how to give it to them . Listen , why do n't you take your big white beard and your little red suit right across the street and cheer up the security guards over at Tiffany 's ? Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . - Creep . Hi , I 'm here to see Emily Valentine . - And your name ? - Brandon Walsh . Sign here and I 'll see if she 's in her room . Thanks . - Brandon ! - Hi , Em . What are you doing here ? I look a mess . No , you do n't . You look great . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . Well , if you had any ideas I was crazy , I guess they 're confirmed now , huh ? - I tried calling , you know . - I know . My doctor thought it was best I stay out of touch for a while . Look , I just want to say I 'm sorry for all that stuff -- Emily , I did n't come here for that . This place has been really good for me . Some people have a lot of stuff in their heads they spend their whole lives not dealing with . I 'm gon na know myself really well by the time I leave this place . - When 's that gon na be ? - Soon . I may actually even go home tomorrow for Christmas dinner . It 's going back to school that 's gon na be the real challenge . Maybe Andrea can write an article , " Nutcase Returns to West Beverly . " No , I do n't think so . Open it . Come on . Oh , my God ! Your favourite shirt . Finally , it 's mine . Well , I figured if you wanted it that badly ... - You 're not getting it back , you know . - Read the card . " They all would have been here , except you have this ridiculously restrictive visitors policy . Thank you , Brandon . Hey , merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . I 'll get it . What are you doing here ? Since I 'm not gon na see you tonight , I just wanted to give you your gift . And what makes you so sure I 'd want a present from you ? It 's not my fault , Kelly . Do n't you think this is as bad for me as it is for you ? - What do you mean ? - Being caught in the middle like this . My mom using me as an excuse to get my dad over for Christmas ? And how do you think we feel , David , being dumped on Christmas Eve ? Look , I 'm sorry . I like your mom and I really wanted to spend Christmas with you guys . I thought you wanted your parents to get back together . Well , I do . I 'm not my dad , you know . I know . Still friends ? I guess . Wait a second , I have something for you . Do n't open that in front of your mom . - Why ? - lt vibrates . - David - - ! - I 'm just kidding ! It 's a joke . I swear , I 'm just kidding . - My name 's Al . - I 'm Steve . I know your name . I helped name you . - You did ? - I did . So does Karen , my mom , does she live around here ? Not anymore . - ls she married ? - She was . You think she 'd be happy to meet me ? I think she 'd be , yes . Why did she give me up ? Well , your mother was very young when you were born , Steve . Still in high school , did n't have a husband . I tended to agree with her . - So , what 'd she do after high school ? - She went to college in Albuquerque . Met a nice young man , got married . That 's why I could n't find her name in the book . She 's changed it . That 's it . To Mulligan . Does she ever talk about me , think about me ? I 'm sure , in her private moments , she did . But not around her family . Could I have her number , Al ? I do n't know why , but I 've got this strong feeling that I should be with her at Christmas . I 've got ta meet her . I 've got ta know who my real mother is . Well , that 's gon na be kind of tough . You see , in the first place , when she gave you up , she made it pretty final . That 's why she picked a good home . But if I could talk to her , Al , like I 'm talking to you here now ... I 'm sure she could handle it . I 'm her son . She died , Steve . - Karen 's dead . - What ? A real bad auto accident , not too far from here . Oh , my God . I 'm sorry . I 'm sure she would have liked to have seen you . But she 's gone . - Hey , Dad . - Hey , Brandon . All right , the surprise is all in place . I 'm worried that it 's gon na make mom more homesick than anything . Oh , do n't worry about your mother . She 's gon na be fine . Especially after she sees what I got her for Christmas . I 'll get it ! I hope you guys like turkey . There 's gon na be leftovers for months . Hi , I 'm Samantha Sanders . - Oh , merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . I 'm sorry , but you look just like you do on TV . Oh , God , I hope not . Oh , no . I mean , you look wonderful . Thank you . I 'm sorry to disturb you . I wondered if you had heard anything from Steve ? No , I have n't . Brandon , have you heard anything from Steve ? No . I have n't heard a word for four days . Finally , today , I just could n't stand it anymore . I called the police . They 're gon na file a missing persons report in a few hours . I suppose he told you where he was going . Yeah , he did . I never should have let him go . But he was so adamant , so insistent on finding his real mother , that I thought standing in his way would only make things worse . What an idiot . I 'm sure he 'll call tonight , or tomorrow at the latest . I ca n't believe it , either . Nobody celebrates Christmas like I do . When Steve was little , he used to have so many presents to open that by the time he got through them all , he was too exhausted to play with anything . Maybe that 's it . Maybe I gave him too many presents . Because whatever I did , it just backfired . That 's not true . I know Steve . He 's a wonderful boy . He 's funny and warm . - You had everything to do with that . - Maybe . Look , I do n't want to burden you with this on Christmas Eve . You 'll let me know if he calls , wo n't you ? - I 'll just be at home . - No , you wo n't . You 're staying right here for Christmas . No , I could n't . I really should be there in case he calls . Please , I insist . Just for dinner . All right . You bet . I always thought if I met my real mom , maybe things would be different , that I 'd figure out where I fit in . It was a tough decision she made , giving up her baby . I just wish I would have known her , or at least met her . Well , she 's part of you . She 's in you . So maybe in 50 years , I 'll look like you , huh ? If you 're lucky . You know , I never did have a grandfather . Would you be my grandfather , Al ? It 'll be my pleasure . And we 'll keep in touch ? I 'll send you cards and maybe someday , you 'll come visit me in L.A . ? Sure thing . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas to you . Do you think you could give me a ride to the airport ? I think I better be getting home now . I 'll be glad to . You did great today , Brenda , just great . - Bye . - Come on , let me see some id . - I do n't have any id . - Where do you live ? - North Pole . Smart . You got a place to live , pal ? Take a bus to the shelter downtown . You can get a free meal there tonight . Because you ca n't be hanging around here . - Merry Christmas . - Look , we 're not fooling around here . - What 's going on here ? - Do n't worry about it . - I know this guy . - You do ? Yeah , he 's Santa Claus . We have a complaint from a store over here that he 's been hassling shoppers . Has he been bothering you ? No , in fact , I work there and that 's not true at all . Look , I did n't know the police were in the habit of hassling Santa Claus on Christmas Eve . - Look , it 's not that way at all . - Do you have anywhere to go tonight ? - Oh , I have many houses to visit . Well , would you like to visit mine ? I mean , I 'm sure my mother would n't mind . Actually , she might , but she 'll get over it . I just hate to see a Santa Claus alone on Christmas Eve . Could my reindeer wait for me on your roof ? Absolutely . Just try and use the door . My dad has this thing about strange men sliding down our chimney . What can I do ? Why do n't you just go in the living room and relax ? No , really . I 'd like to help . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . - Jim Walsh . - St . Nick . St . Nick . Dad , do you guys mind if he stays for dinner ? Brenda , who is he ? Well , I sort of found him outside the store . I felt really bad for him . - Excuse us . - Me too . - Oh , hi . - Merry Christmas . Brenda , you ca n't just bring some strange guy off the street home for dinner ! Why not ? Look , it is Christmas . And he is Santa Claus . Well , who knows who 's lurking under that beard . My instincts tell me that he 's harmless . Oh , that makes me feel a lot better . Oh , I 'll get it . - Merry Christmas ! - Merry Christmas ! Jackie , Kelly , what a surprise . Brenda , you did n't tell your mom we were coming ? I have n't gotten around to it yet . - ls it all right ? - Oh , of course , of course . I thought you were having Christmas dinner with Mel . - Mel . Mel who ? - What happened ? Mel decided to spend Christmas Eve with his ex at the last minute . I 'm sorry . I have survived worse . Oh , it 's beginning to feel like a real Christmas . Hey . Hey . Merry Christmas . - I need to charter a plane . - Oh , sorry . I 'm just closing up here . I 've checked all the airlines . Every flight to L.A . is booked solid through tomorrow . I 've got ta get home tonight . This is an emergency . Wish I could help you , but this is Christmas Eve . Obviously , I 've got places to go . Come on ! Look , it 's a quick hop to L.A . You 'll be home before you know it . I 'd like to , but ... Please , you 've got ta help me . I 'm desperate . I 'll pay anything . Look , if this is n't enough , I 'll mail you a cheque for more . Hold on there , now . Let me think . Now , Dasher , now , Dancer , now , Prancer and Vixen . On Comet , on Cupid , on Donner and Blitzen ! Help yourself , everybody . There 's more than plenty . Oh , my God , Cindy , this all looks incredible . You mean tastes incredible . I have n't seen a Christmas dinner like this in a long time . Can I take your sack ? No , no , no . I 'll just hang on to it , if it 's all the same to you . Oh , I 'll get it . I mean ... Oh , well , let 's both get it . - Merry Christmas . - Andrea , how nice to see you . Well , I told Brandon I might drop by . Here . My grandmother made you a brisket . Oh , thank you . Oh , I 'm sorry , Andrea , This is Mrs . Sanders . Steve 's mom . I 've heard a lot about you . You have ? Excuse me . - Andrea ! - Hi , Brandon . I 'm glad you could make it . I hate plum pudding . Hey , everybody , look who 's here ! - Merry Christmas . - Hey , Andrea . Merry Christmas . And merry Christmas to you . - Merry Christmas . - Yeah , merry Christmas . And who are you here to visit ? My father . Well , good luck , son , and merry Christmas . Dylan . What a great surprise . Here . I got you some stuff . It 's not a lot . I just thought it would keep you entertained in here . Thanks for coming . I just guess I never expected to see you here . Why ? Well , because I just figured that you kind of hated me right about now . No . No , I do n't hate you , Dad . But when I think about all the Christmases that I spent alone with the maid while you were off in the Bahamas , or skiing , or somewhere with one of your girlfriends ... And then I remembered how much it hurt . As much as I wanted to , I just could n't leave you hanging on Christmas Eve . Yeah . Well , you know something , son , I ... You know , sometimes I think of this place like a monastery . And I 'm this monk . Because all I do is think and read and eat bad food . I always used to hate people who meditated . - Yeah , like Mom . - Yes . Yes , it always drove me crazy . I thought it was weak . But I guess that 's what I do now . I meditate . And I think about you , Dylan , and what a strong son I have , who 's out there in the world , all alone , just like I was . And here I thought it was supposed to get better . You know , the next generation . Yeah , I thought so too . Yeah . You 'll make things better , Dylan . It 's nothing fancy . Maybe we could have dinner . Do you still have that girlfriend ? Brenda . Yes , I do . Well , you go have Christmas with her , Dylan . Why ? Because you have given me probably the greatest Christmas present that I could ever ask for , more than I deserve . Now you go and make yourself happy . Dad , I 'm here for you . Bren 's got her own family . - I do n't want you to be alone . - Hey . I 'm not alone anymore . Merry Christmas , son . Merry Christmas , Dad . So , Andrea , what 'd you think of your first Christmas dinner ? Now I have to try ... - Did you make this ? - Yes . - That was a wonderful dinner , Cindy . - Thank you . Santa never goes anywhere without generously rewarding his hosts . - No , that 's really not necessary . - No , no , no , I insist . Oh , it 's beautiful . - What 's this ? - A gift from Santa . - And this one 's for you . - For me ? They 're beautiful . Mom , Dad , look . Wow , Tiffany . I do n't know if we can accept this gift . Of course we can . And let me see here . This one 's for you . - Oh , I couldn't . - Well , of course , you could . Santa has something for everybody . I do n't know what to say . We sell those in my store . You know , I hate to say this , but Brenda finds this homeless man on the street -- With a bagful of expensive merchandise . Excuse me . I 'm gon na go count the silver . Hi , I 'm Mel Silver . I think you know my son . Yes , of course . Come on in . Hi , David . Hi , Mrs . Walsh . I 'm really sorry , Jackie . I screwed up , I really blew it . You sure did . I made a stupid , stupid mistake . I just wan na ... I thought she was in trouble , that I owed it to her to be there . But you ca n't hold on forever . There 's a point where , when you separate , you just got ta really separate . I 'm sorry it did n't work out for you . I never went . I just drove around , torturing myself , feeling like a jerk . Until it hit me . You 're the one I wan na be with , Jackie . I love you . I 'm really in love with you , Jackie . What happened ? He thought my mom was in trouble and he owed it to her to be there . But he ca n't hold on forever . There 's a point when you separate , you just got ta separate . He never went . - Okay , David , that 's enough . Merry Christmas , Kelly . Merry Christmas , David . I 'll get it . - What are you doing here ? - What are you doing here ? Well , there was no snow in Mammoth , so we came home . Oh , my goodness . And I thought we were just gon na have a quiet little Christmas . - Oh , well , I can leave , if you want . - Oh , do n't be ridiculous , Donna . Just go on in and join the party . I 've just got ta go upstairs and check on something . - Hi . - Hi . Excuse me . I do n't believe this . Vintage World War I dog tags . - Outstanding . Thank you . - You 're welcome . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas . Hey , what are you guys doing here ? No snow , and they 're back together . Donna , you 'd better watch where you 're standing there . - I understand . - Good night , everyone . - Good night . Merry Christmas ! - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas . Are you sure that there 's nothing we can do ? Just pray that he 's okay . Say good night to Cindy for me . And thank you for being there . My son has some wonderful friends . - Jim ! Come up here , quick ! - Excuse me . What is it ? Well , he did n't touch the silver , but he 's taken my engagement ring ! - Are you sure ? - I 'm positive . I came up here to check the jewellery and it 's gone . - Well , is anything else missing ? - No . Brenda brings some eccentric street person into our home carrying a bagful of presents from the most expensive stores in Beverly Hills . - What are you doing ? - I 'm calling the police . I 'm sorry , Jim , but it 's our own fault , really . I mean , we 're just too generous , too trusting , too naive . I mean , we 've got to learn to be a little street-smart . What are you doing ? - What 's this ? - Well , open it . I was gon na wait until tomorrow , but under the circumstances ... My ring ! But when did you - - ? I took it to the jeweller to have it reset over a week ago . I did n't even notice it was gone . I only took it off because the stone was loose . I hardly recognise it . It 's just gorgeous . Well , when I asked you to marry me , I could n't afford much . So I always promised myself that , if I ever had the money , I 'd make up for it and give you something special . And I love you . And I love you too . - Merry Christmas . - Merry Christmas , sweetheart . - Oh , I feel like such a grinch . - Why ? Suspecting that poor sweet man of stealing my jewellery . I do n't blame you . He is a little hard to figure out . Let 's not try . I mean , just for tonight , I 'm gon na stay naive and pretend that people are honest and it 's a safe world we live in . And there really is a Santa Claus and he 's sitting in our living room right now . Why not ? I mean , he 's got ta spend Christmas Eve somewhere . Steve ? Steve ? - Steve ! - Mom , where have you been ? Where have I been ? I 've been waiting an hour for you to come home . You do n't know what it took to get here . I do n't think you 'll be happy when you find out how much it cost . - I know . But you 're here now . I had to do it . I had to find out who my real mom was . And was she everything you expected ? Everything and more . - I see . - Let me tell you about her . She 's beautiful and she 's caring . And she created me out of her love , 1 7 years of it . And with her busy life , she always made sure I was as happy as I could be . She always tried to show me to do the right thing . She was always there for me when I did n't . Gave me everything I ever wanted and probably more than I deserved . And no matter what , she always let me know how much she loved me . I 'm sorry I had to go so far away to find you , Mom . Oh , gorgeous . I 'm just so glad you 're back . - And I promise you one thing . - Would n't you say , Bren ? - More or less . But I 'm not really into Christmas . I mean , I like it , it just kind of bums me out . Why 's that ? Well , you know how Christmas is always everybody 's favourite holiday , except their own birthday ? Well , my birthday is on Christmas and nobody ever remembers . They give me Christmas presents and call them birthday presents , or give me birthday presents and call them Christmas presents . And I never get a cake or my own party . Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday , dear Donna Happy birthday to you - I 'll get it . - Who 's next ? Andrea . - Come on , Andrea . Come on . - Oh , come on-- Oh , please , guys -- Merry Christmas , Bren . Dylan , I ca n't believe you 're here ! How 's your dad ? He 's good . - Mom , Dad , guess who 's here ! - We see . - Merry Christmas , Dylan . - Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas , sir . Merry Christmas , Dylan . Even when I was little , I did n't believe in Santa . I thought it was pointless to ask for anything . We did n't have a chimney or Christmas tree , but I do n't know , somehow , sitting here makes me ... What the hell . You know what I want ? I want a computer date book , I want bubble bath , oh , and there 's -- Hey , everybody , look who 's here . - Hi , Dylan ! - Hey , Dylan . Merry Christmas , man . How 's the old man ? Did n't I see you somewhere earlier today , Santa ? I do n't think so . I 've been here the whole evening . - You have to know where to find him . - Kelly ! I wanted to know what happened to the magic of Christmas . I did n't believe it existed anymore . You see , for over 40 years , Mrs . Claus and I lived in a big house high up on the hill , and she made the most wonderful Christmas dinner . We had a big tree with loads of presents for lots of little elves . But the elves grew up and they moved away , some of them , far away , and had elves of their own . Santa used to visit them UPS and Mrs . Claus always made sure they got their gifts on time . And even though it was only she and Santa left in this big house , she still made the most splendid Christmas dinners . But last year , Mrs . Claus died . And as far as I was concerned , Christmas died with her . I was beginning to believe the only place Santa belonged in this town was in jail . Until that girl took in a lonely old man for dinner . Thank you , Brenda , for making me believe again in the spirit of Christmas . You 're welcome . I do n't know who it could be . Everybody we know is already here . We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Good tidings we bring To you and your kin Good tidings for Christmas And a happy New Year We all know that Santa 's coming We all know that Santa 's coming We all know that Santa 's coming And soon will be here Oh , it 's great . You guys go and then I 'll catch up with you down the street . - Merry Christmas . - Oh , I like that . - Merry Christmas , Nat . - Merry Christmas . That reminds me . I found my Santa outfit . The busboy moved it and put it under the counter . - Cool . - Hey , come on , everyone . Let 's go in the living room and sing some carols of our own . Oh , Jim , you 're not gon na play the organ , are you ? As a matter of fact , I am . Give him a break , Mom . It is the holiday season . Okay , come on . All right , come on in , everyone . Gather around . Here we go . All right . Now , we all know this one . What 's going on here ? - I do n't know , man . You tell me . He was waiting for me when I got home , wondering where I had been . - Can you imagine ? - Merry Christmas , buddy . - lt 's good to see you . - lt 's good to see you too , man . It 's great to be home , really . You know what else ? - What ? - I 'm starving . Well , come on , you came to the right place . I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the treetops glisten And children listen To hear sleighbells in the snow I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days be merry and bright And may all your Christmases Be white Merry Christmas , everybody ! Merry Christmas ! 
@@5232541 : Legend holds that buried somewhere in the Iraqi desert is a fabled book penned by ancient mystics known as the Akashic Records , believed to be a written account of all significant events throughout time . Powerful stuff . If someone were to get their hands on that , they could win the lottery . Or at least get tenure .  To know the future brings , obviously , ultimate power . Which is why everyone from Herod to Hitler has been looking for the records . But to find them ... To find them , one needs a map . This tablet , found in the lvory Coast last year , is believed to be the very map . Although the engravings are of a lost language so far indecipherable to even scholars like myself . But we 're close . Whoever can decipher them first will know the exact latitude and longitude - of the Akashic Records . - My God , that 's it . - Uh , excuse me ? - No , no . Excuse me . And it 's all in here . The location of the Akashic Records . Now , they 're gon na come after me just like they came after you . But I 'm gon na be ready for them , Dad . - Hey . - Hey . - How 's he doing today ? - The same . Thanks for always keeping his room so cheerful . I really appreciate it . Oh , do n't mention it . I mean , for all we know , he knows they 're here too . Is n't that why you keep talking to him ? Eric , can I speak to you alone , please ? Oh . Uh , yeah . Outside .  - I 'm not moving him , Dr Stone . - Eric , it 's been six weeks . This facility is not designed for long-term maintenance . Maintenance ? That 's my father you 're talking about . And he 's gon na get better . Eric , wait ! Ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh . - I think Jack 's a warlock . - Who ? Jack . Jack Sheridan , the Internet-auction guy - I met , remember ? - Uh-huh . I went to go get coffee , he was standing in front of me , and then I went straight to the newsstand , and wham , he was right there reading a magazine . He went from one place to another in the blink of an eye . - You think he blinked . - Well , yeah . I mean , that 's what warlocks do , right ? Where 's Phoebe ? She 's volunteering at the convalescent hospital . Great . Wait . You have to know if there 's a warlock test . Me ? Why would I know ? Well , I ... I mean , you are a warlock magnet . Am I never going to live Jeremy down ? You know , you had that Rex-and-Hannah thing at work . - What 's up with the suitcase ? - A little overnighter . Dan 's friend is getting married in Tahoe , and Dan invited me to come along . In-the-same-hotel in-the-same-bed sort of thing ? That has yet to be decided . Oh , so then this is just tennis outfit , right ? Give it . Thank you . I mean , you did test him , right ? You know that he 's not a warlock ? He 's not a warlock . No cats have hissed at him , he has not blinked , he has not tried to kill me or my sisters and steal our powers , which , as you know , is a key indicator . I need the Book of Shadows . Ah !  Oh , I 'll get it . - Hello , you . - Hi , um ... I was wondering if maybe we could get an earlier start . You know , miss traffic , get there quicker so we could have enough time to ... - Relax ? - Mmm .  I wonder what her problem is . I got ta go now . Bye . Prue ! Did you find that warlock test yet ? Nineteen warlock-specific death spells and not one test . What if it 's a conspiracy ? Jack and Dan working together , sweet-talking , and the whole time , they 're figuring out how to kill us . - Okay , now you 're getting paranoid . - Well , how can we not , with warlocks and demons coming out of the woodwork all the time ? - It 's a wonder we trust anybody . - We don't . - Here it is . - " To hear secret thoughts " ? We can hear Jack and Dan 's thoughts just long enough to confirm or deny our suspicions . - No personal gain . - Purely for protection .  Okay . - What , I ca n't borrow your lipstick ? - I did n't say that Prue , I thought it . - Whatever . Just learn to share . I heard that . - This could be very dangerous . - Stay calm . Calm down . Book of Shadows , needles and warlocks . And Eric 's in trouble . Find out who . Find out what . The hospital hottie ? What ? Uh , how 's Eric ? Did you see him today ? Uh , why is the Book of Shadows down here , girls ? - Jack blinked . - And Kit hissed at Dan . Right . And we think that they may be warlocks , so we were looking for a test so that we could test them . - Hello , paranoid ? - We are not . Able to find a spell in the Book of Shadows . Well , just prick him . Warlocks do n't bleed . So if there 's no blood , you got your answer . - Should we reverse it ? Not until we know if they 're really ... - Are you two okay ? - So how 's Eric ? - Has he asked you out yet ? - No , but he 's in trouble . I had a premonition today . A demon , or a warlock , maybe , with a needle thingy on his finger , and he was sticking it into Eric 's head . So I came home to see what we 're up against . You guys go deal with Jack and Dan , and I 'll look on the Internet , and I 'll tell you if I find anything . Great , we 're surrounded by warlocks . Next time , get your own damn lipstick . - I heard that . - I love you . Bite me .  - Prue . - Jack , you actually wear that to work ? Ooh , feisty , feisty . My what ? Verschwang Publications , the German conglomerate . You handled their CEO 's bronze-miniature collection for the Internet auction , right ? Be careful . She suspects . Yeah , of course . Well , I need some bronzes checked out . Who did your validation ? Uh-oh . Validation ? You do have people 's collections validated , do n't you ? Mostly , I put people in graves , or I incinerate them . Oh , yeah . It was Walt Potock at Berkeley School of Design . He 's the best . If she finds out I 'm lying , she 's gon na die . Well , you know what , I 'm a little late . Got ta go . Good to see you again . You 're dying first .  You ready ? Um , can you come in ? - Uh , where 's your suitcase ? - Upstairs .  I see . Uh-oh . Cold feet . She 's backing out . It 's okay . Do n't push it . Okay , um , this is gon na hurt me a lot more than it 's gon na hurt you . Piper , we have to get to Eric . What 's the matter ? He did n't bleed . He 's not bleeding . There 's no blood . There 's nothing . Uh , yeah . Of course he 's not bleeding . He 's frozen , his blood is frozen . - Yeah . Right . - Uh-huh . - Okay , go back upstairs . Go . - Yeah . Okay . Ow ! - What the hell was that ? - You 're bleeding . It 's ... Just a little bit . Love her touch . If she does n't wan na go , it 's okay . Do n't force it .  - Dan , listen . I really want to go . - But ? - He 's bleeding . - He 's lucky . Hi . And I 'll be back in time . - Yeah , I hope so . - Later . Whew .   Oh , that 's what 's scaring Kit . It 's ... You got hornets . - It 's probably what stung me too . - Yeah , um , probably . Okay , got ta go . Um ... Do n't leave without me . - Okay , got ta go , got ta go . - Uh-huh .  They 're called " collectors . " They 're a warlock ...  They 're a warlock breed that drains knowledge out of people 's brains with that weird finger I saw . The Book did n't say how to vanquish them ? No , it just said , " Their hunger for knowledge is your ally . " Okay , whatever that means . Are you sure this is where he lives ? That 's what the hospital record said . 5D , here it is .  Oh , Piper ! Oh , okey-dokey . All right , let 's get him out of here . We 'll figure out what they want later . - Okay , ready ? - Uh-huh . - You do a little thingy . - Okay .   Get out of here ! Get him out of here ! Get back .    Oh , my God .  Okay , let 's go , let 's go ! They put my father in the hospital . They took his mind . - Who do you think they are ? - NSA , CIA , who knows ? Somebody in bulletproof vests . The question is , who are you ? Friends . Yeah , right . They 're after the Akashic Records too . - What are the Akashic Records ? - I knew it . Wait , what did you just say ? The Akashic Records , what are they ? - You tell me . - I 'll tell you . They 're a book of ancient prophecies . How did you ... ? - You 're well informed . - I read a lot . How did you know that ? - I 'll tell you later . So they want those records . And they want Eric because he knows how to find them , right ? - Who are you people ? - What if it 's not a legend ? Say they 're real . What happens if the bad guys get these records ? And they use the future against us ? No more us , the bad guys win . - I got ta get my father out of there . - No , wait , Eric . He 's stuck in the hospital . Dr Stone 's in on it . Eric , it is not about your father anymore . It 's about you , especially if they think you know - how to find the Akashic Records . - Try and stop me . PHOEBEGRUNTS , ERICSCREAMS How ?  - Entertaining guest , I see . - Hi . Two warlocks called collectors want what 's in his brain : the location of the Akashic Records . A lost text that predicts all future events . Collectors get it , the world 's a goner . - It 's a ... - It 's a lost text that predicts all future events . The collectors get it , the world 's a goner , I know . Okay , does someone wan na tell me what 's going on here ? Have to tell her now . Okay . Um , Phoebe , see , Piper and I did n't really know about the whole pricking thing to expose a warlock . So we sort of cast a little hearing- thoughts spell just to find things out . Oh , a hearing-thoughts spell . - Dan 's clean , by the way . - Glad to hear it . Jack 's not . Wait , are you guys thinking something about me right now ? No . Really bad . You know , graves , dead people , burnt bodies . - Did you prick him ? - No , that 's why I need Piper . Freeze him , prick him and then vanquish him if necessary . Where did you get that ? Remember the troubled priest with the warlock brothers ? Well , they left this behind , and I 've sort of hung on to it , just in case we needed it for future warlock use . Wow , it 's been a while , but it seems like they 're everywhere . Okay , you two go to it . I 'll stay here . - What if the collectors show up ? - Well , just get back before they do . And do n't lose that dagger . We have to go kill a warlock while she sits on some guy 's ... Hey , hey , hey ! You heard that ? Like I need a hearing-thoughts spell to know what you 're thinking . - Did you find Eric ? - No . Not good . He 's being protected by a time-freezing witch . And Bruce Lee 's little sister . The Akashic Records are within our reach . It 's going to be very difficult to drain his brain if they know what we 're after . Not to worry . We 'll get into his mind through his heart . Oh , very nice .  Ah , there she is , hard at work . - I 'm glad you called . Can I come in ? - Sure . Stay focused . Get it over with . Freeze him .  - Huh . - The dagger , his hand , just kind of poke him . - He 's not bleeding . - He 's frozen . Oh , yeah . Okay , okay , okay . Wait a minute . Okay . - Ooh . - Hey , any survivors ?  - Okay , there 's two of them . If that prick does n't bleed , - then that one 's dead too . - All right . All right , let them go .  , THENJACKYELLS What ? What 's the matter , she bite you ? You should n't be here . Come on , man , I could n't let you take all the blame . He 's bleeding . All right , this is my sister Piper . Which one of you jerks is Jack ? Uh , I 'm the jerk . This is my twin brother , Jeff . Hey . Nice to meet you . Look , sorry for the little tap dance earlier . Mmm . So , what exactly was it that you guys were trying to prove ? It 's just a little something we used to do growing up . Yeah , so when one of us would take an interest in someone ... Do n't get the wrong idea . Good point . So , uh , Jeff , what is it that you do for a living ? Oh , great , this should be a conversation stopper . I own a mortuary . Actually , a whole chain of them . - Mortuaries . - Put them in graves , set them on fire . - Mm-hm . - Huh ? You know , you two should be ashamed of yourselves . - Ooh . - That 's for thinking that you could get away with it . And that 's for thinking that you would n't get slapped . Piper .  I approve . How did you know to be there to help me ? - Uh , that 's a long story . - Wait . Shorten it . I have this gift . I sort of know when things are gon na happen , if there 's gon na be trouble . - How ? - Just something I was born with . So you do n't work for some government agency ? No . This thing that you did , translating this ancient code or whatever why did you do it ? - I did it for my father . - To finish his work ? - People hurt him . And I wanted to find out who , and I wan na get even . - Even at the risk of them hurting you ? - He 's my dad . I love him . And if I ca n't have him back , I want justice . - I envy you . - You 're not close to your folks ? My mom is dead . - I 'm sorry . - And my dad is gone . You do n't know where he is ? I 'm not really that interested . - I do n't understand that . - You do n't know my dad . Do you ? Huh . No , I never got the chance to , unfortunately . Okay . I 'm a sucker for family . Follow me . - Jack 's not a warlock . - He 's a jerk . Come on .  Where is everybody ? - Did you bring that dagger ? - Yep . - Dad ! - Eric , wait ! Dad , we got ta get you out of here . - Eric . - I 'm getting him out of here , Phoebe .  - What 's going on ? - Later . Get him . We got ta get out of here . Where did they go ? Looking for that ? He 's got the dagger .  Piper !  Move , and she dies .    Dad ? Eric . Eric , we still wan na help you . Nothing has changed . No , everything has changed . Some kind of monsters just took my dad . - They 're called warlocks . - Warlocks ? What does that make the three of you ? Witches .  Forgive me , but what you 're saying is insane . But you now know that it is n't . So is n't it possible that other things like witches and warlocks actually do exist ? Maybe , but why would warlocks want my dad ? They 're probably gon na offer you a trade : your dad for what 's in your head . And they can appear any time , anyplace . Which is why we need to get you back to the manor . You 'll be safer there than anywhere else . Okay , look , Eric , I am the same girl you met at the hospital a few weeks ago . The only thing that 's changed is , now you know our secret . - It 's one hell of a secret . - Yeah , and I trust you with it . So please trust me in return . Look , if we 're gon na save your father , we have to keep you safe until we figure out what we 're gon na do . You do that . - Do we have to protect him ? - He is pissing me off . - Eric , what are you doing ? - You 'll see . We should n't be out in the open like this . It 's not safe . Then go . I have something I have to do . What ? What do you have to do ? Get busted , Eric ? That ... Wow . That 's the map stone , is n't it ? Yeah . My father thought it would be so wonderful translating it . A gift of knowledge to usher the world into the new millennium . Ooh . What are you doing ? If the Akashic Records are everything you say they are , they 're not a gift . I mean , the warlocks should n't have that knowledge . Neither should the rest of us . With all knowledge revealed , we could have no free will . And no world as we know it . Maybe no world at all . Oh , my God ! The only place the longitude exists is in my head . I 'll get security . - Poor Eric . - He 'll be okay . We 'll figure this out . Yeah . In the meantime , warlocks have his father . I ca n't imagine how helpless he must feel . I can . Prue , a warlock did n't take our father . No , he left on his own . - Do you miss him ? - I did n't say that . - Do you think about him ? - Why ? Because I 'm wondering if I 'm the only one who does . - No , you 're not . - So you miss him . I miss who he should have been , and I miss who he never was , but I do n't miss him . I do . All right , can we get to work ? Okay , let 's save someone else 's father instead . And they 'll kill his dad . Well , Eric is our innocent . Our priority is him . Yeah , but they 're both innocents . Piper , I hope it does n't come to this , but we may have to make a choice . Why ? I mean , there 's got ta be another way , with all the hocus-pocus we have . Still may not be enough . I mean , we 're talking about the future , everyone 's future . So we have to sacrifice Eric 's dad ? For the greater good . Man , you can dress it up any way you want , it still stinks . You know what , it sucks .   Oh , that 's Dan . I got ta go deal with him . You got ta figure out what we 're gon na say to Phoebe . Hey . You ready to go ? Oh , man . I 'm just not quite ready yet . Piper . Any word from the pizza guy ? Hi , Dan . We ordered pizza . Would you like to stay for pizza ? No , I wan na go . With her . But what 's the point ? Okay , okay , I know what you 're thinking ... Piper ! - But I can be ready on time . - Okay . Well , I have to leave in an hour , I 'm gon na be late for this wedding rehearsal . So car 's gon na leave at 6 . I hope to see you in it . Okay . Someday , some way , somehow , I 'm gon na make it through that damn door . Have the warlocks made contact yet ? Uh , no , not yet . Where have you guys been ? Well , Eric destroyed the map stone , so we 're covered there . Did you guys find anything in the Book ? You tell her . Eric , why do n't you go check your messages at home . - Maybe they tried to contact you there . - Okay . What 's going on ? Can we talk ? You have no new messages . Wait , you 're willing to let Eric 's father die ? We ca n't risk losing Eric and allow the warlocks to gain future knowledge . But not at the expense of his father . We have to save him . Phoebe , we have to save everyone 's dad . We have to protect the whole world from these warlocks . And we ca n't do it if they have the Records . So , what am I supposed to tell Eric , that we might have to sacrifice his father ? I ca n't do that . I promised him that we would save him . - Phoebe . - You do n't even care . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . I do n't know why I even thought it .  - Hello ? - Eric . I assume you know who this is . - Where 's my father ? - Oh , you do know . Good . Say hello to Eric , Ben . - Eric ? Son ? - Dad ? I feel so odd . Dad ! Dad ! Oh , he 's gone , Eric . But I can bring him back and give him to you . All I want in exchange is what 's in your head . - Where can I find you ? - The oak grove , the west end of Golden Gate Park . Half an hour . Alone . Without the witches . Eric ? - Any messages ? - Uh , no , not yet . Eric ... Before you say another word , I just wan na say thank you for everything you 've done for my father . I mean , everything you 're trying to do . You sure you 're not an angel ?  No , I 'm no angel . He would be so proud of you . Uh , Eric , I need to talk to you about you and your dad . Okay . Maybe we should have another cup of tea first . - Okay , I 'll go get it . - Thanks . Eric , where are you going ? Uh , I 'm just gon na go out , get some air . The oak grove , Golden Gate Park . Phoebe ! Yeah ? - Where is he going ? - He was thinking Golden Gate Park . Oh , my God , the warlocks must have contacted him . All right , there are oak trees everywhere . - What if we 're too late ? - Phoebe , stop thinking that . Would you get out of my head , please ? The Book of Shadows said that their hunger is our ally . So there must be a way to use the knowledge that they 've acquired against them . Or use their greed to trap them . And save his father , right ? Look , it just seems to me we should do everything we possibly can to reunite Eric and his father . I mean , imagine , a dad who actually wants to be with his child . Pheebs , we 'll do our best . Okay . Then we should split up . The first one that sees him hollers . BIRDCAWS , THENPRUESCREAMS - Dad ! WARLOCK : That 's close enough , Eric . I can restore him , or I can kill him , Eric . That choice is mine . Restore him , or you do n't get what you want . That choice is mine . No , no , no , no , no , you ca n't bargain , Eric . We 're in control here . Let 's check again . Who 's got the upper hand ? Have n't you been paying attention ? That gun wo n't do anything to us . No , but it will blow my head off .  Restore him . Now . - Dad ? - Eric . Son , what are you doing ? Dad !  You 're mine now , Eric ! Like I said , we 're in control .     , THENWARLOCKSCREAMS Phoebe .  PIPER : Prue , watch out ! That 's right , witches . Come and get me . Do n't blink . Keep them focused on me . Let him surprise them from behind . - Wait , do n't freeze him . - Why not ? Did n't you hear his thoughts ? He 's playing decoy . Let him think that it 's working .     You know , they really should n't have given us the finger . You read my mind .  Prue ? Piper ? Are you okay ? I think so . What are we doing in the park ?  Who are those people ? - You do n't recognize Eric ? - No . - That was three weeks ago . Oh . - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Just a little confused . What am I doing here ? You do n't recognize her ? No . Wait , I think I 've seen you at the hospital . - Who 's the cute guy ? - Shh .  - Dad ? - Eric . Oh , my God ! You 're ... You 're better ! - What 's going on ? What 's happening ? - I do n't know . - Did we do something good ? - You did something incredible . - Okay , what am I thinking ? - Uh ... That Dan 's gon na leave without me . - Nope . Good , the spell is reversed . - What a relief . I think we 've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that man and , especially , woman are n't meant to hear each other 's thoughts . Definitely . - So , what were you thinking ? I was thinking what it shame it was that Phoebe finally met a nice guy , and she 's not even gon na remember it .  - Hi . - Hi . - Hi . - Uh , they 're gorgeous . They 're for you . The florist left them on the porch . But there 's no card . - They 're huge . - They 're expensive .  They 're ringing . - Ooh . Hello ? - Oh , no ! Dan ! He 's leaving . Without me . - Do n't just stand there , freeze him . - Oh , right .  I got ta go . It 's such a nifty little power . Oh , honey ... Open .  - Hello ? - At last . I 've been calling you every 20 minutes for the last hour . - Did you like the flowers ? - Jack , what do you want ? You know , you are a very suspicious woman . Oh , come on , Prue , are you saying you 've been totally honest with me ?  Jack , I ca n't hear you , the phone 's breaking up ! I just ... I wanted to apologize . Can I ... ? Can I take you for dinner ? - I do n't think so . - Come on . Let me buy you a drink . - I do n't think so . - Can I at least get my phone back ? I do n't think so .   - Oh , I like it . - What are you doing ? I 'm calling Tokyo . Konnichiwa . Excuse me . I 'm looking for a Dr Schlenzig . I need him to sign some insurance papers . I was told he 'd be in here . Uh , yeah , he actually just took Mrs Bruen to the sunroom . - You could probably catch him there . - Great . Thanks . You 're Phoebe , right ? I 'm Eric Bragg . He 's almost back to his old self . I remember you were really sweet to him when he was in here . Not many people would have bothered . - You must be an angel . - No , I 'm no angel . But I could probably introduce you to one if you 'd like . You know , I just realized , I have no idea where the sunroom is . Um , it 's kind of complicated . Maybe I should draw you a map .

My lovely wife Clara has been persuading me to organize all of the junk I 've collected over the years . Huh ! This was my entry into the 1932 Hill Valley junior science fair . Huh , a videotape recorder with full 14-day programming capability . It worked perfectly . Too bad there were n't any TV sets around . This . Oops . Might as well take a look . After years of tinkering and fine tuning , it 's finally perfected . The deep-thinking , mind-reading helmet ! The ultimate thinking cap . A penny for my thoughts . ANNOUNCER : Doc Brown 's mind-reading helmet only $19.95 , plus $2 shipping and handling . So you do n't forget , call before midnight tonight . 1-800 ... That 's enough of that ! Hey ! What 's this ? Why , this was n't mine at all . This belonged to Clara 's father , Daniel Clayton . Now , there was a great man ! I first met him years ago , back in 1850 . That was before I met Clara . Come to think of it , that was five years before Clara was even born ! It all started with my son , Vernie ... VERNE : Ah , go ahead , vaporize me , ya dumb three-headed alien geeks !   DOC : The head bone 's connected to the neck bone , the neck bone 's connected to the shoulder bone , the shoulder bone 's connected to the ...   ... hip bone . No , that ca n't be correct . Hello , Father . Post-meridian greetings , offspring . I trust school went well . I discovered two new elements in chemistry class . Well , everyone 's entitled to a slow day now and then . How about you , Verne ? It was horrible . Very good , then .  Ah , thank you , thank you , ladies and ... Woah ! Ow , watch it , Verne ! Hey ! Who do you think I am , Axl Rose ? VERNE : Sorry , Marty . I bet your grandfathers did important stuff , too . Like what ? Does n't Clara tell a story about how her mom and dad met on the Oregon Trail ? Oh , yeah . She 's told me a million times .  It was love at first sight . The rough-and-tumble pioneer and that timid little greenhorn from back east . They were married the same day they met , and their wedding announcement was burned into this piece of buckboard from their wagon . Whoa . That was great . Yeah , sometimes I call in and excuse myself from school . So why do n't you tell stinkin ' ol ' Roland Culver about Daniel Clayton , the rough-and-tumble pioneer who rode The Oregon Trail ? Cool ! But I 'll need some evidence . I got it ! I 'll go back and see grandpa in person ! A silly notion indeed , brother . I 'm just gon na take his stinkin ' picture . Despite the photograph , not even Roland Culver would believe that your grandfather lived 150 years ago . I du n no . Roland 's pretty bad at arithmetic . There ! I 'm heading to the 19th century ! Who 's with me ? I repeat , Verne , this is a fool 's errand . Does that mean you 're comin ' ? JULES : Voila , brother Verne . 1850 Wyoming . Are you sure this is the right place ? Have faith , fraternal unit . A microscopic analysis of the dirt particles embedded in the buckboard , cross-referenced to my soil sample collection , tells me that our destination is approximately this point along the famous Oregon Trail . Hey , I still got the same hat ! What a gyp ! It 's a good thing Doc customized the DeLorean for the Hill Valley Pioneer Days Parade .  Hey , what 's that rumbling ? Ah ! Yes , my analysis of the seismic vibrations tell me that we should expect 20 ... No , make that 21 wagons . Jules , that 's a lot of bull-oney ! Eh , eh , correction , Verne , it 's a lot of buffalo ! VERNE : Tatanka !   It 's a stinkin ' stampede ! Safe ! MARTY : I hope you 're right ! I 've been shot ! I doubt if any of those buffalo are carrying rifles .  Oh , yeah ?  MARTY : Hey , check it out . We 've got company . Could it be ? Grandpa ? Hiya , grand ... Mother ? Grandmother ? What 's yer problem , boy ? A buffalo kick you in the head ? Hello , handsome . Ai n't you purdy . Uh , thanks . Thanks a lot . Where have you been all my life ? Uh , in the future ? BOTH : Uh-oh . MAN : Yo ! Howdy strangers ! Greetings . Hi . MAN 3 : Aloha . Whoa ! Dadgumit , Clayton ! Will you pay attention ? Whoa ! Oops . Sorry . Clayton ? That 's Grandpa ? I hope Roland Culver never hears about this . Mighty fancy wagon ya got there , pilgrim , but looks like you 're shy a mule or two . VERNE : Jules , why ca n't we go home ? I do n't wan na take Grandpa 's picture now . He 's a first-class wimp ! As I explained , Verne , we can not return home until I have repaired the bovine damage done to the DeLorean . Not to mention the damage we 've done to history . Oh , yeah ? Like what ? Like causing our grandmother to fall in love with Martin rather than our grandfather . Please , Martha , take my word for it . We ca n't get hitched . Marty , I ai n't turning ' you loose until you promise to walk down the aisle with me . All right , but do n't you try nothing ! It is now up to us to make sure that our grandmother and grandfather fall in love at first sight . Come back , ya little varmint ! Yeah , but she only has eyes for Marty . Augh ! Hey , why are you hiding from the beautiful Miss O'Brien ? Meow ! Since she 's joined the wagon train , I can hardly keep my mind on my insects . Oh , man . She 's really got you bugged ! CLAYTON : Hey , but she does n't know I 'm alive . MARTY : Danny boy , when Martha sees you , it 'll be love at first sight . MAN : Yee-haw ! Move it on there , little doggies . Let 's pick it up , stragglers . Remember , no fishing ' now ! Listen and listen tight . It 's chow time .   What are y'all staring ' at ? I got somethin ' in my teeth ? Well , howdy , smelly ol ' stranger . Watch it . Nobody calls me old . No , sir . You 're young ... But smelly . Hmm , that 's better . Got any vittles ? Sure . What do you want to hear ? I 'm talkin ' about grub , bub ! Well , tumblin ' tumbleweeds ! A prairie angel if ever I seen one ! All right , Danny boy . You 're up . Hey , uh ... And he 's down . Are n't you a sight . Are n't you a smell . Thank ya . How 's about you joining ' me fer dinner ? How 's about you stuff your head in a prairie dog hole ? Say , that ai n't very friendly ! I do n't trust that smelly ol ' stranger . He do n't trust me , huh ? Not to mention the fact he done called me old once again . Hello , Martin . Uh , hi . Uh , gee , I 'd love to stay and chat , but I got ta go milk the buffalo . Oh ! I thought you rode side saddle ! You ... You buzzard ! Hold on there , little lady . I would n't want you gettin ' these nice folks all het up over nuthin . '  Maybe I 'd better just take you along fer the ride . Grandma ! Bring back my grammy , you stinkin ' ol ' smelly stranger !  Not since ... Clara ! What has transpired ? Somebody 's gone and sanded Ma and Pa 's wedding announcement clean off this buckboard , that 's what . When I find out who did it , they 're in big trouble . Do I make myself clear ? Galloping Galileo ! " Martha O'Brien and Daniel Clayton , " joint together here as man and wife , March 3rd , 1850 . " I 'll handle this , Clara . Why do n't you lie down ? And do n't look in any mirrors ! Sure , this is a wilderness now , but pilgrims such as us are taming ' this new frontier . Before ya know it , a railroad train will cut a swath right through the very land we set on .  Uh-huh . What 'd I tell ya ? Doc ! Father ! What is everyone staring at ? Have n't you seen a steam locomotive before ? Well , do n't these things usually run on tracks ? Drat ! I knew there was something I forgot ! Father ! How did you find us ? Well , it was n't easy ! Do you know how many wagon trains there are on the Oregon Trail this time of year ? Since you boys left home , your mother has started to fade . Hey , pardon me , Martin , but have you seen the lovely Miss O'Brien about ? Dan Clayton , I presume . Why , yes . Do I know you ? DOC : You will . Hey , that 's great , is n't it ? Yeah . We was robbed ! The cash box is gone ! And so 's that smelly old stranger ! Wild Bill Tannen . But , hey , he does n't like to be called old . BOTH : Tannen ? Bummer ! It appears I have arrived in the proverbial nick of temporal measurement . Oh , do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike Hmm , hmm , something rhymes with Pike , hmm hmm ... Hmm , oh , well . Fifty-three bottles of pop on the wall Fifty-three bottles of pop Here we be , little lady . Home sweet home . It do n't look like much now , but once you use yer femi-nine wiles ... Let her go , ya stinkin ' ol ' smelly goon ! Hi-ya !  Uh-oh . Thank ya , son . Now why do n't you just step over here and join us . DOC : Which way did they go , Einie ?  What 'd he say , Doc ? He said do n't ask him . He 's got a cold . That ought a hold you two . What 's this ? One of them doohickeys that you peeps into to see the hootchie-kootchie dancer ? Uh , yeah . Push the red button and she 'll wink at you .  Let 's see here ... Whoa ! VERNE : Aw , look . The big stinkin ' smelly ol ' jerk busted my camera . Things could be worser .   VERNE : I think they is . I mean , are .  There goes our shooting ' iron .  MARTHA : Twere n't no joke , son . JULES : Father , observe ! Down yonder ! Jumpin ' gigawatts ! It 's Vernie ! Oh ... There 's Grammy Clayton ! Er , Miss O'Brien . Zounds ! I knew this territory appeared familiar ! We 're in the middle of the 2,219,790.71 acres which will eventually become Yellowstone National Park ! Thanks for the travelogue , Doc , but your mother-in-law is about to become Purina bear chow . Attention , Vernie ! Dad ? Oh , there he is . Hi , Pop ! Drop the buffalo hide over that hole behind you , and sit down ! He 's plumb loco if he thinks I 'm sittin ' down in front of this critter . DOC : Hurry , son ! Well , he 's my daddy , and I 'm in enough trouble already . DOC : Someone help me with this wagon cover . If my calculations are correct , we have mere seconds . That Buffalo hide should provide adequate insulation . Now , give me a shove ! Hey , I 'm coming along ! Hey , what a smooth ride ! Pop ! I 'm a-comin ' , Vernie boy ! Hey , I can see my wagon from here . It 's great to see you , Dad ! VERNE : Yeah ! DOC : You 've got some explaining to do , young man ! Well , hello , handsome . Daniel , Martha , I now pronounce you husband and wife . Now go ahead and kiss the pretty girl . Yeah , uh-huh . Does " together " have two " g 's " or one ? MAN : Uh , two ! Oh , my gracious ! A brand new species ! And I 'll designate it ... VERNE : The Lepidoptera Martha . And my grandpa discovered it . Oh , very impressive , Verne . Thank you . Brown , you got a cool grandpa . Thanks , Roland Culver , but wait 'll you hear about my grammy . AUTOMATED VOICE : Photographic systems operational . Heh , heh ... Do n't worry , I 'm not mad . That 's just geyser talk . What 's a geyser , you ask ? Access video encyclopedia , section G for geyser . AUTOMATED VOICE : Section G . Entry , geysers . DOC : That 's a geyser . The most famous geyser in the world . Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park . The very same geyser that launched Verne and Grammy Clayton to safety . How do they work ? Well , geysers are natural hot springs created by geothermal energy . As you can see here , the inside of the earth is molten rock . Sometimes this heated rock makes its way up near the earth 's surface and water flows through it . When this happens , we get large amounts of hot water and steam . To demonstrate , our very own geyser can be created in the lab . As the water boils in the bottom of the beaker , it forms water vapor bubbles , just like a real geyser . At this point the hot water expands and literally wants to let off some steam . This steam looks for the path of least resistance to the surface . In our case , the tube of the funnel , and ...  We 've got an instant geyser ! With a little powdered chocolate and a few marshmallows , we 've also got a pretty good cup of cocoa .  See you in the future !  Hey , buckaroos . I got one fer ya . What has one horn and gives milk ? You give up ? A milk truck !

Is " fodgrf " a word ? If you ca n't say it , it 's probably not a word . Ok , fine . " Darvog " ? - What ? - I challenge . " Darvog " is a word . Use it in a sentence . I just did . " Darvog " is a word . That 's a sentence . Do you not know what a sentence is ? Because if you do n't know what a sentence is , we should n't play . It would be like playing with a child . You want something to eat ? I am darvogged . I just invented a new sandwich . I took peanut butter and spread it on a piece of bread . And then , on the other piece of bread , I put some jelly . Do n't move . Why ? Spider . Where ? Where is it ? Is it on me ? Get it off me ! Get out of the way ! - Uhh huh huh ! - Where did it go ? What did it look like ? It was the biggest spider I 've ever seen . Ooh ! Ooh ! Uhh ! What are you doing ? I 'm gon na kill it . Are you mad ? You ca n't do that . You need to capture it and take it outside ... And then kill it . We do n't want that mess in here . The maid just cleaned . We do n't have a maid . I meant you . Hey , guys ! Uhh ! Spider ! Lola ! Oh , did you like that lamp ? Let me get you another one . Seriously , it 's no problem . I can go right now . I 'm 8 hours early for our date anyway . I do n't see the spider . Oh , I missed him . Well , time to go lamp shopping ! You know what , I should go help Lola with that lamp . Lamps can be pretty tricky . Wait for me ! I 'm not getting killed by a spider today ! A jpb ? I think that sounds good . I invented a sandwich once . You take a piece of bread , a piece of cheese , a bunch of ice cream , a little more bread , some fish sticks , a little syrup , and then the heel of the bread . I call it a darvog . Ah ! I knew that was a word . You ca n't do anything until he 's been missing for 24 hours ? But this is an emergency ! You 're the police ! What if something terrible 's happened to him ? No , you calm down ! I ca n't stand it ! We 're looking for a lamp . What 's a tosh ? Tosh , my dear friend ! He went to mail a letter , but he never came back ! Oh , dear . How long has he been gone ? 10 minutes ! Oh , poor thing . We 're never apart . I just know something terrible has happened to him ! 11 minutes ! Tosh ! That 's the worst thing I 've ever heard . When I heard about this guy who had a spider lay babies in his ear and eat his brain . Oh ! Tears wo n't bring your friend back . Right now , time is our enemy . In the case of an abduction , every second counts . Listen to me . If we do n't find your friend soon , the chances are , you will never see him again . Oh , sorry . May I ? We 'll take your case . Now , can you give us a general physical description of the victim ? Victim ? ! Hey ! The clock ... it 's ticking . All right . High cheekbones , big expressive eyes , athletic build . Oh , no , wait ! That one 's me . This is Tosh . What 's his height ? About 9 12 inches tall . Weight ? Now , he 'll tell you he 's 34 of a pound , but between you , me , and the fencepost ... He 's at least a pound , but he carries it well . It 's gon na be ok . Believe me , I have a sixth sense about these things .

But just in case we do n't , we 'll go ahead and take the lamp now so it 's not awkward later , you know . - Ohh ! Lola , I ca n't talk right now . Oh , it 's no problem . Just wanted you to know that daffy and I are gon na be a little late . We 're investigating a missing person 's case . Mmhmm . But the good news is we got you a new lamp , and it looks exactly like your old one , except it 's a different color and the base is a little wider ... a lot wider . And the shade 's different . It 's a weird shade . Aah ! You know , you could at least see it before you judge it . Unbelievable , that guy . Tell me about it . Try living with him . Plus , I get the 10% friends and family discount here . Hey , guys ! I do n't have time to chitchat . Lola and I are in a race against the clock to save a life . One of the gophers is missing . That 's terrible . How long has he been gone ? - 15 . - Days ? Minutes . And every second I spend talking to you is a second I do n't have . Now , do you have a dollar ? I want to get something from the vending machine . Thanks . Put it on my tab . Minus 10% . Look , I know what you 're thinking . Daffy and I working side by side in an emotionally charged environment ? How easy it is for two people bonded by a shared experience to become romantically intertwined . I just want you to know that is not gon na happen with me and daffy . Yeah . I was n't worried . Ooh ! What about a reward ? Good idea ! But how do you put a dollar amount on a human life ? What am I talking about ? He 's a gopher . Put 5 bucks . All right , now , let 's put the photo of Tosh here . We do n't have a photo . What we also do n't have is time , Lola . That gopher 's been gone for 16 minutes . Maybe we should just give up and go home . You do n't mean that . And the spider 's still there , so , remember , you ca n't go home . You 're right . We do n't have a photo . We 'll have to draw a picture of him . Ooh ! Ok , not to brag , but I have been told I am a great artist . Oh , no , wait . I 've been told I 'm a great flautist . No , that does n't make sense . I do n't play the flaut . Ooh ! I 'll do it . Not to brag , but I 've been told I 'm a great artist . Yes , ok ... Shade that part ... How 's that ? I do n't know . Just those two big teeth in front ? He looks like a hillbilly . No offense . How about that ? Better . What about putting him in clothes ? You know , like , maybe a white outfit to signify his purity ? Ooh , yeah , like he 's the innocent victim . I like that . Hmm . Now it 's a little too much white . Maybe he needs a pop of color . Ooh ! That looks good . What about a hat ? Give him a little personality , like , " hey , look at me . I got a hat on . " Oh , yeah , that 's our guy . Let 's see what kind of spider we 're dealing with here . Uhh ! This kind of looks like him ... Murderer " ? " The venom of the six-eyed sand spider is highly toxic " and causes blood vessel leakage tissue destruction , and multi-organ breakdown " ? Aah ! Check out my n-new driving gloves . W-why are you so jumpy ? There 's a killer spider in the house . A kkiller spider ? You m-mean that one ? W-what do we do ? Just calm down . Let me get on your shoulders . II just had my jacket cleaned . Fine . Get on my shoulders . Oh ! You 're real solid , are n't you ? I ... Do n't know about this . You can do this , porky . Ddo we have to g-get so close ? It 's a spider . It 's not gon na jump on you . Aah ! It 's on my face ! - Kill it ! - But it 's on my face ! Stab it ! Get off me ! Porky , you 're panicking ! There 's a p-poisonous spider on my face ! Aaah ! Aaah ! Did he make it ? There 's only one way to find out : Dust for fingerprints . Right . Yes . Dust for fingerprints . You know what , we do n't need fingerprints . Let 's run some forensics . Right , forensics . Love forensics . Big fan of forensics . Now that I think about it , all we really need is a DNA sample . Right . One sample of DNA coming up . You want to just crawl inside and see if he 's in there ? Ooh ! Fun ! Nope ! No gopher . Ooh , but there 's tons of mail in here . Oh , really ? Hmm . Not as roomy as I thought it would be . Nnow what do we do ? Hey , boy ! You 're a good guard dog , right ? There 's an intruder in the house . You think you can get him ? Good boy ! Then go in there and get him ! Bye-bye . Wwell , it 's getting late . I 'll g-get my driving gloves some other time ! What do we know ? We know climbing inside a mailbox is against the law . What else ? The fire department 's not happy when they have to use the jaws of life to pry you out of a mailbox . What else ? The city says you have to pay to replace the mailbox or do 1,100 hours of community service . What else ? Tosh has been missing for 28 minutes and we still have n't found him . Oh , right , the gopher . I totally forgot about that whole situation . Well , I guess we 're back to square one . Or ... Uhhuh , uh-huh , interesting ... Maybe , could be ... Ahh ! I like where you 're going with this . I had n't thought of that . You 're good ! What do you think ? I think this is just the break we 've been looking for . Just do n't go back inside for 24 hours . You do n't want to breathe that stuff in . Oh , and thanks for the driving gloves ! Do n't mention it . Hi , Mr . bunny . Hey , gossamer , what 's the matter ? My pet ran away . Aw , I 'm sorry . His name 's Webster . He looks like an African sand spider , but he 's actually harmless . I really miss him . Can you please let me know if you see him ? Gossamer ! Look who I found . That 's not Webster . There he is ! Oh , I missed you so much , buddy . I thought those cookies would help us focus , but now I 'm just really full and tired and a little sick . Well , the gopher 's been gone an hour anyway . I think we should just assume the worst and get on with our lives . E-mail ? Text ? The beauty of today 's electronic devices is that they allow you to maintain a cool distance when delivering upsetting news . Ah ! Or maybe we do n't have to break the news after all . Come on ! Got ta keep that blood sugar up . Where are you , Tosh ? Oh , wait . That 's me . Where are you , Tosh ? We found your friend ! Where is he ? Tada ! I guess this case is closed . Oh , Tosh ! Where were you ? Why ? Whatever do you mean ? After I went to the mailbox , I spent an hour in the park . I thought it would be good to have a little time to myself , but the truth of the matter is , I hated every second of it ! Turns out , I did n't want time to myself . I just want to be with you . Well , why did n't you tell me ? You could have at least left a note . " Dear Mac , I 'm going to the park " to spend a little time alone . " I 'm sure I 'll hate it . Did n't want you to worry . Xoxoxo , Tosh . " You know what , I should go help bugs ... Kill that spider . Spiders can be pretty tricky . What , are you nuts ? Why were you handling a poisonous spider ?

Well , you do n't have to go home , but you ca n't stay here . Put this on twice a day . - What is it ? - Darvog . It 's an anti-inflammatory . Better than amputating !

I missed you so much ! Well , I missed you more . Oh , do n't be silly . I missed you more . All right , gopher ! Gim me my $5.00 ! I told you , I 'm not a gopher ! Aah ! Another spider ?

Keep going , keep going . All right , hold , hold . Good .  Hey , nice work , brother . Good stuff . Nice work , man . Nice stuff . Awesome job . Good job . Hey , nice job . You got a minute ? Yeah , sure . You ever throw a pot ? What ? You know , like , pottery on a wheel . No . Trudy and I took a class . That whole Ghost thing , very sensual . Anyway , you throw a pot , see , and it looks pretty good , but you only have a short while to make adjustments before it dries . Is it really the pot for you ? Maybe you 're looking for something rounder . You got to decide quick , before that pot dries and it 's yours forever . So you 're saying marriage is like a pot ? Yes . Yes . And nothing 's dried yet , Kelly . Do you follow what I 'm saying ? Mouch , you ever been married ? Not personally , no . All right , thanks , man . Psst , Lieutenant . How long you got ? How long I got to what ? Till this Severide marriage flames out . Otis , do n't be a dick . There it is . So , Lieutenant , why do n't you tell us a little more about this crazy wedding of yours , huh ? Start at the beginning . We want every detail . Who are you , my Aunt Ruth ? We said , " let 's get married , " we got married . When is she gon na be here already ? She 'll be here , all right ? She 'll be here . Do n't worry . Well , you got to admit , he 's happy . " She 's a graphic artist . We met at the craps table . Her name is Brittany , and she 's from Florida " ? You know what that adds up to ? Stripper . What do you have against Florida ? Are you seriously accepting all this as normal ? I mean , when has he ever high-fived anyone ? Let alone the entire house ? Gabby , he 's happy . Who has his ear ? Who can get through to him ? Shay . God , these calls are wiping me out . I need to get back into shape . Yeah , you 're looking like you 're in trouble . I 'm serious . Back at home when I was planning the wedding , I used to do spinning Mondays and Wednesdays , power yoga Tuesdays and Thursdays , and box-blaster on Fridays , and ... - Oh , box-blaster ? - It 's a kickboxing workout . Yeah , odd name . That 's really all I did . Working out and making sure dinner was ready by the time Harrison got home . You know , we got a heavy bag and some weights at the house , if you want to ... Oh , do you guys have zumba classes in Chicago ? I do not know what that is . Never mind . I 'll figure it out . Just curious . Ambulance 61 . Two-vehicle accident , corner of Jackson and Rose .  Thank God you 're here . Right this way . Let me take a look at that bump . - Were you hurt , sir ? - Nah , nah , it 's all good . Look , the only injury he has is the brain cells he killed with whatever he drank . No way , dude . Totally sober . I told the lady , let 's just exchange information . But I know the police do n't come to a minor accident unless you report an injury . That 's right , the police are on their way now . Just ... why do n't you go ahead and take a seat ? - All right . - Relax . What happened ? So I see the light 's red , and I come to a complete stop like good drivers are supposed to do . He ... Hey , hey , Sylvie . - He 's seizing . - Take that off . Oh , God . Could you ... - De-fib . - Charging . Oh , God , oh , God , oh , God , oh , God , oh , God ... - Clear . - Oh , God . -  - I got rhythm back . What does that mean ? Is he okay ? Ma'am , can you please just step back , give us some room ? - Thank you . - He 's still really tachy . Can we push midazolam ? I mean , I know it wo n't stop him from metabolizing the crack . Yeah , but it will ... it will slow down the seizing . Yeah , let 's do it .   Oh , look . He 's waking up . Ahh ! Guess he 's not metabolizing it anymore . - Hey , Mills . - Hey . How 's it going ? - It 's good , you ? -  Great . I just need you to stand by the car and wait while I go see someone . And that 's it , just stand by the car ? Yeah , that 's all . What the hell is going on with you , man ? Nothing ... it 's nothing , all right ? It 's like I told you ... it 's a little minor thing I need to straighten out . So can I count on you ? Yeah , sure . Thanks , buddy . Oh ...  Whoa , what happened here ? Oh , come on , admit it . You miss this . Yeah , yeah , the jealousy is just overwhelming . Hey , excuse me ? Hi , I 'm Brittany . I 'm , uh , I 'm looking for Kelly Severide . - I 'm his ... - Oh , you 're his wife . - Yeah . - You 're the roommate , right ? - Uh , sort of . Yeah , Kelly told me about you . Said you 're shaping up to be one hell of a firefighter . He said that ? Huh . Oh , sorry . This is Sylvie Brett . She 's one of the paramedics on Ambulance 61 . - This is Brittany ... - Baker . Or , uh , or Baker-Severide . We have n't quite worked that out yet . Uh , I 'd shake your hand but I 'm , uh ... it was a patient . I was n't out partying or anything . Obviously , I mean . We had an ingestion O.D . , which basically means a guy ate a whole bunch of crack , and it was ... suddenly I 'm realizing you do n't want to hear any of this . I 'm gon na go and shower now . But , you know , welcome . Congratulations and all . Thank you .  So , come on in . Guess who I found . All : Hey ! All right , welcome . What have you got here ? Well , I read an article that said when you come to a firehouse for the first time , come knocking with your elbows . What ? Because your arms are full of food . You know , most people overthink it . They get those fancy popovers and muffins with frosting ... Cream puffs . Now , I myself enjoy the occasional puff , - but en masse ... - They get soggy . Exactly . Oh , wow . Hi ! And who are you ? Who is this ? - Oh , that 's Pouch . - Well , hello . Hey ! That 's the official 51 seal of approval , right there . I am honored . So I 'm guessing you guys heard , " Vegas wedding , met at the craps table , " and thought ... - Stripper . - Hey , Capp , not cool . No , no , no , actually I do n't blame him . Well , this calls for a celebration . Friday night , Molly 's . Oh , yeah . Hell , yeah . Friday night at Molly 's . And I tell you what , 15% off all the drinks in honor of the happy couple here . This is so bizarre . - Hi . Brittany . - Hey . Hey , um , thanks for letting Brittany move in . We wo n't take long to find a place . Yeah , of course . Appreciate it .  She 's moving into our house ? Remind me to tell you that Brittany is moving in with us . What ... we do n't even know who she is . He does n't even know who she is . What , you think he married a serial killer ? Why are you so okay with this ? Severide 's a big boy . He can do what he wants . Look , however this plays out , good or bad , he 's gon na need me on his side . Hey , congratulations again . Thanks . And thanks for letting her crash for a while . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm better than okay . I 'm great . It just seems like ever since ... ever since Shay died , you 've been avoiding ... Why ca n't you just be happy that I 'm happy , Dawson ? Because I 'm not sure that you are happy . I think ... I think maybe that you 're hiding , and I know that Shay would n't want that for you . Yeah ? You think she 'd want you putting your wedding on hold forever ? No , that 's completely different . Look , some people , they get married when they know it 's right , however quick it is , and some people , they put it off . Maybe you 're doing what 's right for you and Matt . Just , before you accuse anyone of hiding ... check and make sure you 're not doing that yourself . You 're done ? Anybody can see the only way this goes is south , so I 'm out . Done . Why are you putting a tracker on this guy 's car ? You worry too much . Get in the car . - Mm-hmm . -  So ... I told my mom . And ? She cried . Like , good cried or bad cried ? Half " sad I was n't there " cry and half " happy at least my daughter is married " cry . We should fly her up . When we get our place . Like , have a little reception ? Yeah , just family . Yeah . Yeah , for family . Hey . Hey . Hi . So are we nuts ? Maybe . Hi . You 're new here , are n't you ? Oh , I 've taken a couple of zumba classes , but this is my first class here . Well , the instructor is awesome . You 're gon na love it . Row those arms !  We going this way . Hey , Tina , can you take over for a second ? Miss ? New girl ! Can I see you over here for a moment ? There you go , ladies ! - Whoo ! - Make it happen ! - Looking good ! - Yeah ! Who sent you ? - Nobody . - Who knows ? Nobody . You mean to tell me that you just came to a zumba class in Pilsen on your own ? I live here . Well , you 're just gon na have to leave , right now . But this is the best rated zumba class on Yelp . How you doing , ladies ? Well , what 's it gon na take to keep you quiet about this ? - Let me teach you to cook . - What ? You have a food truck that needs a cook . I have skills I have nowhere to use . - So ... - So cook for the house . But for Molly 's II ... Wait , hold on , let me get this straight . In order to keep you from outing me , I have to allow you to cook for me ? Yes . You are ... you 're like ... like , perfect . Deal ? Absolutely . All right , ladies ! One more time , yeah ! Oh , oh ! Here we go again , yeah ! - Pass the cheese ? - Mm-hmm . Thanks . Want some hot sauce ? Nah . There they are . Hey . - How 's it going ? - Good . Is that all you have ? Yeah , I came straight here with the bags I packed for Vegas . I 'm gon na get my friends to send me some more clothes . Otherwise , I 'm gon na be wearing a lot of bikinis . - Welcome . - Thank you so much ... so much for letting me stay here ... I like her . What ? When did this happen ? Like you said , he 's happy . What do I know ? You want a beer ? Sure .   I think ... I think part of me is a little jealous . I mean , he gets to do what he wants . Meet a girl , get married , put it all out there for the world . I just get tired of all the sneaking around and pretending . Have you been talking to Severide ? No , why ? Nothing , I just ... I mean , you know I hate it too , right ? I know . As long as you and I are both on 81 , what ... No , no , this is n't your fault . It is n't anyone 's fault . It just sucks . Yeah .  And sometimes I wish we could just fly off to Vegas and get the rest of our lives started . Got it right here . It 's got a little margarita spilled on it , but everything 's clear . Okay , we can make a copy of that . So these two are for your non-major benefits , prescriptions and the like . This one goes to personnel , and this one goes to the insurance company . Then these two are life insurance and pension forms , and they both go to the pension benefits department . Then for major medical ... you know what ? Let me get these filed for you . Really ? Consider it my wedding gift . Congratulations , Severide . May you know only happiness from this day forward . Hey , how many weeks you have us down for in the pool ? Three . We 're gon na prove you wrong , Chief . I hope you do . Thanks , Chief . Three , huh ? How many did you have ? - Yo . - Yeah . Come here for a second . All right . " I see you again , and you 're dead . " - Mills ... - Yo , this is happening at the house . If Boden finds out about this , - you are gone , and it 's ... - I hear you , man , come here . What the hell is it with you and this guy , man ? His name is Jake Williams . Okay , he has outstanding warrants for larceny and assault in Wisconsin . Okay , if I can tail or track this guy back across state line , I can pick him up and clear $2,000 . You are messing with this felon for 2 grand ? You have a daughter , come on . I have a daughter who has worked her ass off to help her team get to finals and a trip to D.C . that 's gon na cost me $1,500 . I ca n't let her down . House fire , 871 Carver Drive .  You have to get Andrew . Mr . Lewellen . - Is he the resident ? - Yes . He lives by himself with his dog , Paco . I saw him bring Paco out and then go into the cellar . - It 's right down here . - Ma'am , ma'am , go back . We have to find a new entrance . - Hey , Chief , got a window ! - Go ! Newhouse , Tony , I need ladder and entry ! Come on , hustle . Help him out ! Come on , hustle ! Newhouse , go through . Keep it back . Call out ! Call out ! Hey , chief , I found the resident . He 's pretty badly burned . Hey , bud !   Oh ! Hey , come on . All right , I 'm sending him up ! Severide ? Everything all right down there ? Negative . So , what do we got ? This fell out of the guy 's hands when he was being hauled up . I 'm pretty sure this is what he came down to get . Guy 's hand ? What guy 's hand , homeowner ? I do n't know if he owned the place , but I 'm pretty sure he owned the box . Where is he now ? My guess , halfway to Chicago Med . He was pretty banged up when they loaded him into the ambo . Hey , call dispatch , get a twenty on that ambulance . I want somebody with that guy when they roll into Chicago Med . So you did n't touch the box or its contents ? No . Did n't open it ? Pretty hard to do without touching it . We just have to ask these questions for chain of evidence , Kelly . I did n't open the box .  Those kids look pretty young . Hmm . Oh , God . Hey , Matt . There you go . What 's up ? We need to help out Newhouse .  What is that ? That is oven-fried ravioli with crispy sage and pancetta . You made those ? Hell , no , Brett did , but she 's showing me how , and it 's a perfect Molly 's II signature dish . Portable , delicious . It 's a lot like bar food . But with a sophistication all its own . It does n't smell half bad , I 'll give you that . And Brett 's got these things down to a science . We can knock these out in the truck to order , no problem . Okay . I 'm going in . Ladies and gentlemen , we have a new house chef ! Wait , what ? You think we 're gon na eat the swill these chuckleheads make when we have someone who can cook like this ? - Yeah . - All right . Brett , when 's dinner ? Oh , uh ... We would if it tasted like this . We need to keep Brett 's genius focused on Molly 's II . What 's wrong with you ? Just trust me on this one . Yeah , okay , Brett . No chow duty for you .  Put some money on here ! Give me your credit card . Yeah , you . Newhouse ! - Hey , you came ! - Hey ! Come here . Tell Naomi to have a great time in D.C . What 's this ? We passed the boot . - Are you serious ? - Yeah . Well , it was either that or have the guys eat 500 candy bars . This seemed like the better plan . Wow . Mills , this your doing ? God . I do n't know what to say . Thank you , all of you . Hey , we 're 51 . We take care of our family , man . 51 . Sorry .  It just hits me sometimes . I know . Me , too . No , no , your friends threw a party for us . - Let 's go inside . - You do n't have to . - You do n't have to . - I want to . You sure ? Sure I want to celebrate marrying you ? Yeah , yeah , so badly it 's not even funny . This is grim . Yeah . So the federal kiddie porn databases , they search for the kid and for the background so that they can identify the work of different offenders , so I figured we 'd do the same thing . Oh , my God . What ? Oh , my God . My God . When 's the last time you heard from him ? Ten years ? You know how old he is in that photo ? I mean , 15 , maybe . He took off for New York not long after that . Come here , come here . We 'll send that off to Manhattan SVU . Yeah . - Did you get the files I sent ? Um , yeah , thank you . Did I hear right ? You 've got history with one of the vics in the photos , um , a Ted Courtney ? Yeah ... He 's my brother . Erin , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . No , it 's ... it 's not . Well , listen , we got database hits on a couple of the other vics in the photos , all New York missings . I do n't know how your brother got mixed up in this , but we 're gon na get to the bottom of it , okay ? Listen , I 'd like to come and help out . I 've already cleared it with my boss , so if it 's all right with you ... I guess we 'll be seeing you soon . All right .  
@@5233241 I ca n't tell you how good it is to see you . - I 'll be honest , I thought you were dead . - Never felt better in my life . Oh , come on . That 's a lie . Look at you . - How 's Sylvie ? - Sylvie is dead . Fantastic . And the kids ? Denny , the last time we spoke you mentioned that despite astronomical odds you managed to become yet an even better lawyer . - Hard to believe , is n't it ? - I have a motion which I 'm quite capable of arguing myself being more talented than you . - No , you 're not . I also happen to be the client . The case is also extremely unconventional . I want to be frozen . - What do you mean ? - I wan na be frozen and stored in a cryonic institute . - What do you mean ? - I 'm 78 years old . It wo n't be long before my body starts to wither . I 've lived a full life . - What do you mean ? - I mean , when I leave this world I do n't want it to be forever . Which means , for now I wan na be frozen . What do you mean ? PAUL : So basically he wants to be euthanized . And preserved on ice . Evidently there 's some right-to-privacy law I 've never heard of . Why should you ? It 's in the Constitution . What 's Milton Bombay doing here ? He wants to be frozen and stored in a cryonics facility . - All in favor . - And he wants Denny to argue it . And what could possibly occasion him to want that ? The problem is the basis of the case if there is one , would lie in the Bill of Rights which Denny , of course , feels never should have been passed . We 're one Supreme Court appointment away from overturning . - The Bill of Rights ? - Damn right . I refer to Milton 's not yours . Any person who wants to be frozen should be referred to a therapist not a lawyer . Hey , pretty boy . I hear you 're looking for some interesting cases . Chelina Hall . We have n't officially met . Yes . I 've peeped at you in the girls ' room unofficially . Cute . Come with me . Stuart Milch , Alan Shore . A pleasure . Thanks again for agreeing to see me . Not at all . Especially since I 've made no such agreement . Show him the gizmo , Stuart . Tell him what it is , Stuart . It 's a news blocker . It 's sold off the Internet . You attach it to the input on your television and it basically blocks news transmissions . It 's true . My school principal attached these devices to all the televisions in the building . The problem is it turns out it only blocks one network . The most fair and balanced one . Which is a lot of hooey . This is blatant censorship . It furthers evidence of a liberal media , and I , for one , am sick of it . In all my years ... In all his years ... Milton , I consider you a friend . Actually , I do n't . I find you a bit boorish . But I have always enjoyed your unfettered candor . And in the spirit of that candor the case can not be won . Given that this is the only lifetime you 'll ever get to have please do n't waste what 's left of it in the cavernous sinkhole known as our system of jurisprudence . I made my life in that system . - I rose to the very top of the system . - No , you did n't . Milton , no judge is going to let you be euthanized and stashed in a subzero . - We can not know that unless we try , Shirley . I know you recently retired . I came in here in search of legal and intellectual acuity . And you sought out Denny ? I assure you , this is something I considered with all due gravity . I came to a decision . And now I appeal to you as my attorney to help me execute that decision . Do I make myself clear ? Perfectly . We 're talking about your execution . - Frozen ? - That 's why he 's here ? If there 's any legal research on point , which I doubt there is the sooner the better . You might look at assisted suicide or right-to-die . Brad , you take the math and science . You 're male and more innately qualified . Anything and everything you find on cryonics technology . Wait . This firm is actually going to help Milton Bombay be put on ice ? Come now , Lori . You of all should know it 's not so bad to go through life as a Popsicle . What is that supposed to mean ? Nothing . First of all , students have no vested rights whatsoever to watch any news during school . They are allowed to at Winslow High , except for one network . Ms . Tyler , is this particular broadcast being singled out on content ? If it is , Your Honor , schools have the right to legislate content . - Just as we search lockers . - Objection to the spin , judge . - This is a no-spin zone . - A principal is not subject to reasonableness in his policy . - This is the First Amendment in play . - What 's next ? Burning books ? JUDGE : Ms . Tyler I must say this has a bad stink to it . How do you ban one network news program and not the others ? The principal felt this particular network was detrimental . Well , I want to hear from the principal in this witness chair or I 'm going to grant the motion right now . WOMAN : There they are . - Mr . Bombay , why are you doing this ? It 's simply about wanting to continue my legacy for centuries to come . I 'm perhaps the greatest lawyer of all time . - I want that time to continue . - He 's not . Denny Crane . I 'm better . How are you , sweetie ? Still the king . Denny Crane . Mr . Bombay , you are asking for a court order to end your life . Under today 's science . - Tomorrow might be quite different . - But , sir , let 's be realistic . Why the hell do I have to be realistic ? It 's my body . What do I have to do ? Get pregnant ? Well , you may be couching this in pro-life terms but in today 's scientific world , being frozen makes you dead . I am asking for the chance to be alive in tomorrow 's world . To play with my  . Suppose one of them came into the court at , say , the age of 30 asking to be frozen ? - I 'd say , " Wait . - You 've got a lot of years . " - Well , maybe they would like it done before their body starts to go south . Which at 30 , it can . Look , I do n't advocate this for young , healthy people . But certainly if you can decide for yourself so should others , right ? - I 'm close to 80 . My life is almost over . Does one have to be old to get this autonomy ? How about somebody 35 with cancer ? If it was incurable , yes . Parkinson 's disease , MS ? What if somebody wanted to get frozen to avoid the draft ? Let him move to Canada . Freeze his balls off . Denny Crane . - Why did you do that ? - You were getting picked apart . - I was doing just fine . - You stepped on it . - Boys . We need to get back to the office and prepare our expert . - You stepped on it . - Did not . - Boys . - He did step ... WITNESS : Cryonics proponents do n't refer to the patient as dead . - Simply , " preserved . " - Frozen ? - Yes . - But , doctor if a person 's heart is n't beating , if there 's no brain activity we tend to call them dead . Under today 's medical definition , yes . The definition of cryonics is basically a process using very cold temperature to prevent people dying . - Where 'd we get this quack ? - Shh . Doctor , let 's be fair has anyone ever been brought back to life after being frozen ? No . And it 's not likely to happen soon . But the technology is changing . We 're discovering more about molecular nanotechnology . And one day it will be a reality . I do n't have time to explain . I just need you to go with it , okay ? I want you to count backwards from a 100 silently . - Why ? - I 'll explain later . It 's important . Ninety-nine , 98 .  Ninety-seven ... Okay , doctor . We 've heard that cryonics is in our future . But please , give me one example , one piece of evidence that indicates that this could possibly work . The wood frog . - I 'm sorry , did you say , " Wood frog " ? - Yes . A frog in the Arctic that hibernates and completely freezes in the winter . No heartbeat , no brain activity . It goes completely dead by today 's definition of death . Then in the spring , it wakens . Brain activity resumes , heart starts beating . - It 's alive again . - And you think if it 's possible for a frog ... Thank you , doctor . Humans are warm-blooded animals designed to stay at 98 degrees . Those frogs are cold-blooded with a completely different molecular structure . Admittedly , the future of cryonics involves molecular technology . - There is no evidence it can work with warm ... - There is . We have frozen rat livers thawed them and transplanted them . In Israel , they did it with hearts . In both cases , the rats lived , not for long . But the hearts and livers did come to life . - With humans , we 've frozen valves ... - You think freezing people is ethical ? - Is that consistent with ... ? - It 's ethical to freeze embryos . But again , I 'm up here to give you the science , not engage in a moral debate . Forty-four , 43 ... He kicked their ass . And the best part of it was he had integrity . Which is what you need in your expert . - How are we doing ? - The case would be Schiavo . It 's not first circuit . The Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal . We 'd argue it 's controlling . I wan na read it . Make a copy . You wan na read it ? Hell , no . Can I talk to you in private for a second , please ? I did n't want to embarrass you in front of your superiors but it seems to me the controlling case on this would be Cruzan . The whole thrust of Rehnquist 's opinion was autonomy : The patient 's right to decide . The opinion was muddled . It was essentially three-pronged : Autonomy , the patient 's best interest and the state 's interest to preserve life . You 'd win on prong one , but you 'd likely lose on prongs two and three . You 're much better off arguing Schiavo . - Mr . Bombay ? - Yes ? - Are you all right ? - Yes . I hated doing all the grunt work but there was all the promise of tomorrow . Would you have dinner with me tonight , Tara ? SHIRLEY : Milton ? Why do n't you have it with me . Why this one particular network ? PRINCIPAL : Look , all networks pander . Some to the liberal , some to the conservative . But when a news organization actually promotes a political agenda ... Can I dial you back a second ? How do they do that ? The broadcasts speak for themselves . Their CEO was the media operative for former Republican presidents . I object to his open mind , judge . - Move to strike ? - Sustained . And then when I saw the documentary Outfoxed it blew my mind . - Because ? It detailed the extent to which the media can go to promote conservative Republican causes . We 'd like to show you a brief series of clips from this documentary . They want news to be a matter of opinion . O'DONNELL : We were ordered from the top to carry propaganda carry Republican right-wing propaganda . It was made very clear to us that our activities were being monitored . If someone wasn ' t watching it live , they were recording it and they would review it after the fact to see what we did . PRINCIPAL : If you watch the documentary and I strongly suggest you do you 'll see that this goes on and on and on . And these accounts are from people on the inside . Okay . But to put a device on the television ? I hate the idea of shutting down free expression but this became more of a safety issue . - A safety issue ? - They 've got their talk show host declaring that anyone opposed to war is an enemy of the state , a traitor . We 're getting more fights . Kids are attacked for being unpatriotic . Arab and Muslim students being targeted . And the first order of the day is keep the kids safe . I thought the first order of an academic community was embracing diversity of opinion . Not when it 's a bias that fosters intolerance . Did you attach any little blockers to networks that lie about presidents and , say , the National Guard ? - I do n't dispute there 's a liberal bias . - You do n't censor those ? Those networks do n't foster intolerance . Any blockers for shock jocks ? Or is racism and misogyny not a concern ? - There 's a lot of garbage out there . - What about your own teachers ? - My teachers ? - A recent poll showed six out of seven college professors voted for John Kerry . Does that not suggest a bias in academia , Mr . Harper ? - Objection . - We 've got countless news programs too many talk shows to keep track of all kinds of opinions being spewed out over the airwaves . There 's many programs we do n't permit . - This is the only news show ? - They make a device to block out this particular network ? - It says censorship is popular . - That does n't make it right . - As principal , I have to make that call . And let me say this : I 'm a proud American . I got a flag on my porch . I pray for those troops every night . I taught some of those kids . They 're over there fighting for democracy which includes the right to question . For this network to be saying otherwise offends me as a citizen and principal . I see . So you 're squashing content to promote democracy ? Once again I will shut down any content that fosters intolerance . That is where I stand . You 're going to dinner with him ? I want to find out what 's going on . What 's going on is a runaway ego . It 's all about the spotlight . I know Mi ... I go way back with Milton . I know Milton like the back of my hand . He knows he 's gon na lose that motion . No risk of him being frozen . Meantime he 's all over the news . I 'm telling you , the man wants to be me . So I 'm gon na have a little talk with him . He 's gon na insist you go to Nicky Blair 's . Watch . - Sorry ? - He pays them to let him sing . - Pardon ? - He slips the maitre d ' a hundred bucks to come to the table and say , " Please , Mr . Bombay , sing us a song . " It 's all about the limelight with Milton . I promise you . CHELINA : What do you mean , lose ? We 're on the side of the First Amendment . The problem is school principals do have a wide discretion . Some networks are even censoring their scripted dramas . So , what do we go with if not freedom of expression ? ANCHOR  : Meanwhile , actor Vince Odoms you know him as the judge in the Michael Jackson reenactment trial has quit to play Phil Spector in the reenactment of that trial on a competing network . FBS president Rick Silverman is threatening to sue claiming the actor is under contract and it would be a material breach to walk in the middle of ongoing litigation . It was learned today that the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Office reportedly had ...  So , what 's the point ? - The point ? - Of us having dinner what 's the point ? If it 's sexual , I 'll need notice so I can take my little pill . You asked Tara . What was the point of that ? With her , I would n't need a pill . But when you were talking to Tara what I observed was a man looking backwards a man who perhaps is lonely . You 've got it wrong . I saw melancholy , Milton . And melancholy accompanied by the desire to be dead . Is this Milton Bombay looking to check out in a way that does n't tarnish his grand reputation ? Denny thinks you do n't want to win this case which would explain your hiring him . But you also hired me . You lost your wife , your job . Are you just giving up , Milton ? Let me tell you something . As science and medicine continue to evolve so must the law to keep pace . I 'm blazing the trail as a patient today so I can continue to set the standard as a lawyer tomorrow . - That 's what this is about . - Okay . The band and some patrons have requested that you grace us with a song . Tell them to vamp " She 's Making Eyes . And I also believe things even out . Given the hand I was dealt this time I could be in for some serious hardships the next go-around . And I do n't want that in my next life . I wan na be me all over again . Milton Bombay ! - Got it . MAN : Ladies and gentlemen , a treat . A special guest performance from that legendary barrister , Milton Bombay ! Thank you , thank you . Good to be here , folks . Here 's one of my favorites . I hope it 's one of yours too .   What do you mean you 're closing ? What happened to Shirley ? Milton , there 's a reason you came to me in the first place . In your gut , you know I 'm better than you . - Go with your gut . - I 'd sooner go with my intestine . I 'd prefer Shirley doing the closing . I 'm not doing it . - And neither are you . As I said from the start , the law does n't support us here . If we 're going to get a court order allowing you to die which would be the result , that judge is going to hear from you . - He did hear from me . - I do n't think so . If this is about you getting to perpetuate your legacy in the next century I 'm afraid you 're gon na have to make due with sustaining it in this one . You need to do better . And , Milton , for my money any guy who is asking to get stuck in a freezer is n't that desperate to live . Every major media watchdog group has labeled this news program as the most biased , right-wing news program on television . So what ? Political bias is rampant throughout the news business . - Including liberal bias . - We 're not talking about just a slant . Now , that may be good team spirit , but it 's disgraceful journalism . You talk about a democracy . What kind of principal censors free expression ? Your Honor , if I may ? Any principal has the right , if not the obligation to rail against bias , wherever . You saw that tape . - Which was also biased and self-serving . - Their most popular commentator threatens retribution against those who dissent . It almost rises to the level of hate speech . And if , in my view , it jeopardizes the welfare of the students I certainly have the authority to shut it down . Mr . Shore , this is a school . Is it wise to expose students to programs which send the message : " You 're anti-American if you question the government " ? Your Honor , before we convict them as the network of conservative values or any values , let 's remember , these are the folks who brought you Joe Billionaire and Who ' s Your Papa ? - That 's the entertainment division . This is n't about political content . This is a corporation looking to make money . They began as alternative news programming to grab a market share . They saw ratings and profit in a conservative demographic and they 've been waving the flag ever since . And so what ? News today , all of it , is infotainment . Last February , a deadly toxin known as ricin was found in the mailroom of the Senate majority leader . Headline News led with Janet Jackson 's exposed breast . A month ago , while we were in the middle of a war newscasts all across the country led with Prince Harry 's costume at a party . It 's a business . And while some news groups go with deeper social issues like Brad and Jennifer 's breakup the one here chooses to run with red , white and blue . Seventy percent . - Does that make it right ? - Of course it makes it right . Because the rule in infotainment is give the people what they want . This is money , Your Honor , not politics . Let me say , I am a great lover of the news . - I can see that . - I watch it all . On days like 911 , or for other world-changing events the news programs are nothing short of spectacular . When Martin Luther King delivered " I Have a Dream . " When President Kennedy was shot . When we walked on the moon . The Tet Offensive . Our lives are shaped by these events . In part , because of the news . But on all other days , they 're businesses looking to compete like anybody else in a highly competitive marketplace . They sell product . If anything needs a champion today , it 's the First Amendment . In a recent poll , half of today 's high school students thought newspapers should get government approval of stories before publishing them . The First Amendment has become an endangered species . And here we have a high school principal practicing censorship . My , my . We do have a problem . There is nothing in the law to support Mr . Bombay 's request that he be assisted in his quest to die . And that 's what this is : Assisted suicide . Now , we hear a lot of talk about personal autonomy . But there is a sanctity to life , Your Honor . A state has interest in that sanctity . If we erode that in any way well , we make the idea of suicide more acceptable . Perhaps more conceivable for the troubled teenager or depressed mother . You say suicide , in some situations , is an option ... - That was beautiful . Now , sit . At the risk of sounding immodest I am one of the greatest lawyers , possibly the greatest to grace the courtrooms of this commonwealth . And just the possibility of being able to still try cases in the 22nd century ... I have ALS . In a few months I 'll lose motor control control of my bowels . My brain will begin to ... And in a year or so , I 'll be dead . Legends should n't die like that . I do n't wan na die like that . Cryonics might not work . But 100 years ago , nobody was talking about cloning or the human genome . And 100 years from now , who knows what 's possible ? I truly , truly love life . And the chance to be living again seems preferable to eternal nothingness . When I fall , I want it to be in a forest . What the hell does that mean ? It means , I did n't want anybody to know . I do n't wan na be pitied . - All I want is to be ... - Denny Crane . Mine 's bigger . You know I 've always admired you , Milton . I 'm not dead yet . When is the judge gon na rule ? He said by tonight . I grew up watching Walter Cronkite . It was a time the news seemed to be fair , objective , trusted . In fact , whenever we doubted the blather it was the press we turned to to get a sense of the truth . Well , Walter Cronkite has definitely left the building . When it comes to credibility , big media is dead . Networks pander . Some to conservatives , others to liberals . This past election , you could turn to one channel to see President Bush ahead . Shore . It 's probably more about money than ideology . And being about money well , why should n't networks be free to adopt a bias in hopes of attracting a bigger audience ? This is America . Mr . Harper I realize times have changed in the high schools as well . Hate violence is on the rise . Administrators have to be freer to curtail student civil liberties including disruptive speech . But attaching a device to a television that blocks out a certain network because of the content that seems to go too far . It 's censorship , sir . And I ca n't let it stand . The motion for the plaintiff is granted . I do n't know what to say , Mr . Shore . You were incredibly brilliant . Yes . If there is any retribution at the school , let us know . Yeah , I will . Thank you both . Your country thanks you . My country thanks me . Yeah . This is where he gives his ruling . Thank you . But that is the law as it stands today . We live in a country that celebrates individual liberties and personal autonomy . But when it comes to controlling your own destiny this is a freedom that does not yet ring . I will pray for you but I can not grant you your request . Your motion is denied . God bless you . I 'm sorry . We can appeal . Next time , I 'll close . That 's all right , that 's all right . I 'm heading for Arizona . Try my luck with the courts down there . Milton no court is going to rule in your favor . MILTON : Even so , there 's a cryonics facility there . - Whenever the time comes ... - Do you know anybody in Arizona ? No , and that 's the point . Hey you live your way , Shirley , I 'll die mine . I 'm entitled to be remembered for ... Eh . Thank you both for your efforts . Milton . Milton . We go way back , you and I . Let 's not get carried away . We were worthy adversaries , occasional drinking buddies . But it 's not as if we had great affection for one another . Anyway ... We 'll see you , Milton . Oh . Yeah , see you . See you , Den ... Goodbye , my friend . Bye , goodbye . Bye . - Sorry . - Hey . People get old , get sick . Happens to everybody . How close were you ? It 's not that we went that deep . It 's we went ... Way back . You can be larger than life , just not death . - He went off to Arizona ? - Yeah . I really admired him more than ..... People should probably do that more , you know ? I care about you . I was n't fishing for that . I fish for steelhead , not mush . I care about you , Denny . You do n't have to say it back . Was n't planning to . NARRATOR : Next on Boston Legal : I 'm charged with engaging in sexual conduct for a fee . You paid a man to have sex with you ? - We plan to use a medical defense of ... - Nymphomania ? - An excuse offered by sex-perv sickos . - Yes . Thank you for that . - How 'd you like to go to Texas ? - Because ? The client is scheduled to be executed in 72 hours . He could be innocent . Subtitles by SDI Media Group

Just , uh , tweaked my system a little . Ladies and Gentlemen , the horses are on the track . The flag is up . They are all in line . And away they go . At the wire , it 's Buckey 's Folly by a nose ! - Why are you doing that right now ? - Did you know that primitive societies believed in using percussion as a means of communicating with the dead ? Are you drumming for someone in particular ? Yes . I 'm drumming for the corpse of my inspiration . And banging bongos worked for Richard Feynman , so ... Well , Feynman delighted in making music . I never percuss for pleasure . Actually , I may have before me a problem that can not be drummed away . Larry , why do n't you take a relaxing soak in the Jacuzzi ? No . Megan ? She 's ... She 's exciting , and she 's beautiful . And this thing that is between us , it 's beginning to affect my work . What is going on between you two ? I ... have not ... the slightest idea . Well , you never work well with emotional uncertainty . Do you think that 's it ? Do you think that emotional uncertainty lies at the heart of all this ? Really , I 'm not as familiar with that side of you . No , nor it seems , am I . No real witnesses . Broad daylight here , no one saw a thing ? Excuse us , folks . Excuse me . - Hey , Chuck . How you doing , buddy ? - Hey , Don . Well , apparently , the long shot was winning in a photo finish , - and everybody was focused on the race . - Uh-huh . - Come on , folks . - Found this on the body . - Something for Charlie , I guess . - Why 'd they call us ? - Call came from inside . There 's an agent from O-C already had an investigation underway . - Right . - Apparently , the track ownership had ties to an organized crime group . Hey , Agent Eppes . - Hey , nice to see you . - Yeah . What , uh ... ? - Liz . - Yeah . Liz Warner , right ? You guys know each other , huh ? Don was my Tactical Training Instructor up at Quantico . What , now , you 're heading your own O-C unit ? Whoa . See what a good teacher I am , Colby . Agent in charge took a leave of absence , so I was asked to keep the investigation up and running . All right , Agent-In-Charge , come here . What have you got ? Owner of the racetrack , Maurice Connors , likes to gamble . - Uh-huh . - Is n't very good at it . He 's a major player . His crew 's into credit card scams , - insurance fraud , and extortion . - Right . No . I know who he is . - What-What have they got going on here ? - Well , it 's a gambling scam , but we have n't put our finger on it yet . What , you think this kid 's connected ? We found that notebook with the body . From the looks of it , seems like this kid , Danny Roberts , may be helping Tabakian . I do n't know . Sounds a little thin to me . We also found some betting slips on the body . Past ten days , 90 races . This kid Danny Roberts made more than 30 bets . - Yeah . So ? - And won every single time . Explain to me why the drum has to be in my office . Because I had to clear my floor . They 're steaming the carpets in the Physics Department . - Hey . - Perfect . Hey . I ca n't get any dinner , but I need you to look at this for me . Would you ? - Just take a second . - Okay , sure . - Speaking of dinner ... - I know . I-I 'm sorry . I-I just ... I 've been so bogged down with ... Work ? Lawrence ? Come take a gander at this . It 's a category-based approach to ... I do n't know what , but it 's a forecasting system , right ? It 's very sophisticated . Oh , no , no , no . This is more than sophisticated . You know what this reminds me of ? A topos approach to Bach 's music . - I said , " very sophisticated . " - Yes , you did . - Where did this come from ? - It 's from a-a guy who was - murdered at a racetrack . - A racetrack ? Yeah , and we think he was using it to pick horses . Yeah , but if so , this whole approach is counterintuitive ... ? What ? But these equations are n't designed that way . How are they designed ? They 're designed to ignore the winner . Because he was n't picking the winner . He was picking the second place horse . Transcript : RaceMan Synchro : hanest Hey , why design a system to pick second place ? How does that system let you pick 30 straight winners in a row ? Does n't make sense . You know , if you 're gon na fix horse races on a regular basis , you have to pick horses that are at least contenders . Right , because if the long shot wins too many times , then , - I mean , it 's gon na look strange . - Right . So , - you have to pick a horse that could win . - Second . And then Tabakian would have to make sure that horse had help . I 'll go . I heard about what happened , so I let myself in . - When 's the last time you were here ? - I dropped off the mail yesterday . Can you tell if anything 's missing ? I do n't think so , but I ca n't tell really . - And you live downstairs ? - Mm-hmm . Any chance you might have heard something last night ? I took an Ambien before I went to bed . I 'm not much help , am I ? - You have any idea who this is ? - Oh , Danny 's girlfriend . She did something with computers , I think . - Danny was crazy about her . - Any idea where we might find her ? Well , they spent most of their time at her place down in San Pedro . - You had any lunch yet ? - Hmm ? - Is that a yes or a hmm ? - I 'm sorry . I just ca n't seem to crack the logic of this enabling argument . - All right , so take a break . - I 'll just ... I 'll make myself - a nice turkey sandwich later . - You sure ? - Mm-hmm . - These raspberries look delicious . I bought two baskets of them . Ever since that big thing on the news about antioxidants , you ca n't find a blueberry , these raspberries - - they 're so cheap . - What did you say ? - I said the raspberries are so cheap . - ' Cause everyone wants blueberries ? - And I thought you were n't interested . Um ... I got to check on something . I got to go find Don , so I 'm gon na be home later for dinner . Okay . But I 'm going out for dinner . So I , uh , did a tour in Washington . - Good for the resume . I mean , if I recall , you had a a bit of an issue with adrenaline , right ? I like to think it 's more of a hobby than an issue . Uh-huh . Now , how 'd you stumble onto this case ? Well , we were running a surveillance on a midlevel supplier linked to a Salvadorian drug cartel . He liked coming to the track , so we came with him . What ? That 's where you found Tabakian ? Yeah , we 're thinking the drugs and him ca n't be a coincidence , but so far , we 've never seen any product at the track . Now , just tell me if this owner guy ... is he cooperating ? - Maurice Connors ? No . - Oh ? Track 's a cash cow , so , long as it is , he figures Tabakian 's just gon na keep him around . - Hey . - Howdy . You know , we could shake things up for him with Tabakian . So that 's him . How you wan na play this ? Uh , well , you lead . I 'll shake . Mr . Connors , FBI . We 'd like to talk to you about what happened yesterday . I do n't know anything about it . You do n't know anything about a murder at your racetrack ? Well , I 'm aware of what happened , but I did n't know the kid . Really ? ' Cause according to some of your tellers , he was a regular . We have a lot of regulars . Yeah , how many of them are stabbed during the races ? You 're suggesting his death had something to do with my racetrack ? I do n't know , maybe with the track 's new management ? - New management ? - Yeah , Ivan Tabakian . - You know anything about him ? - I do n't think I should answer - any more questions . - You have n't answered any yet . Eppes . You know , does n't really matter if you answer our questions . ' Cause all Tabakian 's gon na hear is that you were talking to the FBI . Thanks for all your help , Mr . Connors . We 'll be seeing you . Got the dump on Danny Roberts 's phone . - Anything good ? - Yeah , past month , he 's only called two numbers regularly ; one is a San Pedro exchange , probably his girlfriend . - Yeah ? Did you get her name ? - And an address . Plug that in to your fancy little nav system in your Acura . Oh , do n't play ... - What about the other one ? - It 's an off-track betting place . Palomar OTB . That sounds good . What 'd they say ? I did n't call them . Did n't really seem important . That was almost funny , Granger . - Come on , what did they say ? - Transferred me over to legal affairs . Let 's go see the girlfriend . So I think I know why Danny Roberts was focused on picking second place finishers . He designed a system that identifies arbitrage opportunities . - What does that mean ? - It means he was looking for bargains . Bargains ? - Racetrack use pari-mutuel betting systems where market forces determine the odds . It was actually invented by a French perfume maker , uh , in the 1800s ... - All right , Charlie , just ... - Okay . In pari-mutuel betting , the odds fluctuate according to how much is wagered on a horse . So it 's like kind of like an auction where the more people there are that want to buy something , - the more expensive it becomes . - And sold ! In horse-racing , more expensive translates to lower odds . So , the lower the odds , the smaller the return on the bet . So the favorite is just a horse with the most amount of money bet ? That 's exactly it . - But we 're dealing with a horse here that no one 's really pang attention to , so ... And it can also be a highly inefficient market . That inefficiency creates a situation where the potential for reward outweighs the risk . And those are the opportunities that Roberts was betting on . But that still does n't explain how Roberts won 30 straight bets , right ? No , you 're right , it does n't . I mean , something must 've changed , you know , whether it was in his system , or at the track . - Right , enough to get him killed . - And in order to determine that , I need data on those races so I can compare his system to the most recent results . - How recent ? - Just , like , you know , the races in the past ... year . Yeah , welcome to my world . I write software for an IT company ... Can you think of anybody who might 've wanted to hurt him ? No . I 'm sorry . How about if I give the whole " just us girls " thing a try ? All right . I 'll call the office , check on the status of the subpoena for the OTB . Good luck . T hanks . - Had you guys set a date yet ? - Next spring . We were kind of an odd pair . Danny was outgoing , and I was ... more the geek . Hmm . I got something similar going on myself . I just do n't understand how this could have happened . Do you know if Danny had ... an argument with someone at the track ? He did n't even talk to anybody at the track . He was too focused on working his system . 30 bets this week . So maybe this Danny Roberts kid was keeping the girlfriend in the dark . She was totally surprised about the winnings . I do n't know . Would n't be the first time a guy tried to hide money from his girl . I 'm with you , but the way the landlady spoke about them , young couple in love , it 's not really adding up . This thing is n't adding up in a big way . Turns out he was hiding more than just 30 bets from her . That 's the results of the subpoena from Danny Roberts 's account at Palomar OTB . He set up the account a couple weeks ago and he placed one bet . - What , Pick-Six ? - Yeah . What is a Pick-Six ? You have to pick the winner in six straight races . It 's basically like winning the lottery , and he just did it five days ago . - Yeah , what did he get ? - Half a mil . Or not . I just talked to them . They told me that he never cashed the ticket . So you know Don pretty well , huh ? You know what Quantico 's like . Yeah , I bet he was a pretty tough instructor , huh ? He was just back from the field . - Fugitive hunting ? - Yeah . And still getting used to being back in civilization . Any reason you 're asking ? I just screwed something up a while back . Well , I can tell you this much . Fact you 're still here , means something . But I would n't count on being forgiven twice . So , Danny Roberts picks six winners for half a million dollars , but does n't cash the ticket ? Just does n't make any sense . Girlfriend said he was borrowing rent money . Sounds like he was hiding the winnings from someone . - Yeah , bet , too , maybe . - The tellers all knew him . So maybe he was n't working for Tabakian ? Which might explain why he 's dead right now . - Six winners . - Six consecutive winners . - A streak of 30 wins . - All from a system designed to - pick a second place horse ? - Does it make sense ? No . In theory , it should never have happened . Hey , you guys . What are you two up to now ? We have been dealt a paradox of theory versus praxis . Is that bad ? Well , we 're attempting to decipher a betting system that 's achieved something that it just was n't designed to do . And currently , we stand at the abyss , having reached the limits of our knowledge of the sport of Kings . - Oh , racetrack . Yeah , well , I ... I got hooked when I was a kid . I-I knew nothing about this . Well , like I said , it was before I met your mother . I take it Margaret was not a fan of the horses . Uh , no , she was a big fan of college funds . Hmm . Hey , by the way , uh if we leave right now , we can make it to the track for , uh , morning workouts . - Yeah , great . Larry ? - No . Count me out . Now horses going around a track , it all puts me in mind of an acute childhood trauma . - Really ? What happened ? - I was nine . I was with my parents at a county fair , and I saw a man get crushed . Wow . By a horse ? Horses , actually . Yeah , it was a merry-go-round . - Let 's go , Dad . - Yeah , coming . - Hey . Roberts bounced a check here and there , but there 's no reason for him to hide money from a creditor . Yeah , well , let 's see what Charlie comes up with . Back at Quantico , you never really talked about your brother . No ? As I recall , you never really talked about yourself with anyone . - Thanks . - Well ... I was n't in a really good way back then . Well , I hear you may be mellowing with age . Well , let 's hope so , right ? I 've just heard some things about you and a certain federal prosecutor . Oh , yeah , did you ? Don Eppes with the same woman for more than a week . I do n't know , some might call it progress ... why does he get whacked ? You know , we had a witness , a trainer . He 'd been doping horses . Injecting an antidiuretic - so a horse would retain water , - Uh-huh . carry excess weight . He was all set to testify for the grand jury . But what , Tabakian found out ? He had the guy 's hands nailed to a stall , brought a horse in and had the guy kicked to death . Pff . Nice . So Danny Roberts 's system was designed to pick the second place horse . Why ? Because there 's a bias in the betting on second place . I mean , if you know what you 're doing , you can exploit that . - Now how do you know ? - Railbird , remember ? It took me half a day to work that out mathematically . Well , you should 've come to me sooner . Yeah . So , handicapping . We 're trying to predict how a horse will run at the distance of the current race . See , I 'd even take it a few steps further . I would . I 'd factor an average race speed , interval pace , wind speed , - time of day , assigned weights , - Oh , Charlie . - gate slot , sun position ... - Charlie ... - Charlie , you ca n't account for everything . - You can , - if you can think of everything . - Ah . But this is what 's confusing here . Look . It 's a probability adjustment describing a dynamic system with hidden states . Charlie . Railbird . Railbird . It 's just something that 's not readily apparent to other bettors . Look , in my experience , handicappers know practically everything . That is , unless you want to take cheating into consideration . - Well , that 's just it , is n't it ? - What ? Cheating is the behavior that Roberts designed his algorithm for . - Who are you calling ? - Your brother . Thanks . - Oh , hey , Megan . - May I come in ? Uh , yeah , yeah , uh ... um ... Just , um ... - It 's a little unexpected . - I know . I 'm sorry . I really should have , um , called . I just was n't really sure I was coming here until I was already , um ... - here . - I-It's-- Yeah , that 's fine . And ... Don said that Charlie and Alan went to the track . You did n't go with ? No , no , no , no . Gambling on animals . That 's a messy business . No , no , I much prefer cards . In there you have an appreciable structure , you know , played out in a graded tensor product space , so ... Sounds like structure is pretty important to you . I 'm sensing a-a more than casual inquiry . Well , I think what 's been going on between us is pretty unstructured . - Oh , I 'm sorry . I-It 's an asymmetry between matter and anti-matter , which emerged shortly after the Big Bang . It 's - - Yeah , it 's baryogenesis . I think I 'm finding that , that things between us are maybe just , I do n't know , um ... just kind of a trifle free-form . I 'm guessing that 's why you have n't called in a while . Well , you see , Megan , I-I 'm just finding this whole journey from I to us - - it 's just a little more distracting than I originally anticipated . And I would have guessed that a guy that lives in his car would n't need that much structure . There 's few things better organized than a 1931 Ford . Listen , I 'm not , um , making any demands . No , and I 'm not suggesting that you are . But if you need a little more structure , I 'm not necessarily opposed to that . Okay . Yeah , let me just check my planner . I 'll see you this weekend . Yeah , it looks - - it looks clear . So originally , Roberts designed his system to pick second place finishers , - and then something changed . - Yeah , cheating . It was my idea . - Mm-hmm . - Right , a-and suddenly , the horses that should be winning stopped winning , and that screws up his ability to pick the runner-up . So then he makes an adjustment because , well , he realizes that the outcomes are consistently falling outside the range of realistic probabilities . It 's like a weather report . For the forecast calls for a heat wave , than instead there 's a freak snowstorm . You know , once or twice , that 's anomalous . You ca n't predict anything perfectly , but if that pattern is persistent , you 've got to assume that there are unknown factors to consider . 30 straight winners . - So it proves it was a scam . - Yeah . Maybe it was the cheating that got the guy killed . Yeah , he may be right . I loaded all the race data onto my laptop , so I was able to run every Pick-Six winner for the past six months through Roberts ' algorithm . - And ? - A snowstorm in July . Right , at least for the past few months . I mean , five winners . Each of them won the Pick-Six when the races were fixed . That 's just not a coincidence . Granger . Hey , we got something from Charlie . I tried to give you a call . Yeah , I got your message . I was at Cal Sci . Ah , Larry . - You 're dying to ask , are n't you ? - No . - I think it 's the unpredictability . - I did n't ask . All right , you did n't ask ... Exactly . What do you see ? Celia Martinez ' bank account . She 's one of the Pick-Six winners Charlie linked to the cheating . - Yeah . - The last transaction is to an Estate Trust . I think Celia Martinez is dead . - What are you doing ? - Just checking something . Social Security numbers of the other Pick-Six winners . Yeah . Wharton is dead ? Look at this . They 're all dead . So , you got two overdoses , a fatal hit-and-run ... And the other two deaths were caused by drowning and a fall . So all five deaths were accidental ? What are the odds of that ? About the same as all five winning the Pick-Six . All right , so let 's look at ' em as homicides . Right ? All right , I 'll get into it with the Medical Examiner . Tabakian 's got to be behind this . Well , then , we just connect him to the money . Or we just go pick him up . Are we tip our hand early , we only add to the body count . Thanks again for the use of the tub , Alan . I 'd say anytime , but you might think I meant it . No , no , I promise I wo n't make it a habit . I was kidding , Larry . You know you 're always welcome . Anytime . Thanks . By the way , if you get tired of that nomadic lifestyle of yours , I , um , I do happen to have some , uh , brochures of a condo development . They 're really great properties . While back , I was thinking of taking one myself . It 's so funny you 're even mentioning this . All right . How so ? Because lately , I have been rethinking some of my earlier assumptions with regards to , - you know , pure intellectual endeavor . - Ah . - Hmm . - Plus ... my car . No backseat . Let me get you one of those brochures . All five victims cleared out their accounts with a cashier 's check . The checks were cashed at banks overseas in Azerbaijan and Armenia . Ugh , so I 'm guessing the accounts went nowhere ? Ah , the money is a dead end . We have five victims from five different neighborhoods and five different ethnicities . There 's no common denominator . Except Tabakian . He found them ; we just got to figure out how . Maybe it 's an employment thing , a work connection . Raymond Wharton did n't even have a job . Neither did Celia Martinez . That 's it , the unemployment office . It 's two blocks away . It 's quicker to walk ... - Larry . - Yeah . How much did you hear of what I just said ? You do n't have enough data to connect the people to your mob boss . - Exactly . - Yeah . So concentrate on the data you do have and maybe there 's a way to connect them through their bets . Larry , that 's ... brilliant . What is it with me and structure ? Do you find me overly structured ? I do n't kn - - Why are you asking me ? Just humor me here , just answer this question . Well , on the one hand , you do n't have a home ; and on the other , you eat monochromatically . Look , do you remember when I was an undergraduate in your quantum physics class ? Yes , how could I ever forget ? That class was the first place that I learned about the paradoxes between quantum mechanics and general relativity . And I think Megan could very well be ... your own ... private gravity . I have records for all five of them , but they all went to different job centers . Can you access that information from here ? Sure . Everything 's linked . I can pull up a list of companies that each of them interviewed with . Wait , can you scroll back up for a second ? - Do you see something ? - Yeah . Take a look at this . They all interviewed at the racetrack ? - Can you see who they talked to there ? - Uh , that sort of thing would only be in the original files . So , let 's look at the original files . It takes five business days to process a request . - Hey , all right , so ... - Where you been ? Wait , wait . Hold on , hold on , we got here as fast as we could . - Just relax . " I said , " Use other data ? " - I-I reworked the algorithm , you know . - Shh . Just slow down , just slow down . I made improvements to Roberts ' algorithm . I took a look at all the racing results for the past two years , and you know , not just the Pick-Six . I looked at all the betting . - And ? - They were fixing races way before they fixed the Pick-Six . - What do you mean ? - They started by fixing races , like , once a month . Then twice a month , then more frequently . Look , there is a regular progression to this pattern . Charlie , we already know they were fixing races . Right , but now , now we know when they were doing it ... - 18 ... other murders . Charlie , that 's a lot of bodies . I mean , look , we 'd know if these guys killed that many people . Well , not if they staged the deaths as accidents . So look at this . Here 's another one . Not deceased . I 'm starting to think we 're not looking at more bodies . - All right , so what is it ? - I mean , first of all , we 're not looking at 18 different people . We 're looking at six guys who won a lot of bets over the course of the 18 dates that Charlie gave us . Six guys . And they all have to be connected to Tabakian . All right , look , why do n't you just start checking into their backgrounds ? All right . - Give up on the water cure ? - Yeah , it was n't really working . - Plus , I ran out of hot water . - Oh . - Thank you . - You all right ? - Yeah , it 's just the efforts I 've made to simplify my life have started to complicate it . You know , not long ago , I was , um , I was worried about Charlie , you know . About him having a normal life . That 's a bit of a challenge , given the circumstances of his genius . Yeah , that 's what I realized . So I thought maybe , uh , normal for him was not on target . And ... perhaps for you , simple is off the mark . - I 've never known life to be simple . - Larry ? - Yeah , in here . - Hey , I need you to look at something . - Why are you both in here ? - Okay , what is it I 'm looking at ? That 's my question . Look closely ... it looks like a blue book that one of my teaching assistants has graded . - That 's exactly what I thought . - Oh , yeah , one of those things you guys give your students to do exams in , right ? I think someone was helping Danny Roberts . I think someone was checking and improving his work . - So he had an accomplice . - Who was talented at math . So , according to Charlie , Roberts was getting help on his system . Yeah , now , if Danny Roberts had an accomplice , that means somebody else knows about the cheating at the track . Which means we still have a witness out there . No , his girlfriend told Megan that he worked at the track alone . So maybe whoever helped him was n't at the track . We got the full records from Unemployment . Maurice Connors ' name is all over their interview cards . Wait , what happened to the five business days ? I let her hold my gun . That 's a subpoena . Every single one of the Pick-Six victims , they went into the track looking for work , Connors must have directed them straight to Tabakian . - Wow , that 's accessory to murder . - Yeah , to say the least . All right , good . Hey , did you get anything on the guys who won the bets on fixed races ? Yeah , three of them had sheets , mostly drug related . Ooh . Mind if I have a look ? Yeah , I 'll show you the files . They 're on the desk . I 'll get to run , - but you can take a look . - Thanks . - You have no cause to arrest my client . You know these people , right ? - Go ahead , take a good look now . - Do n't answer that . - You interviewed them for jobs . - I interview a lot of people . How many get murdered after winning the Pick Six ? Maurice , I 'm ordering you not to respond . You 're ordering him ? Who 's the client here ? Look , I got your name signed on the interview cards . All right ? That 's one , two , three , four , five . - I had nothing to do with this . - Mr . Connors , it 's gon na take a jury about ten minutes to decide otherwise . - Maurice , you need to keep quiet . - No , you need to keep quiet . Let 's go . We 're done here . You have no right to interfere with the representation of my client . Your client . Who 's paying your bills , counselor ? Go ahead , ask him who 's paying his bills ? Boyd ? Maurice , do n't make a mistake . I did n't kill anybody . I 'm afraid I can no longer represent you . One guess who his first call 's gon na be . Tabakian told me to keep an eye out for single people , no families . People who could work the late shift at his club . - Why ? - He told me he was expanding his business into drug trafficking . He figured out a way to clean their money . All right . Mr . Connors , you just hang tight for two minutes . You remember I told you I followed a drug supplier to the track ? - Yeah , the Salvadorians . - Yeah . Turns out the supplier 's name was on Colby 's list of people who won money on the fixed races . Hey , what , they bet with the dirty money , then he washes it . They even paid their taxes . Danny Roberts must have just stumbled into this . Yeah , along with the girlfriend . Megan and Colby are on their way to San Pedro and bringing her in right now . All right , good . Sharrlyn ? It 's Agent Reeves . It 's clear . Granger . Look at this . That 's blood spatter . Looks like Tabakian got here before us . So the locals are running a neighborhood canvas , but so far , nothing . What ? They carried a girl 's body out of here in broad daylight . Yeah , we 're trying to track down deliveries or mailmen , anybody who might have seen something . Sharrlyn Smith has a master 's degree in Math from Stanford University . So she was definitely Danny Roberts ' accomplice . Great . Which means I just lost another witness . Yeah ? All right . We got to go . A hit ? - That half-million dollar ticket , it just got cashed . Someone transferred all the money to an off-shore account . Our techs traced it to an IP address inside this hotel . Tabakian 's crew probably found the log-in IDs when they tossed the girlfriend 's apartment . So they killed our only witness , and they cashed the ticket . Why leave a half mil on the table if you do n't have to ? Let me get those keys . Thank you . - FBI ! - FBI ! You 're supposed to be dead . Danny asked if I 'd look at his system . It just ... it was n't working anymore . And that 's how you realized they were fixing the races ? The only way to explain the results was cheating . So I wrote an algorithm that included a proviso for it . That 's how Danny picked 30 winners in a row . - I did n't know that he was doing that . - You had the Pick-Six ticket . But the Pick-Six ticket ... it would be enough for us to start a life together . If I 'd never worked on his system , Danny would n't be dead . Why did you fake your death ? They came to my house . I hid in my car . I waited all day for them to leave . And when I saw what they did , I panicked . I figured if everybody thought I was dead ... Sharrlyn ... your algorithm gives us a wedge into a major narcotics ring . But Tabakian and his guys are not gon na stop looking for you until they ... know you 're not a threat to them . - So what am I supposed to do ? - You help us , and we protect you . Agent Reeves , they killed Danny in broad daylight , in front of a crowd of people . I know . And I 'm not gon na let that happen to you . But you have to help me . Yeah , I know , it can wear thin , right ? Ivan Tabakian , FBI . I 've got a warrant for your arrest . Let 's go , get up . Let 's go ! Get up . I 'm eating my fish . A nice sea bass . Perhaps this can wait ? Hey ! Was I talking to you ? ! Huh ? ! Was n't talking to you , either . Get up ! - All right . I know the drill . - Uh-huh . This time , we got a witness you ca n't touch . Let 's go . Maybe it 's just my own history speaking , but I 'd like to think that Antoine grows up to be a cop . What ? A cop ? Did you and I just see the same movie ? Well , you never know how things turn out . So go over the schedule with me one more time . Okay , dinner and a movie every other Friday , lunch on Thursdays . No , Wednesdays . - And I get a wild card once a month . - That 's it , that 's it . To use at your own discretion . And what do we call this ? Oh ... how about structured complexity . You know , I 'm thinking of using my wildcard . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Maybe for breakfast tomorrow . Okay . Transcript : RaceMan Synchro : hanest 
@@5234041 Previously on Eureka ... S.A.R.A.H . , you infected Andy with some kind of emotional ... I did n't infect him , I improved him . Andy , I really like you . Wow . Our goal for this selection process has been to find the best of the best in Eureka . What we really want to know is , why space ? What , or who inspired you to pursue it ? They 've made their final selections for the Astraeus mission , and she wants me to inform the candidates . You did n't make it , Jo . I know . I withdrew my name from consideration . You what ? No , we did this together . We should be going together . But space is n't my dream . Did you ? Yeah . Did you ? We made it ! Congratulations , Dr . Marten . - You earned it . - Thank you , Isaac . Your selection is merely another example of bureaucracy rewarding mediocrity . My condolences to Titan . Whoa . Morning , S.A.R.A.H . S.A.R.A.H . ? Morning . Oh , so you 'll be with Zane . Well , he 's been , uh , giving me the stink-eye since I pulled my name out of contention . Does he think you made a mistake ? Did you ? No . I was in it for the wrong reasons . I ... I ... I do n't need to go to Titan . Because you 're happy here . - Yes . - Ah . I 'm happy here . S.A.R.A.H . , can I have some coffee , too , please ? Well , she ca n't be busy . Morning , folks . - Oh . - Yes , she can . Good morning , sheriff Carter , Ms . Lupo . Is n't it a beautiful day ? Uh , yeah . Andy , uh , this is the , uh , third day this week that you 've slept over , yeah ? Neither S.A.R.A.H . nor I actually require sleep . Blake ? Uh , no . ' Cause we 're human , and it 's my house . Oh . Okay . Well , I guess I better get ready for work , then . - I ... - That was n't very nice . Well , come on . It 's not like the toaster has guys sleep over . S.A.R.A.H . , what was that ? Sheriff Carter 's breakfast accidentally fell into the garbage disposal . Oh ! Very mature ! Ms . Lupo , would you please tell sheriff Carter that I 'm receiving a call for police assistance at Dr . Welke 's farm ? I 've got ears , S.A.R.A.H . , I 'm right here . Dr . Welke 's part of the Astraeus crew . Did he , uh , did he mention what happened ? He 's reporting that Lenore has liquefied . Excuse me ? Well , no more cowbell . Huh ? We 're sending cows to space ? She 's just a host until I pack my scabies for the trip . I 'm an acarologist . Uh , Dr . Welke studies cow mites . But I ca n't test the hardiness of xylene-treated acari in a nitrogen-methane environment now , can I ? All clear . Taggart ? Back in town ? I 'm Astraeus ground supervisor for bio-organic experiments . Been gathering up projects from around the world . Oh . Just brought in a shipment yesterday . - Jackie ! - Ah ! Yo , ho ho ! Jo , sweetheart , well , it 's great to see you . Though I wish it were under happier circumstances . Yeah , uh , any idea what happened ? Do n't know ... never seen cellular breakdown like this in a vertebrate . Well , is there any chance maybe you brought a little germ hitchhiker with you - from another project ? - Well , possibly . Sure . Could you take this to Allison for analysis ? Yeah , nothing says , " good morning , " like a jar of ... cow . Hey ! Did ... Jo Did you , um ... Have you talked to him ? Since 1947 ? Since everything 's changed ? No . Any idea if you were involved ? No clue . What the hell is this ? Oh , well , must be , uh , critters in the rafters . Oh , you think ? Farms are gross . So ... any luck ? Nah , I 'm ... I 'm set to 1db per division , but , um , still ... no signal . Well , it 's a billion miles away , so nailing the frequency will take some time . But we do n't have much time . I mean , I know it 's only a temporary camera , but the whole idea of FTL-ing the comm-system in advance was to establish a link before you get to Titan with the crew . - You mean ... I knew you were being considered , but oh , my God ! Well , it 's official . Senator Wen just called . It 's crazy , right ? Well , she could n't have found a more qualified person , captain Monroe . Thank you , ground commander Deacon . Oh ! Excuse me . Cargo unit B-17 's at capacity . Should we move it onto a launch pad ? - Yes . - No . Ah ... We 're still on the ground , ground commander . Whatever works for you . Well , I will inspect the unit first , and then you can move it . Yes , sir . - We 'll figure this out . - Mm-hmm . Well , hey ! Coming to you live from the surface of Titan . Want to play doctor ? Hmm ? What ? Jack . That 's virtual harassment . Oh , I ... I had a dream that went sort of like this . Aw ! No , she was ... It 's a VR communication prototype for Astraeus . I hated sleepaway camp . But this should help the crew feel more bonded with home , if I can get it to work for more than a few minutes at a time . I like our solution ... Which is staying together . What is that ? Oh , um , I 'll give you a hint . What 's , uh , black and white and dead all over ? Astraeus astronauts , please report to hangar " A " for official crew photo . All 20 members , please report ... Sorry , Parrish , official crew portrait . No alternates . Uh , we 're still officially members of the mission . - Whatever you say . - Doug . First alternate is still an amazing achievement . It 's like ... - You 're almost a winner . - Almost . This is n't over . Until that ship launches ... I still have a shot . Okay , people ! Group photo ! So ... Zane , I was kidding . Yeah . Well , we take this mission very seriously . So , uh , captain , huh ? Congratulations . I guess that means you 'll be the first . Uh , the first what ? The first person to set foot on Titan . Oh , well , that ... That honor has n't been determined yet . Well , in that case , I 'd like to put my best foot forward . I am the head of G.D . You 're playing the head-of - G.D . card ? It seems to me that the first person should be a woman . You 're playing the girl card ? You guys got the moon . We should get Titan . - It 's Even-Steven . - Okay , um , I know we 're all really excited . But right now , we need to focus on the launch . So , let 's get to work . Briefing in ten . Okay . Well , I see why she 's the captain . Oh , yeah . Ignition sequence activated . - Henry , shut it down . - It wo n't deactivate . - Ignition activated . - Everybody out ! - Get out ! Everybody out ! - Five ... - Come on , let 's go ! - Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... Boss , get out of the way ! Jack ? You okay ? Yeah ! Where 's Andy ? - Hello-o-o ! Unh . Hey , guys ! Look at me ! Huh ? I 'm on Titan . There 's our stuff . Ha ha ha ! Andy , you okay ? Doin ' great , Dr . Deacon . Little chilly , though . I can feel my joint lubricant thickening . Do n't worry , Andy , we 'll figure this out and get you home . Hold on a minute . It 's 290 degrees below 0 on Titan . There 's no way he can tolerate that for very long . Six hours . - Less , may ... maybe . Okay , I will get Zane and Fargo started . Good . I 'll run some diagnostics - and reset the FTL . - Okay . Well , there 's some tenderness over the bone . Probably just have some bruising . - You were lucky . - Oh , thanks to Andy , yeah . How 's he holding up ? Uh , first off , we 're trying to get him home , but he 'll be fine . Jack , he 's a billion miles away , freezing and breathing corrosive chemicals . This time could be different . Yeah , uh ... It 's from Welke . He wants answers about his cow . Poor Lenore . I have n't found any biological pathogens , no prions or parasites . Right now there 's no evidence that it came from inside the animal . Then ... outside ? so ..... who takes his place if he ca n't go ? An alternate . Right . First alternate . Thanks , doc . Looks like we 're going to need another bottle , Vincent , and , uh , some more blinis , if you do n't mind . Comin ' right up . Champagne . What you celebrating ? Actually , it 's Prosecco , and I am going to Titan . Dr . Welke had to resign . Turns out there 's no point in him going without his experiment . What a tragedy . Would you like a blini , sheriff Carter ? Why would I sabotage an experiment ? It would ruin my chances of getting on the mission . Yes , if you got caught , which is what 's happening right now . Oh ! I did n't do anything to Welke 's stupid cow , sheriff ! You know how I know ? Because cows do n't melt ! Ah ... Ow ! How 's Andy holding up ? You ca n't keep a good deputy down . Yeah , because he 's not a quitter . Well , I 'm going to go and help an Australian find some slime . Let me know if you need anything . You know , it 's her choice to not go to Titan . What ? I do n't care . Dude , do you know how many hours I spent coaching her on orbital mechanics ? And hydrostatics ? And then she just drops out . Leaves me ... Leaves you how ? Nothin ' . She 's a waste of my time . Can we just get back to trying to save Andy ? Cockroaches , not melted . Tarantulas , not melted . Millipedes , not melted . Uh-oh , I ... I think this one went the way of the cow . Oh . That one 's supposed to be goo . Plasmodial slime mold . Ca n't go to Titan without your slime mold . Tagging ostriches in the Sahara for a bit . And when we last saw each other ... Ah , water under the bridge , doll . Look , um ... I 'm not gon na say it did n't sting when you turned me down . I turned you down ? My proposal . You playing at something , Jo ? No , no . I just ... I 'm sorry , I was ... You asked me , and I turned you down . Because that 's what I do . Okay , so , uh , what 's next ? Mosquito larvae , not melted . Breeding mosquitoes for the Astraeus habitat . Well , that 's not gon na score you points with the crew . No , these are feeder ' skeeters , sustenance for my eptesicus fuscus . Big , brown bats . Happy in Earth 's atmosphere , but able to withstand a high-methane environment like Titan ... Genetically modified to provide fuel via their guano ... They 're beauts ! Taggart ... They 're gone . Firing circuits are charged , and ready . - Are we ? - Yes , ready when you are . Fargo , we are ready . Just about in position . Let 's hope it works this time . - Hi . - Hey . Oh , listen , we 're , uh , sending the portable FTL drive to him now . Um ... what do ... what do a cow and a jeep have in common ? What ? Well , um , what would cause them both to melt ? All right , we 're ready . Uh , safety 's off . A cow melted ? Um ... hey , Andy ? You , uh , you okay ? Well , if I had a hot cocoa , I would n't complain . His skin is starting to vitrify in the cold . Right , well , tell you what ... When you come back , we go to Cafe Diem , cocoa 's on me . Ready to activate ... What was that ? Really ? It did n't work , did it ? No , Jack , the blowback destroyed it on the pad . Astronaut Andy , ready for departure . Henry , how are we gon na get him home now ? All emergency personnel ... Any time now . I do n't know what else to do , Jack . All emergency personnel , please report ... Guys ? I 'm ready ! Ready to come home ! I get why Parrish would melt the cow , but why me bat crates ? Let 's ask your bats . Hey , are you sure we 're on the right track ? I mean , we 've got ta be a good mile out from G.D . by now . Aha . They 've been here . Recently . Might be looking for a dark place to roost . Every circuit for the FTL drive is falling offline . Oh ... 4 12 hours . The atmosphere is already starting to corrode his peripheral systems . Right . If we ca n't get him back , like , worst-case scenario , we just order a new Andy and plug in the backup disc , right ? No . It does n't work that way . First , Andy 's a ... A prototype . Second , everything Andy 's experienced through his emotion software builds unique pathways in his processing core . - So he 's , uh ... - A one-of-a-kind . Right . Whoa ! Boys , check this out . The circuits ... are liquefying . Wait , you said something about melting . Yeah . Lenore . And my jeep . And maybe G.D . Ah ! Oh . How is he ? Well , it 's a clean fracture . But he needs to stay off of it for six to eight weeks . Five minutes . I was a real astronaut ... for five minutes . Oh , leave me alone ! Look , whatever voodoo science you did is out of control . And it messed with Henry 's FTL machine . I ... Did ... Not ... Melt ... Lenore ! I think that he 's telling the truth . I scanned a sample of your liquefied jeep off of his shoe . Welke 's cow and your jeep did n't melt . They protonated . What ? Melting is a change in phase-state . Ice melts into liquid water . Protonation is violent . Their subatomic components actually ripped apart . Well , it does n't matter how he did it . The point is that he did it . So he did n't melt my jeep , he protonated it . Only a superacid could do that to your jeep . And it would leave fluorosulfuric traces in Parrish 's body , and there were none in his blood test . - Oh . - Told ya . Taggart ... Jim ..... Well , do n't even . Well , no I ... I hope I did n't hurt you . Well , thanks , sweetheart . It means a lot . I 'm not gon na say it did n't take me a while to get me bearings , but , uh , then I went on walkabout . Walkabout ? Where 'd you , uh , - where 'd you walk to ? - No , there is no " to . " You just go . A journey of self-discovery . You 'd hate it . The point is , when I was done , well , I 'd made me peace . With us . Peace . Well , that 'd be ... nice . Feel that ? What ? That breeze . Duck ! Oh ! Ah ! No ! Found ' em . Tell Allison this sample is from the main circuit panel . Okay . Jack , even if we can replace the melted wire , we do n't have a portable FTL to bring Andy back home . It was destroyed . And I do n't know if we can rebuild it . - Hey , boss ! - You there ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hey , pal , I 'm right here . My sensors are detecting a pretty severe methane storm , approaching due West . Uh , well , then you might want to work on building a shelter to break the wind . Will do . Uh , even so , the methane concentration is pretty intense . I 'm bound to corrode . You 've been through worse . Right ? And if anybody can handle it , you can . Hey , boss . Yeah . I need a favor . S.A.R.A.H . ? S.A.R.A.H . , um ... Sorry about this morning , but , uh ... We have to talk . All right , sheriff . That is far too harsh an environment - for his soft skin ! - Yeah . You must get him back to Earth as soon as possible . Right , and we 're doing everything that we can . But just in case , he 's asked me to tell you . That you 're his ... Casita bonita . I guess he really cares about you . I just did n't ... appreciate how much . Sheriff , there 's movement in my conduits . Yeah , I ... I ... You can feel ... emotional . No , my sensors are registering unidentified movement inside my conduits . Un ... identified movement ? Whoa ! Ohh ! Oh oh oh ! And the 10,000 little needle claws in me , and S.A.R.A.H . ' S all covered in crap . It 's called guano , actually . Oh , thank you , Batman , where are they now ? Well , they left the S.M.A.R.T . On it . H ... hey , Jo . What 's up ? Fire suppression is in effect . All personnel have been evacuated . No , they have n't , you frakkin ' brainless piece of software ! Put your back into it , Parrish ! Hey ... Where 's the fire ? There is n't one ! The suppression system went off by itself and sealed the doors ! - And the misty stuff ? - Sucking out all the oxygen . Ah ! Ah ! Damn it ! - All right , everybody out ! - Come on , people , let 's go ! - Everybody out ! - Come with me ! Out ! Out ! Come on , let 's go ! All personnel have been evacuated . Let 's keep going . Keep it moving ! Let me guess . These are the sensors that are supposed to detect when there are people inside . Yes . Same sensors that detect when there 's a fire . More protonation . That 's melting . - Well , so much for G. I 'll institute fire-safety protocols . Shut down any combustion-related projects . Well , that 's great , but if we ca n't figure this out , a broken sprinkler system 's gon na be the least of our problems . Oof . Oh ! Taggart ? Blast ! Nearly caught up with the wiley little buggers . Uh , were the bats in the walls ? - Uh-uh . Passing through back home on their way to the roost . Judging from their spoor . That 's disgusting . Wait . Did you track them back to Welke 's farm , or to the FTL service passage ? Well , both . Uh , they escaped on the road near Welke 's farm then turned toward G.D . So things are melting wherever the bats fly ? S.A.R.A.H . Check you out , man , you beat me to it . First bachelor pad on Titan . I do n't think S.A.R.A.H . would like that very much ! Atta boy . Keep thinking about S.A.R.A.H . ? Talk to me . Hello , sheriff . Hey ! How ya ... how ya doing ? You all right ? No . I can feel my connections dissolving . - It hurts . - Okay . All right . We 'll get you some help , okay ? You just hang on . Oh ... Fargo , get here as soon as you can . - Sheriff ? - Yeah ? Please tell deputy Andy that I love him . Okay . - Hey , guys . - Hey , how 's S.A.R.A.H . ? Well , uh , Fargo has her hooked up to some sort of computer life-support system , but we need an answer fast . And the answer is bats . Yeah , but , how 's a bat gon na make something melt ? Taggart genetically altered their binary parotid glands . Why would you do that ? Oh , to create guano rich in perchloric acid . Uh , clean , safe fuel for the Titan habitat . Okay , uh , what do we got ? We got , uh , the cow , uh , my jeep , and the FTL jumping machine , so ... What do they have in common ? Okay , I ... I ... let 's try aminos , phenols , uh , xylene . Xylene , xy ... um , Dr . Welke 's , uh , cow fleas were made of xylene . It 's also in wire insulation , uh , S.A.R.A.H . ' s walls , uh , auto paint . That ... That would explain my jeep . All my bio-containment crates were xylene-based . They crapped their way out ? Potential acidity factor is off the charts . Ho ... hold ... hold on . Bat doody and xylene make superacid ? Right . Bat doody , really ? Well ... - Hey , check this out . - We need to find those bats . You said you knew where they were roosting . Getting closer . A massive storage tank full of methyl iodide gas . - It 's perfect . - But it 's poison . Uh , for them , I mean . Nice and homey . Uh , if you like the atmosphere on Titan , - which they do . - Okay . To neutralize the superacid and stop the melting I 'm gon na need an enzyme sample from the binary parotid gland of one of those bats . - We 're gon na have to go inside . - Oh , wait , wait . Into the huge tank of poison-gas bats and superacid ? Ah , yeah ! Awesome . Sorry . Wow . Was that so hard ? What are you talking about ? Sorry . ' Cause I never heard you say it before . Zane , leaving the mission was the right decision for me . Look , I should n't have to apologize , because it 's not about you . Yeah , then maybe you should 've clarified that - before I got involved . And you let me think you really wanted to go the distance when you were really just playing around . Fine . Fine . I am sorry for not knowing exactly what I wanted . Hmm ? Well , that 's the crappiest apology ever , is n't it ? Do n't dawdle in there . It 'll be not long before our gear starts dissolving in the tank . Fantastic . Ho .. Ly .. crap , Batman . Now , to get a proper sample , we 'll need a mature female . Well , let 's get one and get the hell outta here . Unfortunately , a colony of brown bats is normally 85% male . Of course it is . And the difference between the boys and the girls is , uh ... Females are larger . Ready ? For what ? You sure that 's a good idea ? I 'm provoking a startle response . I can see that . Male . Male . Male . Male . Female ? One ... Two ... Three ... Are n't you , slugger ? Okay . Okay . Bye-bye , bats . Better wrangle me strays and seal this place up . Allison and Taggart isolated the amino acids from the bats . Now I just need to repair the damage to the FTL . I 'm already on it . How 's S.A.R.A.H . ? On artificial life support . I was able to connect an external hard drive before the crash , but , um , we 'll know more once she 's rebooted . Thanks for asking . Well , I know how attached you are . In a not-at-all creepy way . They may be A.I . , but S.A.R.A.H . and Andy have a real connection . It would be tragic if they could n't say good-bye , and she became our first A.I . widow . Well , we all have to live with disappointment . Enough with the doom and gloom already . It 's so obvious . What are you talking about ? You and Jo . It 's not my place to be disappointed . It 's not like we 're even officially dating . Honestly , I do n't know what we are . Then find out . Pushing her away is n't making it easier on either of you . Current temperature , 310 degrees below 0 . Wind speed , 122 knots . Hang in there , Andy . You 're doin ' great . My internal diagnostics tell me quite the opposite . But , uh ... Thank you for saying otherwise . Well , no one ever said being a deputy in Eureka was easy . You know , uh , it 's kind of funny , Jo ... Me being here on Saturn 's largest moon . Uh , funny , how ? You wake up in the morning and ... You never know where the day is gon na take you . Well , that is funny . Hey , Henry . The methane storm is damaging the camera .

How are the repairs going ? Well , too slow . Andy does n't have much time . I know . You know , um ... I know he 's a robot , but , uh ... I feel bad . I mean , I just wish there was something I could do . You 've done a lot . He still has a chance because of you . - Well ... - Hey ! Hey , listen . We 've improvised an FTL slingshot that has a chance of grabbing Andy back from Titan . Now , we 've lost the comm feed , so there 's no way for us to tell him where he needs to be . Maybe we could show him . Here , come here . Hey , partner . How 's it going ? Andy ? Heeeey . Are you an angel ? Not even close . Allison gave me a holo-communicator she 's been testing for the mission . Look , right now we got to get back to the place where you zapped in . I do n't know if I can make it , boss . Just try , buddy . What 's a sheriff without a deputy ? The FTL extraction point is just ahead . It should be a piece of cake . Easy for the hologram to say . Come on , buddy . All right ? S.A.R.A.H . needs you home safe . Wow . Well , there 's something you do n't see every day . Andy , we 've got to reach that boulder , right over there . Okay ? Try ? Just hurry . I 'm losing the signal . Okay . I lost the signal . He was a few steps away . Stand by . - Oh ! - Oh ! Yeah ! Hey . Oh-h-h ... Th ... thanks for bringing me back , boss . Well , I 'd say we 're even . - Okay . - Okay . Hey . How 's Andy ? Defrosting , but he 'll recover . Yeah , he 's tough . Could I ? Sure . What 's up ? Now , just ... just give me a sec , okay ? Okay , this mission is a big deal . - Oh ! - I know . It 's history . It 's just when I thought about doing it , I always thought about doing it with you . I am sorry ... If I let you down . Less crappy apology ? Yeah , a little . So for the record , what is this ? You and me ? - We 're friends . It ... Yeah , I got that , but ... but ... But that 's ... not what you 're asking me , is it ? You want to know if I 'll wait for you ? Will you ? I do n't know . Because you do n't know how you feel about me ? No , no , because I ... I do n't know how I feel about a lot of things . And I am trying to figure it out , I ... I just ca n't make that kind of a promise until I do . Okay . Okay ? Honesty . I never thought we 'd get here . I guess you never know where the day will take you . Yeah . Fargo ? You there ? Yup . Well , we stopped the melting and replaced the damaged components . All that 's left now is to bring her back online . Did you recover her memory files ? Unfortunately , they were corrupted during the melting . Some of her data was permanently lost . S.A.R.A.H . ? You there ? Yes , Dr . Fargo . How are you ? I 'm fine . It 's good to hear my ... your voice . Hey , S.A.R.A.H . Uh , you had us worried there for a second . Worried about what , sheriff ? - Uh ... - Nothing . I have someone here for you , someone who 's pretty anxious to talk to ya . Hi , honey . I 'm home . S.A.R.A.H . ? Everything okay ? I 'm sorry . I forget sometimes that you ca n't see me smile . I was afraid I 'd lost you , baby . Take more than a Titanic methane storm to keep me from my gal . Come get warm . It 's 290 degrees below 0 on Titan . So I discovered . Thank you . I try not to think about it . Well , I guess my work here is done . You did a great job , Fargo . - Thanks . Yeah . Seems that way . It 's okay . Does n't feel so crowded . Jo was n't enough ? You want Andy , too ? Well , I ... want you . I think a ... A house is n't a home unless you share it with the person that you love . You realize I come as a package deal with Kevin and Jenna , right ? Really ? You ... no ... Yeah . Living together , huh ?

" I tried to install some dowels in an oak shelf unit . They expanded and would n't fit in the holes . What can I do ? " Most people do n't know , but you can shrink a dowel if you put it in the microwave for two minutes . That 's true . And then just sprinkle a little cheddar on top , you 'll have a nice oak-aroni and cheese . You want to keep a lookout for Al 's new book , Cooking with Lumber . " Fenwick . That 's a great place . They have the National Earmuff Museum . It 's open late July through early August because otherwise they 're wearing them . " I 'm getting my driver 's license this year . I know a lot about cars . But I 'd like to learn even more . I think if my parents bought me my own , it would be a great educational experience . What do you think ? " Well , I think , uh , cars are expensive , especially for a teenager . - So , I 'd have to say ... - Yes ! Yes ! ... Brad , if you want a car , you get a job . All right , pal ? I might not have much experience , sir , but I 'm a fast learner . And if you hire me , I know you wo n't regret it . Sorry , kid . You 're not what we 're looking for . lt 's just a part-time job selling wieners . Wait a minute . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You back that wiener wagon right back up . There 's no such thing as " just a job . " Someone 's paying you for something , take it seriously . Dad , he 'd be in charge of relish . Here 's a tip . Compliment them on their sauerkraut . Tell them it 's right up there with the kraut burrito at Casa de Bratwurst . Wo n't he see right through me if I kiss up ?  Excuse me . The guy 's the manager of a Wiener Barn . How sharp can the guy be ? Can you help me ? Can anybody really help anybody ? We 're all alone . And then we die . It 's time for my break . That 's unbelievable . I 've taken one ten-minute break in my life . - I 'm Rob . I own the place . - Brad . Nice to meet you . What can I do for you , Brad ? I 'm a little early for my job interview across the mall , I thought I 'd check out your snowboards . Snowboarding . That 's how I ended up in my second body cast . On the up side , I ended up selling the entire surgical team a fleet of kayaks . Excuse me , Brad . There 's a beautiful woman there looking at a $1 , 500 bicycle . I love this job . - Well , hidy-ho , Taylor lad . - Hey , Wilson . So , what brings you to this indoor amalgam of vendors , colloquially known as " the mall ? " I 'm killing time before my job interview at the Wiener Barn . What are you doing ? Well , Brad , I 'm on a quest for a new hobby . I 've narrowed it down to either channeling Aztec spirits or rollerblading . These harder , faster ones are for outdoor . The bearings are rated by ABEC numbers that go from one to 1 2 . Most use three . Well , I do n't know , Brad . Maybe channeling Aztec spirits is a lot safer . Are n't the Aztecs the ones that cut the hearts out of people still alive ?  I 'm gon na go for those Turbo Roller 2000s . You know , they 're on sale over at Larson 's . Really ? Well , maybe I 'll go over there and take a gander . - Good luck with that Wiener Barn . - Thanks . Oh , by the way , Brad , a little tip . Compliment the sauerkraut . They just love that . So you 're also an expert on rollerblading . Well , I would n't say I 'm an expert . You 're doing a good job driving customers out of my store . I 'm sorry . That was my neighbor Wilson . What do you say you work for me part-time ? - Are you serious ? - Yeah . If you 're on my payroll , you 'll keep customers in my store . And that 's kind of what I 'm going for here , Brad . Well , it sounds a lot better than steaming wieners . What do you say we go talk salary over at Java Joe 's ? You a coffee lover , Brad ? Yeah , and one day , I hope to be a coffee drinker . Coffee , anyone ? We do n't drink coffee . We 're kids . And the word on the street is , so are you . Hey , as of today , I 'm a working man . And a working man needs his morning coffee . A little more sugar , and the working man can fly to work . Pass me the business section . Well , there 's the working stiff . Having a good day ? Thanks for the coffee . I 'm ready to rack up some big numbers . - All right . - Well , I 'm out of here . When you get home tonight , we 're gon na block-sand some of the panels on the hot rod . - You got it . - Good luck , kid . I 'm not a kid anymore . I 'm a working man . So long , boys . Dad , could I get some lunch money ? Hi . I 'm looking for some new golf clubs .  Golf ? Now there 's a total waste of time . What , do you wear those silly clothes too ?  Actually , sir , our golf section 's right over there . Our best clubs are probably our graphite . But if you want something a little less expensive , try steel . See what feels comfortable . I 'll be back . Nice work , Brad . I 'm gon na help the golf guy . I 'm trying to make a sale . You know , it 's kind of what I 'm going for here . You 're doing a great job . You 've made more sales in one day than Holly 's made in ... Actually , Holly 's never made a sale . Well , if you do n't mind me asking , why did you hire her ? I 've got a good heart . And she 's my sister . Well , maybe one day she 'll finally wake up and take her job seriously , huh ? I need a two-hour lunch . I 'm getting my tongue pierced . - Does n't that hurt ? - Yeah . - Hey , everybody . - Hey , Brad . - How was the first day at the new job ? - Unbelievable ! I took in the highest first-day gross of any salesman still living with his parents . - Ha-ha ! That 's my boy ! - All right . - Congratulations . Wow ! Well , I guess that 's OK , as long as you keep up with your schoolwork . Do n't forget , you 've got a big day coming up in two weeks . That 's right ! We 're putting the engine in the hot rod . Brad is taking his PSAT tests . Oh , God , how I hated when those tests were over . - The PSATs are really important . - Oh , do n't worry . I 'm sure Rob 'll give me the afternoon off . He 's a great guy . I 'll be back . I got ta study brochures . Wait ! I thought we were gon na block-sand the hot rod . No , I ca n't do it tonight , Dad . Rob says if you want to get ahead , you 've got to work while the other guy sleeps . Well , maybe I 'll wake the other guy up and he can help me . - He sure likes that new boss of his . - Everything Brad wants . - Everything I want . Except the condo . So , Jill , you in the mood for a little block-sanding tonight ? Well , maybe . If you spend some time talking to me first . I 'll do it myself . There you go , ma'am . Have a great day . Psst . Brad , you , uh , talk to Holly about going out with me ? - Yeah . -  What 'd she say ? Her exact words were , " Jason is a repulsive maggot . " Did she smile when she said it ? - Holly ! - You 're a disgusting worm . All right ! I 'm moving up the food chain .  Are you here again ? No . Well , I was just leaving , Rob , my man . I 'm off to the lingerie shop . You never know when some young lady 's gon na need a  second opinion . Well , I sort of had plans . But I could always cancel them . Well , great . Just let me tell Holly that we 're going . And remind her that this is a store and all these things are for sale . Hey , Brad , I hope you 're hungry . Listen , would you mind if I canceled ? Well , no . What 's the problem ? Rob wants to take me to lunch and talk business . Oh , yeah . All right . OK . Yeah . Where 's he gon na take ya ? To this place where the waitresses dress up like pirate wenches . - Pirate 's Plank . - Yeah ! Yeah . Watch out for wench number three . Her parrot ... arrh ... bites . - So we can have lunch another time ? - Yeah . I 'll get lunch someplace else . See you home . - All right . - All right . - Hey , Brad . You ready to go ? - Yeah . - Then you drive . - All right ! Hi . Where 'd you go for lunch ? -  - Polish food .  Polish food from Stan 's in Hamtramck . belches ,  Why did n't you and Brad just have lunch at the mall ? He made plans to eat with Rob . Wow ! His boss is taking him out to lunch . - This job is really working out . - Maybe it 's just me , but I think he 's picking up a lot of bad habits down there . - Noticed what he does in the morning ? - Could n't be any worse than you . - Reading the financial section . - What 's wrong with that ? You do n't do that . You read the sports section first . Then the comics . And then whatever that first section 's called . The news . He 's been reading those brochures . He should be out doing fun things . Jill , these are Brad 's formative block-sanding years . This is so sweet . You 're jealous of Rob . I 'm not jealous of Rob . I just do n't want Brad to become so obsessed with work - that it takes over his life . - This is new and exciting to him now . Once he gets used to it , he 'll calm down . Then it 'll be part of his routine . Yeah . Kind of like marriage , huh ? When you first get married , it 's exciting . Then it , you know ... You know , it turns ... lt 's not , you know , it 's not ... lt 's not like that at all . It 's more ... It 's not a job . It 's more of an adventure .   Why do n't I get that ? Hello ? Hello , Angela . You want to talk to Brad , huh ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . But , uh , Rob asked me to do inventory tonight . I do n't know . Maybe next weekend . Yeah . All right . Talk to you tomorrow . Bye . Let me get this straight . Rather than going out with a beautiful girl , you would rather count shoes . It 's a chance to really bump up my paycheck . So , Dad , ballpark : How much are you pulling down ? That 's a good question . And if you ever ask me again , you are out of the ballpark ! When 's dinner ? And hello to you too . We 're gon na eat as soon as Brad gets back from his PMS test . That 's today ? I mean , I just saw Brad through the window at the sporting goods store . He was supposed to leave at noon to take the test . Well , uh , maybe it was n't through the window at the store . Maybe I saw Brad through the window at school . Yeah . Got ta go . - I knew this job was gon na be trouble . - I ca n't believe he did n't take it . Uh , Sports Universe . This is Brad . Uh , you 're busted . lt 's Dad . What are you doing there ? You 're supposed to be taking your PSATs ! Holly was supposed to take over for me at noon . But she had to go to the doctor because she had a tongue rash . We told you you could take this job as long as it did n't interfere with school . Remember ? Look , I can take the PSATs another day . Rob never even went to college and he 's doing pretty well . I 'm with a customer . I 'll talk to you later . No , you 'll .. He 'll talk to us later . Well , you 're right . Rob is definitely a bad influence . - I told you he was gon na be trouble . Excuse me . Whoa ! is Brad Taylor here ? is anybody really here ? Or are we all just random combinations of sub-atomic particles ? # Oooee-ooee-ooee # Follow me . I 'm looking for a random grouping of sub-atomic molecules with blond hair that looks like my son Brad . Yeah . Yeah . He went on an errand for my money-grubbing , capitalist brother . I 'll wait for him . I 'll sit in this fancy little chair here . Yeah , you break it , you buy it .   Well , I see you 've gotten to know the chair . Actually , the chair just got to know me . Howdy . I 'm Tim Taylor . I 'm Brad 's dad . - Hey , the Tool Man ! - Yeah . A chair like this would really come in handy after a hard day of injuries and explosions . Well , I did n't come here to talk about chairs . I 'm Rob . Yeah . I know who you are , Rob . You got the Porsche and the ski condo at Bowie Mountain , you know . You think working here is more important than college tests . What are you talking about ? I never said that . Well , then why did Brad skip his test to cover for jolly Holly over there ? - I did n't know he had a test . - Well , he did . He does n't care about that now that you got his head filled - with all these crazy ideas . - Like what ? Well , how about like , " Rob did n't go to college . He 's doing pretty well . " Yeah , I 'm doing pretty well now . Brad does n't know about the crummy jobs I had before I got here . Well , maybe it 'd be a good idea if you told him . - Well , the problem is ... Dad , what are you doing here ? I came down here to tell you I want you to quit this job . Because I missed the PSATs ? I told you I would take them another day . Your dad wants to make sure you got priorities straight . Rob , I think I can handle this . I just want to make sure you got your priorities straight . I was gon na say that . There 's nothing more important than education . Your dad 's right . Wish I had a better one . - Rob ? - Sorry . I 'm pretty damn proud of my education . Not that I flaunt it . There 's a lot of people I 've got convinced I have no education at all . All right . I made a mistake . I should n't have skipped the test . I did n't want to let Rob down . If I cared , I 'd resent that . Look , you guys let me know what you decide , all right ? I 'm gon na go over and give Holly her annual evaluation . You stink ! Come on , Dad . Give me one more chance . I 'll take my PSATs , I 'll keep my grades up and I 'll show you that school comes first . Great . Are n't you forgetting one important thing ? - What Mom thinks ? - Who ? Mom ? Yeah ! Yes ! Yes ! What your mother thinks . That , and you know , working on the hot rod with me .  OK , Dad . I promise no matter how busy I get , I 'll always make time for the hot rod . That 's my boy . That 's my man . Come on . I 'll walk you out . -  - Hey , Wilson . Well , hidy-ho , Taylor lads . And if I say so myself , the results have been bitchin ' , dude ! - Do you really know how to skate ? - Do I know how to skate ? Watch me .

@@5234341 Can you give us any more revs , Charge ? Temps are on the high side and the props are coming clear in the roughest . But I reckon she 'll cope with a few more . OK , roger . Do you hear there ? Captain speaking . You 'll be pleased to know we 're nearly through the worst of it and we 'll have clear skies by morning . " Oh ! My baby ! You kiss me ! Kiss me ! " Unlike some of us , ET , I 've got standards . I reckon that Buffer 's a one-fish kind of guy . Yee-hee ! Righto , you lot ! I want these uppers clear for a freshwater washdown ! Spider , you 're in charge ! Yes , Buff ! That storm overnight sure made a mess . You ever seen it blow as big , ET ? Mate , I slept like a baby . Did n't feel a thing . Do n't know what you 're talking about . You 're pulling my chain , right ? The waves were massive . They were at least 20 metres . Looks like we did some illegal fishing in that storm . You were saying ? I believe you , Spider . How else did we get all this seafood up here ? Hey ! There 's something big floating in the water right ahead ! 200 yards ! Attention , bridge ! Attention , bridge ! RO reports something in the water dead ahead . I have a visual . Captain has the ship . Port 30 . Stop both engines . Port 30 . Stop both engines . 100 yards and closing right ahead . 30 port along , sir . Both engines stopped . Very good . Full astern both engines ! Full astern both engines . Let 's go take a look . Stop both engines . Stop both engines . A standard dry van , by the looks of it . Swept off the deck of a container ship in the storm ? Or a smaller coastal trader . That was a fortunate miss , boss . An understatement , Nav . Do n't want us floating into it . Good eyes , RO . Or should that be ship 's lookout ? Just a lucky spot , sir . We 'll need to record the container 's serial number before we decide what to do with it . Who 's up for a recce ? It 'll mean one of you in the drink . Suit up , RO . He always goes paper . Well , ca n't get any closer . If we catch this thing on any sharp edges , we 'll be swimming home . So ... I 'll , uh , keep an eye out for sharks . It 's a 20-foot isotainer . I mean , I ca n't see a BIC Code . Alright ! I 'll go have a look ! Right . Charlie 2 , this is Romeo 2 . There does n't appear to be any numbers on the container . Over . Roger , Romeo 2 . We might have to sink it . Over . Whoa ! And who 's going to drive it back to base , Romeo ? You ? According to Customs , there 's been no report of a ship losing cargo , but who knows ? So it 's been in the water awhile . Want me to prep a gunnery shoot , sir ? I 'd prefer to know what 's inside it first , Buff . We do n't want to create an environmental hazard . As opposed to a shipping hazard . You 've got a point , X . Prep the 50-cal . Aye-aye , sir . There 's an open hatch on the underside . Yeah ? What 's in it ? Nothing . It 's just full of water . So , what 's keeping it afloat ? Uh ... an air pocket ? Romeo 2 , this is Charlie 2 . Any luck with the serial number ? Over . Uh , negative , sir . But RO reports the container is empty . Over . Oh , that 's good news . Head back to ' Hammersley ' ET . Roger . Hey , ET ? Do you see that ? Yeah . Some sort of ... vent . So ? Well , these things are normally sealed airtight . Keep the moisture out . There 'll be plenty of moisture inside when the 50-cal 's had its way - come on . No , I 'm going to swim underneath , inside it . See what 's keeping it above the waterline . You said it 's an air pocket . With a vent on the top , all the air would have escaped . No , no , RO , RO , RO ! Do n't ... Oh , you ... ! 50-cal gun 's crew - close up , clear away , provide ammunition to the mount . Providing ammunition to the mount . Alright . I 'm taking bets to see how many rounds it 'll take . My money 's on a single shot . One shot for me . Trust the Spider . I vote for three . I think you boys might miss the first couple . Whoo ! Sorry , boss . If the navy permitted a wager I 'd bet on two rounds of the 50-cal . I 'm with you , sir . There 's a false bulkhead about halfway in . There must be a recess of air above that keeping it buoyant . Oh , right . You mean an AIR POCKET ! Come on . It 's got a false wall , ET . It suggests smugglers . Or a partition to separate the goods . Come on . Let 's get in the boat . We 're going . What are they doing out there , having a fish ? Give ' em the hurry-up , X . Romeo 2 , we 've got a waypoint to make by lunchtime . Hurry it up . Roger . You heard the lady . Come on . R ... God ! What 's this clown doing now ? Hello ? ! Do you have a problem there , ET ? Negative , sir . No problem . It might be water swishing around , but ... What the hell is he doing ? What the hell are you doing ? ! ET , I 'm starting to lose my patience . I want you to order RO into the RHIB . Over . Hello ! This is the Australian Navy ! Is there anybody in there ? ! RO , if you do n't get back inside this boat , I swear ... Uh ... Charlie 2 , this is Romeo 2 . We 're going to need some bolt-cutters here immediately . There seems to be someone trapped inside the container . Over . There 's more than one . Not certain of the language . Could be Vietnamese , could be Mandarin . RO reports there 's more than one inside . Unsure of nationality . Roger that . Prepare the quarterdeck . Ow ! Hey . Hey , hey . Take it easy , guys . Take it easy . Just a little at a time , OK ? Stay warm . It 's OK . It 's OK . Hey , RO ? How 's your Korean ? About as good as my Swedish . Imagine getting stuck in a tin can like that . No wonder they 're freaked out . At least they can have a wash now , get rid of some of that stink . Why ca n't they just have a shower in the juniors ? Spider , it 's against quarantine regulations . They have to remain on the quarterdeck . It just does n't seem right , that 's all . You really want to share your rack with some smelly illegal ? Great . Hey , RO . Why do n't you go below , get out of your stinger suit ? I 'm alright . It was n't a request . Five North Korean nationals . All in need of varying degrees of medical treatment . None serious . What 's your ETA at base , sir ? 1600 . Roger . We 'll have ambulances standing by . Their radio must be playing up . It was a very garbled transmission . Position ? 10 miles south-west of us . Roger . We 'll rendezvous with them on our way back to base . Aye , sir . Yeah , about , uh , 10 mile north-east of here . We nearly ran into it in the storm last night . Uh , sir , uh , the gentlemen aboard fishing vessel ' Moonshine ' are reporting a derelict shipping container . You 'll be happy to know we 've already dealt with it , fellas . Ah , right , yeah . We would 've blown it out of the water if we had the firepower . Looks like you 've got just about everything else on that boat . Yeah . Yeah , she 's a beauty , is n't she ? Named her after my very famous home-brew . Hey , Spider , is that you , mate ? How are you going ? How were those crabs we gave you ? They 're talking about seafood . I do n't know what you 're talking about , mate . Well , then , hooroo , Spider . Keep up the good work , mate . See you later , fellas ! See you , mate ! Spider . Sir ? You met those fishermen on Bright Island ? Uh , yes , sir . When we were rescuing the marine biologist . They gave me a bag of crabs they 'd been collecting . It 's a pretty flash boat for a couple of crab-harvesters . They were pretty nice crabs , Charge . Sir , uh , the Buffer said you were down here . Just decoding a deltext . Uh , none of the North Koreans speak any English , so getting any useful information out of them is almost impossible . That 's a job for Immigration . Mm-hm . The fishermen just now , and Spider 's crabs - I noticed you eyeballing their boat . Well , I 'm sure if something serious was going on there , they 'd never have let Ursula Morrell back on the island . You 'd think so . Although Ursula seems to have disappeared . And I ca n't locate her . If you 're really concerned , you should definitely notify the feds about it . This is from Marshall . Informing me that Robert 's father has died . What ? Taking over my duties , sir ? Um ... take a seat , RO . RO , one of the most difficult aspects of my job as commanding officer of this ship is ... having to give people bad news . How can I help you , sir ? It 's my unfortunate duty to inform you that your father ... has just passed away . Please accept my deepest condolences on behalf of myself and of the entire ship 's company . Sorry . I thought for a second then you were going to sack me . Hey . Hey . But , um ... he 's doing the best he can , but he has n't got much to work with . Well , that 's all anyone can ask . Yeah . Well , if you ask me , I think their problems go a lot further than the physical . Mmm . Oh ! Oh , I 'm sorry , sir . You ca n't be up here . If you just come with me . It 's alright . You ... It 's OK . It 'll be OK . Oh ! That 's alright . I 've got it . OK . It 's yours . That 's yours . Just back to the quarterdeck . Thank you . Is there anyone you want to call , RO ? No . You can organise leave when we get back to port . I 'll pierhead-jump a replacement . If it 's all the same with you , sir , I 'd rather keep working . Well , you 'll need some time off . At least for the funeral . OK , RO . Er , by the way well done this morning . Thank you , sir . Do you have ANY insight into what just happened then ? Oh , you mean the absolute lack of reaction ? Yeah . Unfortunately not . I do n't have any idea of RO 's family circumstances , but that was ... disturbing . And he does n't make you feel like you can ask . It 's like there 's this brick wall . For a communicator , he is ... strangely uncommunicative . Well , people react to loss in different ways , I guess . His father could n't be that old . Maybe he 's in shock . In which case , there may be a delayed reaction . Ah , that 's true . We should be alert for it . It could become a duty of care issue . Keep an eye on him , X . Yeah . Get your stinking sack out of my face . Hey , you right , mate ? Swain ! We 've got to get him down below . Can you grab the kit , mate ? You 've got him . Alright . Sit him up here . OK . Robert ? Robert ? You still with us ? Robert ? He must have cut his arm opening up that container . He was fine when he got back to the boat , though . Yeah , but salt water , the compression of the stinger suit could have stemmed the blood flow for a bit . Hey , Robert ? What ? Wake up . Oi ! I 'm alright . You did a shocking job of wrapping this , mate . Yeah , well , I only had one arm . Oooh ! I do n't have the equipment or the expertise to deal with this . This needs proper cleaning and suturing . No , stuff it . Just wrap it tight and ... Oh , no , no , no ! Come back here ! I help . Sir , sir ... I ... I ... I ... doctor . I ... I help . Doc ... tor . I ... help . It looks pretty good to me . I do n't think I 'm going to touch it . You 're not going to restitch it ? What for ? The stitches are neat . They 're clean . They 're excellent , in fact . I could n't improve on that . I 'm just going to give you a little jab . The file says you 're due for a tetanus . So ... whose fine needlework is this , anyway ? Your ship 's medical officer ? Hmm ? Dixon . Glad you had that bag . You speak English ? Yes ... er , some . You should have told us . It would have ... helped us communicate a little better with you . Afraid . Uh ... sent back ... Pyongyang . Uh ... arrest by ... government . Uh ... shot . Yeah . Yeah , I understand . Still ... Anyway , I just wanted to say thank you . The navy , Coastwatch . You must find . Others on ship . What ? There are ... sorry , other people ? Other ... other people being smuggled ? Other , uh ... box . My ... my wife , son . You ... you must find . You must find . Please . Please . So , how good is this man 's English ? Rudimentary , sir , but I 've gathered there are four of them on the second container , including his wife and teenage son . All wanting a better life . Sir , we have to find that container , rescue these people . Coastwatch is on the lookout ... No , sir , I mean ... that ' Hammersley ' should join in , now that we know there are others on board . I appreciate your enthusiasm , RO , and I 'll certainly contact NAVCOM . Thank you , sir . In the meantime , RO ... I 've got to admit , RO , I 'm having trouble understanding the rationale . You know you 're entitled to compassionate leave . With ... respect , sir , it 's quite simple . My father 's dead . Going to his funeral is n't going to change that . But these people are still alive . I can make a difference here . According to the statement this Dr Soong gave Immigration , they boarded the boat in Denpasar and you plucked them out of the ocean , what , there ? Correct , sir . Which gives a likely route and an area to focus our search on . Now , it 's my guess the smugglers will let them off somewhere east of Darwin . If they have n't done so already . That 's a reasonable assumption , sir . What ? You do n't agree with it ? The news of the Koreans is already over the wire . So , where are they heading ? Well , if I was master of the ship I 'd turn south-west and look for somewhere off this coast . It 's an awfully long coastline , sir . Oh , look , ' Hammersley ' can have a look in the south-west . Get onto Coastwatch , get them to get a plane up at first light . Thanks , sir . Agent Murphy . Commander . You seem to be living here . Oh , just tidying up some paperwork . Actually , I 've been meaning to talk to you . Have you heard anything recently from Ursula Morrell ? The marine biologist ? Well ... it seems you know her a hell of a lot better than I do . Why would I have heard from her ? I have reason to believe that she may have disappeared . From her home or from the city ? All I know for certain is she 's moved out of her apartment ... it 's a matter for local cops , mate . If you 're concerned , file a missing persons report . Oh , I just thought you might be interested , that 's all . Given that she 's connected with your investigation . What investigation ? The mysterious poisoning of her colleague on Bright Island . Not so mysterious . Tragic accident . Oh , that was your conclusion , was it ? Ah , Greg . Good timing . I 'm sorry . Have you finished ? Yeah . We 're finished . Coastwatch have ID 'd three vessels within our search area that have containers on their decks . Here , here ... and here . This one is the ' Kamakura Express ' out of Nagasaki . She did berth at Denpasar , but she 's around 7,000 TEU . Too big to have lost a container . These other two are smaller coastal traders - the ' Prins Alexander ' and the ' Pacific Mariner ' We 're unsure of their ports of call . If one of these ships has lost a container , it should n't be too hard to tell . Once we 're close . Er , could you give me a little bit of space here , RO ? Sorry , ma'am . Coming up on our first contact , sir . Roger that , Nav . RO , commence contact procedure . I have a visual . Green five ... far . I took your advice , by the way . Spoke to Agent Murphy about Ursula Morrell . I did n't get much joy there , but at least I tried . He did n't think her disappearance was suspicious ? He did n't seem to react when I told him she 'd vacated her apartment . Are you saying th ... What ARE you saying ? I find it strange when someone ups and leaves without even a goodbye . Is that right ? You really do see things in terms of black and white , do n't you , X ? The ' Pacific Mariner ' is slowing , sir . Request to be part of the boarding party , sir . Go for it . Australian Navy , sir . Anyone else on board ? Uh , the crew . Let me give you a hand there . Uh , that wo n't be necessary . I 'm Lieutenant McGregor from Australian warship ' Hammersley ' And your name is ? Richard Gallagher . Call me Rick . Are you master of this vessel , Mr Gallagher ? And its owner . We 've been tasked under the Customs Act to search vessels in this area . Would you be able to tell me what 's in these containers ? I 'll show you if you like . Thank you . The captain looks a bit of a rogue . In a good way . I can see to the back . No false wall . Are you missing any containers ? Uh , we unloaded these two yesterday . All in order here , X . I 'd offer you all a bottle , but , uh ... the container 's not refrigerated . These crates are stacked too tight to see in . We 'll have to pull them all out . I do n't think that 'll be necessary . I ca n't see all the way to the back , ma'am . I 'm satisfied they 're not here . I 'm not , ma'am . I recommend that we empty the container . Your recommendation is noted . Let 's wrap things up here . Ma'am , I really insist we at least take some of these ... Leader , return to the RHIB . They might still be in there . Leader ... They could still be alive ! Return to the RHIB now . I apologise for that . No need . You handled it really well . Thank you . No . Thank YOU . It 's not every day I 'm boarded by the navy . You 've given me a great story to tell down the pub tonight . Oh ! They ca n't raise anyone on VHF . Thanks , Spide . X - Ray 2 , this is Charlie 2 . Anything to report there ? Over . Negative , sir . Everything seems to be in order here . Over . Then it 's time to head home , X . Charlie 2 out . ET . Let 's go . I hope you find what you 're looking for . You wanted to see me , ma'am ? Come in . I do n't appreciate my authority being tested as you did on that boarding . I will not tolerate it . Yes , ma'am . I realise I overstepped the mark . It was out of concern for the missing Koreans . Yes . Your sensitivity has been obvious to everyone . Now , I am going to overlook it - this time only , in view of your circumstances . What circumstances ? Your recent bereavement . I can only assume it caused you to behave irrationally . X ? Ma'am ! I am warning you ... I 'm not feeling grief . I 'm relieved . My father was a mongrel . He was emotionally and psychologically abusive . He was a drunk . And I 'm relieved he 's dead , because it gives me closure . Now , I I understand that that must seem strange to you . I know that family relationships are n't supposed to be like that . But mine mine w ... RO I 'm very sorry . Ma'am , I 'm not looking for your sympathy . I 'm only telling you this because I feel I owe you an explanation for my behaviour . Your explanation is accepted . You have n't heard it yet . Dr Soong 's a decent man and I wanted to help reunite him with his family . He 's a man that DOES deserve to have a child . Derelict vessel is stationary . Range , 1,000 yards . Fishing vessel on my port bow , this is Australian warship . Channel 1-6 . Pretty average up close , though , right ? Very average . FAIDEX , X . Do you hear there ? XO speaking . We have n't been able to raise the adrift vessel . We 're going to investigate whether assistance is required . Hands to FAIDEX stations . Hands to FAIDEX stations . That derelict fishing boat looks kind of familiar , sir . It certainly does . It belongs to your fishing mates . X - Ray 2 , this is Charlie 2 . What have we got ? Over . There 's no sign of the two fishermen . And the boat - it 's been ransacked . Ransacked ? Yeah . Totally cleaned out . Fairly suspicious , would n't you say ? X . Console 's a mess . GPS , radar , fish-finder , sat phone all ripped out of their housings . What do you reckon ? Pirates ? What , in these waters ? Anything 's possible . X ! You need to see this . Unless this Carl bloke had something to do with it . It 's crap , ET . You saw them . They were mates . I was below when they rocked up . I did n't see anything . How well do you know these guys , Spider ? Oh , apart from yesterday , I 'd only met them the once , on Bright Island . But they seemed like pretty cool dudes . Yeah , well , look , you know , we do n't know what happened on that boat . They could have taken Carl with them , as a hostage or something . Well , ca n't we keep searching , instead of going after this container ship , Buff ? No . The feds ' jurisdiction now , mate . We 've got our own job to do . We conducted a handover of the boat to the Federal Police . Uh , what 's your current status ? We 're on a sou ' - westerly course to intercept the second vessel of interest . OK . We 've had no luck in the Arafura Sea . Getting a lot of stick from Canberra . Just keep me informed . Will do , sir . And if there 's any news from the feds on Carl Davies , I 'd appreciate it if you pass it on . Roger , mate . Contact is still bearing 2-1-5 . Speed , steady at 12 knots . Range , 10 nautical miles . Would you like me to try and raise them , sir ? Negative , X . I do n't want them picking up steam . Us , on the other hand - increase 24 . Revolutions , 8-8-0 . I have a visual right ahead . Target 's picked up speed . She 's now on a course of 2-0-5 . Speed , 15 knots . That 'll be her top speed . Port 10 . Steer 2-0-0 . Stop . Heave to . I intend to board you . Course 2-0-0 , sir . Very good . ' Prins Alexander ' this is Australian warship . Stop . Heave to ... ' Prins Alexander ' , You have NO permission to come aboard ! NO permission ! That 's what he thinks . Make sure the gunner 's visible . Aye , sir . Gunner of the watch , stand to . Trading vessel on my port bow . You should stop , heave to . We intend to board you . ' Prins Alexander ' stop , heave to , or I will fire upon you . Nil response , sir . Recommend burst of fire ahead of the bow . Roger . One short burst ahead of the bow . Gunner , action ! Instant . One burst of 3-5 rounds , 50 yards ahead of the bow engage ! Check , check , check ! Take a snatch party , X . Aye , sir . Request to be part of that snatch party , sir . Get off my ship ! You 've no right to board me ! Sir ! Sir , stop right there ! Calm down , please , sir . I 'm Lieutenant McGregor from Australian warship ' Hammersley ' You are in Australia 's Contiguous Zone . I have EVERY right to board you . Charlie 2 , this is X-Ray 2 . We have the vessel under control . Low threat . We 're commencing our search now . Over . Roger , X . Charlie 2 out . Buffer . Sir , we would like to inspect your ship 's manifest . Would you send one of your crew to retrieve it , please ? Sir ? Your last port of call was Denpasar . Three days ago . Correct ? We pick up furniture . All the paperwork 's all there . It 's no problem . All the containers are accounted for . Serial numbers match up . Does n't seem to be any discrepancies there , ma'am . Hey , Buffer . Could these have been doctored ? Maybe , X . This is X-Ray 2 . The containers would appear to be legitimate and all accounted for . Over . What 's your instinct tell you , X ? I know they 're here . Over . Roger . Out . Buffer . I want everything out of this one . No ! You ca n't do this ! Spider ! Sir , step back ! Step back . There 's a false bulkhead here ! X ? Chefo ! Chefo ! Strippers . No strippers ! Come on . Strippers ! Chefo , there will be strippers . It 's not a buck 's turn , guys , alright ? If there 's gon na be strippers , I 'm staying right here . Jen would have my goolies , and you know it . Well , she 's not going to know . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! No strippers , alright ? Just a quiet night out on the town in celebration of Chefo 's engagement . Thank you , Charge . Oh , yes ! Thanks . Same again , thanks . Let me guess - rum , straight up . That 's what sailors drink , right ? Only at sea a hundred years ago . Now we drink ... House shiraz , love . Yeah . Let me . Thank you . Is , uh , this your local ? No , not usually . I 'm just looking for an audience to brag to about my big naval adventure . Adventure ? Ta . Hey , that was the highlight of my month . Might just be another standard day for you . Oh , sure , yeah - in amongst , uh , communist refugees , people-smugglers , murder on the high seas . Murder ? Yeah . A couple of fishermen . Their boat was ransacked . One dead , one missing . You can never be too careful out there . I 'll have to keep that in mind . Mmm . Come on . Let 's do it . Let 's go . Come on . Charge is in charge . Let 's go . It 'll be a good night , sir . Not tonight , Buff . Think I 'll have one quiet bevvy , then hit the sack early . Sir ! Alright . You know where we 'll be ! Have a good one . See you , sir . Where 's X ? At the bar , sir . Look after her , sir . Get you a drink , gorgeous ? Uh ... Uh ... no . I 'm right . Thank you ! 
@@5234441 When we completed interviews of all the refugees you brought back from Chulak , ten of them identified the final four symbols the Goa'ulds used to escape through the Chulak Stargate . When we disregard the last one as point- of- origin that leaves three to work with . Captain Carter 's computer model has thus far extrapolated only one set of symbols from the Abydos cartouche that contains these three glyphs . Let me guess ... that 's where we 're going . Very good , Colonel . Thank you , sir . I pride myself on my deductive reasoning skills . In one hour , you will go through the Gate to the planet represented by these symbols . It has been designated P3X- 797 . Could n't we call this planet something that 's a little easier to remember ? Uh , it 's based on a binary code the computer uses for extrapolation . Which makes it *much* easier to remember . We sent an M . A . L . P . probe through thirty minutes ago . Atmosphere is breathable , no detectable radiation , temperature approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit . Why no playback ? It appears to be very dark where the Gate resides on this planet . Well , the MALP probe has lights on it , does n't it ? We think they were ... broken during transport through the Gate . This is crazy ! We do n't know what could be there waiting for us when we come through . Do n't you worry , boys . That 's why the SG- 3 Marines are coming with . You can count on us to watch your backsides . Actually , it 's more my front side I was worried about . " Chevron four , encoded ! " " Chevron five , encoded ! " You 're late . Put these on . Does n't look like my prescription . " Chevron six , encoded ! " Thermal night- vision goggles . Hey , here 's a question - why does n't the MALP have a set of these ? " Chevron seven , locked ! " SG-1 and SG- 3 , you have a go ! Repeat , you have a go ! You watch our lovely backsides , remember ? Have it your way , flyboy . Are you out of your mind ? If Skaara or Sha 're are on the other side , those jarheads 'll open fire on them as soon as they see the light of their eyes ... if you know what I mean . You want that ? Give us ten count , then come on down ! One- one- thousand ... Two- one- thousand ... Fan out . Fire ! I 'm real glad it was you who took point ! No , I 'm okay . Thanks for asking . Everybody else ? I think so . What *were* those things ? I have n't the slightest idea . THE BROCA DIVIDE Johnson ! Daniel ! What are they ? Well , they do n't look completely Homo sapien . Uh , the larger brow ridge would imply Homo erectus , but then again , they 'd have canine teeth uh , they could be Australopithecus , but the brow ridge would be less prominent ... We have to stop him ! No , that 's - how prehistoric males probably had sex . Forcibly . The strongest male gets to mate ; that 's survival of the fittest . Well , I call it rape , and I think we should stop it ! Carter ! Where are those rocks coming from ? There ! Makepeace ! You and your men take the wide left flank . We 'll take the right . Copy ? Let 's go . Do n't move ! All right , hold your fire ! Lower your weapons ! They could be Goa'ulds . Just keep'em covered . There 's no entry scar . They 're not Goa'ulds . Lower your weapons , kids . Any idea what they are ? My lord , we are the Untouched . I am High Councillor Tuplo . We are pleased the gods have deemed us worthy of a return visit . Gods . Ah ... Only the gods come through the Stargate . I think they 're talking about us . Oh , for crying out loud , we 're not gods . Get up . Please . Perhaps they wish us to treat them as mortals . A test ? Please . Let us take you to the Land of Light . Love what they 've done with the place . I was going to do my living room like this , but ... it did n't go with my other stuff . Looks Minoan . Welcome . Please , come . Sit . Is she all right ? I do hope . She ... is my daughter . What 's her name ? She is called Melocia . I can only hope we rescued her in time from the hands of the Touched . We must now wait to see if she has been cursed by them . The creatures that took her - what were they , exactly ? They are the Touched . They were unfortunate enough to be cursed by the hilk'sha . Hilk'sha . There 's a word like that on Abydos . Pure evil , like wild animals . So these ... ' Touched ' people used to live here with you ? They were us ... until they changed . They became too dangerous and we were forced to banish them to the Land of the Dark . And where are these evil gods now ? Oh , they do not show themselves . We know only of their presence because of their actions . When was the last time the good gods came around ? Well , if *you* are not them , then it has been at least a generation . A generation . Okay ... um ... will you excuse us for a moment ? Ah , no ... please , no . Wait . Sounds like the Goa'ulds are n't here and have n't been for some time . That is my assessment as well . Daniel ? Carter ? I agree . In that case , gear up . We 'll move out in fifteen minutes ... well ... uh ... we should stay a while longer and study this society - learn how they 've evolved from a Minoan culture . I mean , you see those statues over there - those are bulls . The bull is all throughout Minoan culture and art , but we never really knew why . Hey , I 'm a big fan of all this stuff . But art appreciation is not what this mission is about . Get your gear together . Find anything ? Uh , no , sir . Yes , sir . Uh , actually , sir , we found a whole hell of a lot . Sir . Some beautiful decor , nice folks . Nothing of strategic importance , sir . All right , get cleaned up . Mission debriefing in half an hour . Yes , sir . I 'm sorry , sir , I know I 'm a guest at this party , but I have to protest . We should have stayed on that planet longer ; it was the perfect opportunity to study Minoan culture . Not to mention primitive man . This really is n't necessary , Doctor , as I 've already - Sir , would you let me finish , please ? Ok . Um , the people on the dark side are pre - Stone Age , but the people on the light side are clearly from the Bronze Age . So what better opportunity to study the Broca Divide ? The what ? Excuse me . The Broca Divide . Pierre Paul Broca was a 19th century anthropologist . He founded modern craniometry to study craniums and brains and to compare the divide in intelligence between early species of mankind . Fascinating . Should I start the debriefing , Sir ? That would be a good idea , Colonel . Now , just , just ... wait a minute ! Dr . Jackson , you 're wasting your breath . You 've already won the argument . He 's asked that we evaluate the scientific and cultural value of each mission from now on . Oh , for crying out loud . He has . That 's great ! Wonder how that thing in your gut would like his neck ripped in half ? Please release me , Lieutenant Johnson . Johnson ! Let him go ! Not until this *Goa'uld* apologizes . Lieutenant Johnson , take your seat now . No ! General , I would prefer to not hurt this man . What is your problem , Marine ? Take him to the infirmary . Tell them to keep him in restraints and check him out . So what do you think that was all about with Johnson ? Beats me . Maybe he was drunk . I do n't know . It did n't quite seem like inebriation . What the - - What the hell 's going on ? - I do n't know ! I did n't see anything ! We need medics , section C , stat ! Mmph ! Hey ! What the hell 's going on ? I want you . Why ? I mean , no ! Carter , this is a little out of line , do n't you think ? You want me ? No , no - not like this , not like - Carter ! What 's gotten into you ? It 's about time you saw a doctor , Doctor . Keep her from hurting herself until the sedatives take effect . Is this pretty much what Johnson has ? Oh , I 'd say so . And the other members of the team . This is the strangest thing I 've ever seen . Come on . Let 's take a look . We converted DEFCON- 1 living compartments from when this place was a missile silo into isolation chambers . You never know what you 're going to bring back through the Stargate . Notice the swelling of the brow ridge ? Some are even developing new follicle growth . Any idea what 's causing it ? Wish I knew . And it 's spreading . We got two more in an hour later . I 've never seen a behavioral disorder like this . All the victims are acting like animals . You think Carter has the same thing ? Mmm- hmm . The behavior fits . All the victims are behaving like primitives . Most female low- level primates tend to choose their sexual partners according to who would give them the strongest offspring . The leaders of the pack , or a tribe , were usually the prime choice . You should be flattered . Oh , yeah . I 'm honored . Jack ! There you are . Going on the Internet to do a little research on Australopithecus , and wow , what happened to you ? Oh , I - got in a little wrestling match with Carter . Why ? I guess she 's got whatever Johnson 's got . Had to drag her off to the infirmary . Oh . You ... poor man . No , it was n't like that . She was like a wild animal . She was nuts . Well , is she all right ? I should go see her . Why ? What do you mean , ' why ? ' Because I care about her . You care about her ? What 's that mean ? It means I care about her , she 's my friend . Now let - go ! She 's not yours to care about . What the hell are you talking about ? I 'm talking about Samantha . You just stay away from her , okay ? Okay , Jack . I think you should come with me to the infirmary , okay ? Just let go of me and - let go of my - Security ! Get in here ! Are you okay ? We 've managed to isolate an organism in the victims ' bloodstreams . That includes neurotransmitters . As they 're depleted , all but the most primitive parts of the brain seem to just ... shut down . That why they act like animals ? Actually , the organism seems to release a hormone that stimulates the primitive regions of the brain that are normally dormant . I .. I have never seen anything like this on Earth . Exactly . ' On Earth . ' That would explain the Touched . Beg your pardon ? That is what the primitives were called on P3X- 797 . The Touched . But I think , given recent events , I think it 's safe to say that they are n't born primitive , they must have this very contagious disease . And we came in contact with it , is n't that special ? So ... the question is , why have n't you and Mr . Teal'c come down with the symptoms ? Um ... Mr . Teal'c - Teal'c 's symbiote probably protects him . Jackson ? Well , that beats me . You 're the doctor , Doctor . Uh , maybe I have a natural immunity . Perhaps you will develop symptoms later . Thank you for the moral support . I am checking both of your blood for the presence of the organism , and I would bet that you both have it . This appears to be highly contagious . Are you saying we could have brought a new plague to this planet ? Yes , sir , that 's exactly what I 'm saying . Well , that 's it . I 'm ordering this mountain sealed off . No one comes in or goes out until we get a handle on this thing . He is going to damage himself . I 've been pumping him with sedatives to control him , but they wear off fast . Help me give him some more . Go , go ! Yes , sir , this is General Hammond . Sir , I 'm afraid I have a serious situation here . No , sir , I 've ordered the mountain sealed off , but I think you should order in an armed division to set up a second line of defense . Well , sir , my recommendation is that anyone attempting to leave the mountain should be shot on sight ... and the body burned . Good news , General . I could use some of that about now . What is it ? These gentlemen do n't appear to have the organism in their system . Now if we can just isolate why they 've been able to resist it . Perhaps we should ask the Untouched how they avoid contracting the disease . Maybe they know something we do n't . I could use a blood sample from one of the uninfected . Maybe they have something in their systems to protect them - something we can synthesize . All right . Either of you know how to draw blood ? Doctor , teach them . You go through in half an hour . Gear up . W- w- w- w- wait ! I do n't know anyone else who is ! Do not worry , Daniel Jackson . The Touched were easily frightened by your loud Earth weapons . We can easily subdue them . That 's easy for you to say . Teal'c ! It 's Melocia . She 's alive . It appears she is afflicted . So they just - dump her out here ? We dump them in a small room . To protect them . To protect everyone else . There is little difference . You know , you 're right ? They 're like lepers . And the dark side 's a leper colony . What is a leper ? Oh my God , never mind . We have to help her . Are you planning on helping me ? It is a long journey . We should leave her . No . No , let 's - go ! Teal'c ! Fire your weapon ! It will frighten them off ! Daniel Jackson ! Daniel ! Daniel Jackson ! Sorry , Colonel O'Neill , but your private room just became semi- private . We 've used the brigs , we 've used the temp quarters , some of the storage rooms . Doc ... doc ... Did you say something ? Give ... more ... What ? Give more what ? More ... An injection ? You mean you want more sedative ? You 've already had more than the maximum safe dosage , twice as much as anyone else because you 've been more violent . Give . No . It 's not safe . GIVE ! Give . Why are you so insistent ? Must have been in a lot of pain . Doocc ! Colonel O'Neill ? So you are still in there somewhere . Dream ... dream ? I 'm afraid not , Colonel , it 's very real . This is interesting ... sedative must knock back the primitive mind . Colonel , listen to me . I am not going to be able to keep you at this level for very long . It is too dangerous . It could cause permanent brain damage . Testosterone levels skyrocket , thus the aggressive behavior . It 's a histamine- alytic , which means it breaks down histamine . - Experiment . - Wha - - s Experiment . On ... me . Experiment on you ? No , sir , I ca n't do that . Use me . Welcome back , my Lord . Where are your friends ? My friends are ill because of this place . They have joined the Touched . They were cursed by the hilk'sha . It is not a curse . It is a disease . I lost my friend on the dark side of this planet . You must help me retrieve him . Why ? So he can give you the curse ? So he can give all of us the curse ? No , no ! He is better off where he is . He does not have the disease . He is immune . He is not cursed . Then by now , he is gone . He had your daughter with him . On the dark side . I have seen her . Help me retrieve her and my friend . She is among the Touched . She can no longer ... function amongst us . Therefore , she is dead . She is not dead . If I believed otherwise , do you not think I would help my own daughter ? Many of us have loved ones among the Touched . My own father is there . But we accept that we can not help them . Therefore , they are dead to us . How can you be so without heart ? I must ask you to leave . If you will not help me find my friend , then I must have a sample of your blood . Our blood ? Blood is our lifeforce . I assure you it will cause you no harm . I can not abide this ... *one* in my presence any longer ! You are not welcome here . When we return , I expect to find you gone . I am sorry . " Thank God you 're back . What happened to Captain Carter ? She was stabbed by her roommate . Do n't worry , it 's superficial , she 's going to be okay . We 've run out of space . We 've had to start doubling up on the iso rooms . I have retrieved the blood sample you requested . Good work , Mr . Teal'c . Colonel O'Neill . Teal'c ? I am afraid I lost Daniel Jackson on the dark side of the planet . I am sorry . Colonel O'Neill ? I think I might have something . I was examining the blood sample that Mr . Teal'c brought me , and then it hit me . There was very little histamine in it . If the people on that planet are human as you say , they have to have histamine in their blood . How does this help us ? Well , as I said before , this microbe is a histamine- alytic . It feeds on histamine . I do not understand . It is the Untouched that become the Touched . If they have none of the substance of which you speak , why then do some of them change ? Because only some of them have this low histamine level - which means that there 's probably a naturally occurring antihistamine in their diets . The ones who do n't eat it eventually contract the organism . Which is what gave me an idea . I checked the files . Both Dr . Jackson and I have acute rhenitis caused by severe allergies . Explain . I take strong antihistamines every day . So did Dr . Jackson . I have no histamine for the microbe to feed on . Just like the Untouched , the organism starves in my body . Does this mean you have a cure ? We have to try mega- doses of chloropheniramine malleate on someone and see if it works . Me . I thought you might say that . Now all we can do is wait . You 'd better lock him up again . Teal'c ! Doc ! Open the door ! Teal'c ! Colonel O'Neill ? Lucy , I 'm ho- ome ! I am not Lucy . I know that . It 's a reference to an old TV . Never mind . Open the door . I will summon the doctor . No , come on . I 'm fine . I 'm back to being myself . Just open up . I can not be certain that you are back to being yourself . You referred to me as'Lucy . ' Oh , for crying out loud , will you just open the door ? This stuff works . Let 's find Doc . Chevron three , encoded ! Chevron four , encoded . The guns are loaded with tranquilizer darts filled with chloropheniramine . Now a direct hit on a Touched man or woman should knock them out long enough in order to starve the disease . Good luck . Thanks , Doc . We 'll leave the rest for the Untouched . You think he 's still alive ? " Chevron seven , locked ! " Let 's find out . Guess the antihistamine wore off . Daniel , you dog . Keep this up , you 'll have a girl on every planet . Just let me give him an injection . What are you doing ? You must not bring the Touched among us ! Leave now . Just hear us out , please ? We found a cure . And we can bring back Melocia . And your father . Put him in the isolation circle . We will hear you . Let him pass . If you are not gods , how did you destroy the curse ? As we 've been saying , Tuplo , it 's not a curse . It 's a disease . A sickness . Jack ! There 's our boy . Where are we ? The light side of P3X- 797 . I thought we were going to give it a better name ... lift the curse . Huh ! If you are not gods ... Come out there with us . We 'll show you . Father ! Oh , oh ... You have done it , my lord . Thank you . We 'll teach you how to take care of the rest . Uh , sir ? Yeah ? About my earlier behavior ... I was n't myself , and-Oh , Carter , I do n't even remember your earlier behavior . You do n't ? No , I was infected too , remember ? Right ! Good , I 'm - I 'm glad . By the way , how 's the wound ? Wound ? I understand you got stabbed in the stomach ? Oh , yeah , that - that was nothing . With any luck , there wo n't even be a scar . Well , good . I was concerned . You were ? Sure . If it does n't heal properly , you 'll never wear that sweet little tank top number again . Sincroniza . o por IceMan01

I 'd sure like to check that out . As much as you guys duck practice , I ca n't see why you 'd want to test your skills against those robots . Hey , we pull our fair share , Leonardo . Maybe more than you think . MAN : There are three main zones here at Combat Land : The Shogun Zone , where you can test your martial arts mastery against samurais and ninjas , the Medieval Zone , where you can pit your metal against valiant knights and the Future Zone , where we are now , where it 's your job to clean up the streets of these cyber warriors . It all sounds awfully dangerous . Not at all . These robots would blow a circuit before they 'd harm anyone . Yes , but , uh , do n't you have any , uh , you know , nice rides ? Ah , for non-combatants . We have this boat ride , which travels between the various zones . This story will generate a lot of publicity for tomorrow 's grand opening . Actually , the park may not open tomorrow . The robots have n't been fully tested yet . Why not ? I have n't found anyone with the combat skills to give them a thorough workout . April , if the park does n't open tomorrow , there goes your story . Um , Mr . Stressbar , I think I know some guys who could give your robots a super workout . Yes ? MICHELANGELO : All right , now for some serious sci-fi and scarfing . You guys should be practicing . Hey , did n't we just get through kicking nerds out of the sewers ? But have n't you noticed we 've been doing a lot of that lately ? You know , he 's right . Yeah . That 's probably coincidence . Yeah . What jerkazoid in his right mind would wan na to sabotage the sewers ?  APRIL : Guys , it 's April . The new Combat Land amusement park is opening . How would you like to be the first guests ? Would we ? Whoa , we 're there .  You do n't wan na practice , but you do wan na go fight robots . Fine . This is n't practice , Leonardo , this is fun . APRIL : This is Horatio Stressbar , the developer of Combat Land . And this is Denton Nulcet , our chief robotics engineer . Hello . Oh , dear , forgive me . I 'm afraid you 're going to have to give us those weapons . Our ninja code wo n't let us surrender our weapons . Tsk , tsk . That 's a pity , because our safety code does n't permit real weapons in Combat Land . Whoa , looks like we got no choice , dudes . Great . April , I do n't like this . The turtles should not be giving up their weapons . Irma , you 're just being a worrywart . I 'm telling you , there 's a real story going on here . I 'm going to get the other minicam and find it . I 'm going to the Shogun Zone for some good old-fashioned ninja action . Who 's with me ? Sorry , dude . I wan na nail some knights in the Medieval Zone . And Raphael and I wan na check out the Future Zone . But do n't you wan na get in touch with our ninja heritage ? Oh , please . Why dwell in the past when you can explore the future ? Fine . I do n't need your help anyway . In fact , I 'll do better without you .  Dishonorable dog . You dare challenge our shogun ? I 'd like to see the other guys beat that score .  Ah , these robots are wimps . But you will never defeat the shogun . Boy , this guy 's good . Yeah ! Oh , no , they 've got us cornered . How 's this for some fancy shooting , huh ?  The humans are defeating us . The cyber leader will destroy them . So the last two humans left alive .  We ai n't human , bub . He 's programmed to say that . Soon there will be no humans , only we cyber warriors . NULCET : Oh , my , these turtles are good . But my robots are better .  Golden mongoose . I knew there was something strange going on here . Golden mongoose . I said , golden mongoose . Have you completely lost your mind ? STRESSBAR : These reporters are taking their job too seriously . They must be dealt with . Now , this is just my speed . A nice , non-violent ride . Hey !  How about you , and all that Middle Ages-type stuff ? Whoa , these dudes are pushovers .  Hey , you 're not supposed to have real weapons .  Where did you dudes come from ? Hey , what 's going on here ? Suddenly , this amusement park is n't so amusing . Oh , man , this is the weirdest theme park attraction I 've ever seen . COMPUTER : Analysis of subject complete . Thank you . Commence robotic duplication . You may release him . Well , this turtle is taken on .  Going somewhere ? Terrific . The Revenge of the Nerds Part 9 . Boy , those robots can really fight . I 'll say . It was like me and Raphael were in the middle of a science-fiction movie . Hey , have you guys seen Irma or Vernon ? No . And where 's Michelangelo ? Maybe he 's still in the Medieval Zone . DONATELLO : Gee , there 's no sign of him anywhere . He 's got ta be around here somewhere . Now I 'm starting to get worried . Relax , Leonardo , it 's a big park . They could be anywhere . Hey , wait up ! Will you knock it off ? Oh , boy , am I glad to see you guys . Irma , where have you been ? We thought something happened to you . I was doing some investigating on my own , okay ? I saw something really weird a little while ago . What was it ? I saw some guy approach a door behind this castle . And when he said -- Whoa ! APRIL : Irma ! Something is very wrong here . So how are we gon na stop them ? We only have these stupid fake weapons . Guys ! Behind you !  Oh , what in the world 's going to become of me ? Vernon . They got you too , huh ? I 'm going to be trapped here for the rest of my life . I just know it .  Uh , so , Vernon , uh , you seem to be cracking under the strain of captivity . Is this correct ? What utter nonsense . I could tear down that door with my bare hands . But it 's ... too much bother . STRESSBAR : Cut out that talk . I 've got my eye on you . Ah ! Yes , sir ! I 'm beginning to get the feeling this whole thing was a trap . Well , how are we gon na stop these mechanized maniacs ? LEONARDO : We 'll just have to improvise . Come on , Donatello . As Michelangelo would say , uh , if he were here , cowabunga ! How about you ? Gesundheit . WHOOPS ,     I hate to say it , but these robots do n't have many weak spots . Yeah , I 'm barely putting a dent in them . We better run for it , guys . That ought to hold those guys off . LEONARDO : Yeah , they seem to be interested in something in the city . RAPHAEL : Oh , perfect ! Excuse me , does anyone have the slightest idea of what 's going on ? Uh-huh . But whatever it is , it 's big . The first of the duplicate turtles is complete . I 'll throw the original in with the other prisoners . STRESSBAR : Excellent . He 's a perfect duplicate in every detail . And now I can use him to trap the rest of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and keep them out of the sewers forever . LEONARDO : Donatello , you try to stop the robots . I 'm gon na find Michelangelo and the others . If they really have captured Michelangelo , they 're probably keeping him in the infrastructure under the park . I 'm on my way . I do n't see a lock . Ha , not even a door handle .  Michelangelo , come in . Donatello , do you read me ?  Oh , something must be jamming our frequency . The shogun .    All the ninja skill in the world is n't gon na stop those robots .  What I really need is -- Is the other fellas . Michelangelo ! Oh , buddy , am I glad to see you . Uh , Michelangelo ?  Michelangelo ! What are you doing ? RAPHAEL : We better follow them on foot . April , go see what you can dig up on Horatio Stressbar . He 's got ta be the mastermind behind this . Okay , I 'll check the newsroom files .   Hey , what 's with these black boxes they have on their chests ? DONATELLO : I 'm not sure , but they look frighteningly like timer devices . RAPHAEL : Whoa !  Jeez , these guys are built like tanks . Hey , it stopped . Great . Now all we need is another hundred or so trash barrels and we can stop the rest of them . Let 's see if he 'll start again if I remove it . Look ! They 're heading into the sewers . DONATELLO : Those robots are walking time bombs . Yeah , and they 're gon na blow up the sewers . We 've got ta get to the lair . Come on .  The second turtle has been duplicated . And the explosive robots are heading into the sewers . And when they 've blown the sewers to pieces , the city will have to give me the contract to repair them . Twenty million in cash . Up front ! You ca n't sell your services unless you create a demand for them . NULCET : And with the turtles out of the way , the sewers will be just the beginning . I can use my robots to sabotage bridges , knock down buildings , wreck the subways . We 'll have every major contract in the city . We 'll make billions !  Okay , I got our spare weapons .  APRIL : Guys , I 've got something . Yeah , so , what 's so strange about that ? The sewers are in perfect condition . They do n't need reconstruction . They will when those bombs go off . Then Stressbar must have been behind all those sabotage attempts we thwarted . He 's trying to get a fat QC construction contract by blowing up the sewers . I would call that a slightly unethical business practice , would n't you ? Oh , man , those robots are everywhere . How are we gon na stop them ? Like this . RAPHAEL : They 're all leaving the sewers . How 'd you do that ? Oh , simple . Remember how that one robot stopped when I put a trash can on its head ? Yeah , I just saw it the flashback . Well , that tipped me off that the robots were being controlled by radio waves from the park . The metal in the can interfered with the transmission . Well , that 's swell , Donatello , but our friends are there . We got ta get them out . Yeah , and we 've got ta shut down the park 's master control . When those robots get near it , its signal will override my controller . Okay , okay , fine . We can chat about it later . Let 's go . VERNON : Some superheroes . You ca n't even get us out of a locked room . Would you cork it ? We 're doing the best we can . I have yet to see a door in this place that has a simple handle . Oh , that 's because they 're all voice-activated . What ? What ? Sure . I got it right here on tape .  Golden mongoose . IRMA : But you may as well forget it . Because I think the doors are programmed to respond only to the people that work here . But Irma , you 've got one of the voices on tape . And this time , pump up the volume .  NERD : Golden mongoose . Merciful heavens ! We 're free ! Where the blazes can those other two turtles be ? There . DONATELLO : Come on . They 've got ta be around here somewhere Leonardo ! Michelangelo ! You 're free ! Have you seen Irma and Vernon ? Uh , cat got your tongue ?    They 're robots !  Oh , he looks too much like Michelangelo . I ca n't do it . Well , I can , amigo . Cowabunga ! LEONARDO : Hang on , Donatello . Boy , this is weird . Leonardo , catch ! Something 's happened with the explosive robots . We lost contact with them . You 've got to re-establish contact . Boost the transmitter power .  The turtle robots ? What are they doing here ? Why have n't they captured the other two turtles like they were supposed to ? We could be experiencing a total robotic malfunction . Surprise , cheese head !  You lousy turtles ! You 're not gon na mess up my plans again ! I ca n't tell which one of these gizmos controls the robots . Well , guess I 'll have to use the process of elimination DONATELLO : Come on , we 're almost in the clear . Yeah , as long as we do n't run into any ... robots ? IRMA : They got us cornered . Guys , this may be it . We 're doomed ! This had better be it .  Oh ! Leonardo and Michelangelo did it . The robots are shut down . Yeah , but they 're not . This park is about to have the biggest fireworks show in history .   .  LEONARDO : I owe you all a major apology . You do n't need to practice more . Your skills are awesome just the way they are . No , no , dude . You were right . Yeah . So , what do you say ? Let 's head to the old practice room and have a real workout . Are you nuts ? After all we 've been through today , I wan na relax and check out these Ratzilla movies . Well , then , so , what 'll it be , dudes ? Practice or goofing off ? I-- I think goofing off -- Goofing off . Yeah , me too , pretty much .

I 'm gon na need stitches . - Is he gon na be all right ? - Yeah , I 'll be fine . TY : Do you think We 're gon na find this guy ? I do n't know . I do n't understand Why they think he 's down here . Because this is the direction they were coming from . Could 've been in Queens , coming over the Triborough . They could 've been in Westchester , got off the FDR . Anything 's possible . This is stupid . This is stupid . This is like needle-in-a-haystack stupidity right now . You 're preaching to the choir , Davis . Guy in the blue suit , shiny shoes , answers to " Special Agent In Charge . Okay . Hold on . Hold on . Give me that shovel . Oh !  Definitely buried longer than a day . WOMAN  : Central to 55 Charlie . Lieutenant requests you return to the house . - Five-five Charlie . What 's up ? - Personal matter , Charlie . - Five-five Charlie . On my way . - Lucky you . Dig around out here long enough , Bosco , you might find Jimmy Hoffa . I thought all parrots talked . JOLIE : Walter 's a cockatoo . A lot of people mix them up . CARLOS : Oh , jeez . We can always call Animal Services . No . That could take hours . We got ta get this guy to the ER . CARLOS : Man . JOLIE : You know , he 's fine if you just keep feeding him . He craps in there , I ai n't cleaning it up . Yeah , I understand . It 's none of my business . - I did n't go over today . - I do n't know what I was thinking . You do that a lot . - What ? - Criticize me and then take it back like you were n't gon na say anything , but truth just came out . - I do that ? - Yeah , you do . Oh . Okay . I think you 're making a fool of yourself . I think it 's pathetic . And I think it 's a terrible thing to do to Joey . That 's what I think . Who asked you what you think ? I could give a damn about what you think . I 'm not so attached to my mom I ca n't have a relationship ... - ... for more than six weeks . - Hold up . You can dish it out ... - ... but you ca n't take it ? - Stop the bus ! - Okay , okay . - Back up . I Saw something in the alley . Okay , stop . See that in the alley ? Hey ! Hello . Hey !

Your mommy and daddy around ? Mommy and Daddy here ? What about your name ? You know your name ? Come on , buddy . What 's your name ? - An attack parrot . - Something out of Hitchcock . - It 's not funny . Ouch ! - It 's pretty funny . - How does it look ? DANA : He 's gon na need stitches . CARLOS : See ? DANA : So where 's the killer parrot now ? - It 's a cockatoo . Locked in the bus . - Ouch ! - Will you stop being such a baby . Just wait till Montville gets here . - Any news on that kidnapping ? - Oh , the buried guy ? No . We 've been watching TV all afternoon . He 's 72 with a pacemaker . Six grandchildren . They interviewed his wife on camera . She was crying the whole time . - What do we got ? DANA : Scalp lac . Lean forward for me . One percent width ... . Okay . Wait , wait , wait . Oh ! Oh ! Jeez . You guys bring in that bum With pneumonia ? Hector . Yeah .  Yeah , he died . Set up a suture kit , 4-0 nylon . Man . where the hell did that guy train ? Baghdad ? - Be thankful you did n't need a rectal . - Man . Now what do we do with Walter ? Why do n't we just drive it over to the shelter , let them deal with it ? - I 'm not getting back in with that thing . How could she just wander off ? She 's 87 years old ! It takes a half an hour to make it to the television room ! Look , I understand you 're upset , but this is not a jail . We do n't have enough staff to supervise every single patient . And your mother 's Alzheimer 's is progressing rapidly . She ca n't have gone far . I 'm sure the staff Will find her . I 'll call you every five minutes . If you find her first , great . May I come ? Get in . He 's staring at us . He 's fine . - He 's got that look . - What look ? That  look . Hey , what do you think Will happen to him at the shelter ? Some kid will probably adopt him . Be right back . Hey .  - Parrot 's in the back ? - Cockatoo . Lots of people mix them up . - He do that to your head ? - Yeah . You little son of a bitch . DOC : That it ? - That 's it . You need us to sign some paperwork or something ? Nope . What 'll happen to him ? Well , he attacked a city employee . That means he gets put out .  No . No ! Open it ! No ! No ! No ! No ! HELLER : You okay ? You look flushed . Yeah . It 's a sunburn . I 've been working outside today . I 'm afraid your mother 's probably gon na need to be in a more secured unit . And with her declining mental status , she 's not aware of her surroundings . How much ? It 's gon na cost more , right ? - Around a hundred and fifty . - A day ? - Medicaid pay for it ? - No . Nice little profit center , is n't it ? I guess it might be if we had a secured unit . Sorry . Okay . Let 's take the shirt off . Hey , it 's okay . It 's okay . Come on . No ? Water 's ready . All right . Guess I 'm gon na go first . Water looks good too . And if you 're not coming , that 's your problem . Let 's go . Shirt off . All right . Guess I 'm going in by myself . All right . Good job . Let 's take these smelly shoes off . Sheila gave up a banana and I found some peanut butter . You ready to get wet ? All right ? Oh , you 're heavy . I called Family Services and pediatric psych are on the way . Okay , thanks . Okay . Let 's see ... . - So this guy is straight and single ? - Mm-hm . All right . It 's okay , buddy . It 's all right . Okay ? Okay . Okay . Okay . Mom ? Mom ! You 've got your nightgown on , Mom . You ca n't go out with your nightgown on . Her hands are freezing . I think we need to get you home , Irene . Is that okay ? Gabe , get the door , please . SULLY : Come on , it 's okay . Here we go . Can I take her back in my car ? - Sure . You know the way ? - No . - Well , you can follow us . - Okay . We 're gon na get you home , Mom , so we can get you warm . You scared me . That was a day well-spent . We 'll be back out here tomorrow . I promise you that . The guy 's probably dead anyway . Shot him , buried him . They grab the ransom and run . That 's what I 'd do . FAITH : There 's your dogs , Bos . BOSCO : It 's about time . That 's where " saved by the bell " comes from . - No kidding ? TY : Yeah . I mean , could you imagine being out there just buried for more than a day not knowing if you 're gon na be found or just-- What do you think 's going through his mind ? " Damn , I could have had a V8 " ? You 're a sick puppy , Bos . You know that ?  No ! Stop it , please ! No ! No ! No ! Stop ! Please stop ! Oh , Mom . Mom ! Mom . She used to love to go for walks in Central Park . Every day until the Alzheimer 's . Seventy-five-years old and she was still out there doing two miles a day in her tennis shoes . She knew every inch of that park . Can I take her home , take care of her myself ? It 'd be very difficult . She needs 24-hour-a-day care . I feel like a terrible son . You 're here . Lots of people , they just dump them off never come back to see them . But I promised that I would take care of her make sure that she was safe , never alone . It 's so strange . When I look at her , I see my mother . She looks back and she ca n't see me . Maybe he does n't understand English ? I tried Spanish . But he did n't respond . MONTVILLE : Scrapes and bruises . Some lice . Couple of small bites , probably from rats . But no signs of physical abuse . What would you call leaving a kid on the streets ? Neglect . He 's malnourished and dehydrated . But nothing a meal and some apple juice wo n't fix . Family Services been here yet ? No . And a lot of shooting galleries over there . I hope somebody does show up so the cops can arrest them for child abandonment . Sleepy , huh ? Good night , little guy . Good luck . When I was a kid , my dad took me to a Yankee game . Righetti pitched a no-hitter against the Red Sox . Fourth of July . It was awesome . We got separated on the subway on the way home . I ended up in Brooklyn . Dark , raining . I did n't know where I was . I 'll never forget that . Ca n't stay here all shift , you know . Just wait till Social Services gets here , okay ? He should n't have to be alone anymore today . I 'm gon na get some coffee in the lounge .  - We 're closed . - Yeah . Yeah , look , remember me from this afternoon ? The cockatoo . It was just protecting his owner . He was dying and we were tearing his clothes off ... - ... and putting all this stuff on his chest . - You 're too late . Right . - Look , I 'm sorry to bother you . - Your friend already took him . - My friend ? - Spanish dude . CARLOS : Can you say " cracker " ? Can you say " cracker " ? Come here . Come here . Cracker ? Can you say " cracker " ? Hello .  Hello . Hey , Walter .  Anybody hear if they identified that woman we found buried today ? M.E . said she 'd been in the ground for weeks . No ID . We 're checking missing persons , hoping to find a match . Pretty much rule out suicide . - Hey , what are you doing here , Sull ? SULLY : Came back for my civvies . TY : She was n't hurt or anything ? - No . - Must be a relief . - Yeah . BOSCO : Hey . Marcantonio , what 's up ? Kidnapper just woke up in the hospital , told us where they buried that guy . Okay , hold on . Hold on . Stop digging . Find the corners , guys . Find the corners . Take it easy . Take it easy . Take it easy . Okay , give me a crowbar . Okay . Typical . Look at where we are . Feds had us half a mile uptown all day . TY : I do n't know if I could last being buried like that . Something about everything being over you . No way out . The weight of it all , you know ? Damn . Want to get something to eat ?  Sully ? You want to get something to eat ? - What ? No hot date tonight ? - I 'll cancel it . No , thanks . All right . As opposed to what ? Your usual bright and cheerful demeanor ? - Chelsea Square ? - No . How about some Thai food ? - At midnight ? - Yeah . Live a little . Yeah . Yeah . 
@@5235141 MAGGIE : I do n't have a problem with two men dancing together . Yeah , me neither . If the guy asked me , I would ... I 'm confused . Those were men ? That 's right . But they were dressed in womers clothing . Some guys just like to dress up like women . I mean , it 's ... Well , they sort of ... Well , it 's a lifestyle thing .  Yeah . It makes them feel pretty . They were pretty . Keep sliding with us , I guarantee you 'll see a lot stranger things . Do n't you ever get tired of it ? I mean , one dangerous place after another ? Do n't you ever just wan na find a nice place and just stay ? MAN : Hey ! QUINN : All the time ... What is this ? New York World ? Are you nuts ? Get off the street , it 's gon na rain ! Looks like we 're in for a little sprinkle .  WOMAN : Come on , you guys , hurry up . I 've never seen folks so skittish about a little rain before . Well , maybe this is Killer Lightning World .  Flash flood ...  It stings like lye !  Acid Rain World ! If we do n't get inside pronto , there 's gon na be nothing left but bones . Actually , even a moderately strong acid rain would easily dissolve human bone , I 've heard .   Did anyone catch the weather report today ? Yeah , sure . Sulfuric thunderstorms tapering off to a light hydrochloric sprinkle in the afternoon .  You should have worn your rubbers . Oh , my gosh ! Are you folks all right ? Didrt you hear the weather report ? Oh , I 'm sorry , we must 've missed it . Oh , well , you must be from out of town . We 're from Canada .  Well , we never go out without checking the weather first . We 're freeway close to all the major theme parks , we accept travel club discounts and , lucky for you , we just happen to have a few vacancies . So let me get your bags .  Excuse me . Excuse me . Where are you going ? What 's wrong ? Anywhere but here , out of my way . You need more towels . Please , do n't go . It 's raining outside ! I 'd rather be staked out in a typhoon in my birthday suit than spend another second in this madhouse ! So , how about a suite ?  Room rates . QUINN . : What if you found a portal to a parallel universe ? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it 's the same year and you 're the same person , but everything else is different ? And what if you ca n't find your way home ? ETHEREAL VOICE . : Sliders .  This is the presidential suite . Why were those people leaving ? People ? In the lobby .  Well , you see , the Chandler is a very unique vacation experience . Not everyone can handle so much pampering and relaxation . All those people ran out into an acid rainstorm because the room service is just too good ?  You ... Anyway , we have all the major amenities . Rain slickers embroidered with the distinctive Chandler logo , decontamination shower stalls , emergency eye wash , and complimentary assortment of burn ointments .  Well , if you need anything else at all , feel free to just call the front desk . Thank you . And that is for you . Thank you , sir . That woman should seriously consider decaf . Well , at least we have a roof over our heads until we slide . Which is in 12 hours . REMBRANDT : Just make sure we leave a wake-up call . Well , it 's too early to crash . Why not ? You wan na come , bro ? Yo , farm boy , you wan na chill with us at the bar ? No . I 'm quite happy with the temperature up here . Thanks . No , no , no . " Chill " means to just hang out . You know , be mellow . Oh , I see . No , I think I 'll just crash . You know , see what programs are being transmitted tonight .  Check out the Spice Channel . WOMAN 1 . : Next week on the Spice Channel ... There 's a channel on spices . You can call me when it 's hot , fast and fresh . Interesting . MAN . :  Pizza man . WOMAN 2 . : Mmm . I 'm so hungry . Hey , I ordered this with sausage . Extra toppings , huh ? I can handle that .  WOMAN 1 . : Pizza Man , next week on the Spice Channel . Your folks wanted you both to be together . I do n't even know him . You did n't know me . You did n't know Remmy .  I know . Hey , if you guys ever want to call it quits . I mean , if you find a nice , peaceful world and you want to settle down , it 's okay with me . It wo n't be home , but we 've been to a few that were close enough . I just wanted you guys to know that .  Are you saying that you do n't want us to meet your parents ?  So , can I get you folks anything ? I will have a draft . Make it two . I 'm feeling original . Make mine the same . Three drafts coming up . So , some weather we 're having , huh ? Yeah . Hey , were you guys around back in ' 93 when Santa Monica Bay caught fire ? It 's this dang El Ni ? o . Pushes in those petrochemicals right in off the ocean .  Oh , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . Did you guys want oysters in those ?   ... alive ! It 's alive ! Henry , in the name of God ! FRANKENSTEIN . ## In the name of God ! Now I know what it ...   Hello . What are you doing here ?  Hey ? Hey , where are you going ? Who are you ? Hey , wait . Wait . It 's okay . I wo n't hurt you .  I do n't understand . Whoa . Seems a little slow tonight , huh ? Hey , stick around till Wednesday . Karaoke . There was someone in our room . MAGGIE : What ? What are you talking about ? A boy . Only he wasn't really there . He appeared . He grabbed the TV thingy and walked through a closed door like some kind of ... Of ... Non-corporeal shade . Are you saying you saw a ghost ? Colin , what were you watching on TV ? A program about this medical pioneer . He created a living creature by stitching together parts of corpses . Amazing . Though in the end , I gather it got a little out of hand . Sounds like Frankenstein . That 's him . MAGGIE : Okay , Colin . You were really wiped , maybe you just fell asleep in front of the TV .  You think I dreamed this ? Hey , man , you 've been traveling a lot . You 're tired . We better get him a drink , and make it a stiff one . Same as you , brother . And I know what I saw .  Welcome to the Chandler Hotel . We 're freeway close to all the major theme parks ... I have a few more trunks in the cab . I 'll take care of them . Right this way , sir . This is the second weirdest hotel I 've ever stayed in . Colin , I just want you to consider that there might be some other explanation for this . Like I 'm a ignorant , superstitious bumpkin . No . I was thinking more that you 're tired . You fall asleep watching an old horror movie , and ...  Do you think this is easy for me ? I spent my whole life trying to adjust to my own world , and now I 've got a million more to deal with . Nobody 's acting like a fool .       Quinn ! There was something invisible with me inside the bathroom ... There is a head in the ice machine and it had my face . ... and it wrote , " Help us , " on the mirror . This place is haunted . MAGGIE : Come on . Let 's go . Come on , Colin . I swear . I 'm not kidding you . There was a head in the ice machine . In there . It looked like you ? Well , it was blue and frosty , but yeah .  Well ? Have a look .  Okay . There was a head in there and it looked just like me . Well , since yours seems to be firmly attached , I really would not sweat it . All right . Do n't you blow me off . I know a disembodied head when I see one . No , but somebody could have written that anytime . When the mirror steamed up , those words just became visible again . There is nothing going on here that can not be explained by a bunch of tired people stuck in an old hotel with a Boris Karloff marathon on cable . Now , why do n't we get some rest ? We 've got an early slide in the morning . What time should we be ready ? In about 10 ... Hours . Where 's the timer ? It was right there . Nobody moved it ? That boy was in here . Now , what would a ghost want with a timer ? That weird guy from the lobby was snooping around outside . Fine . You check him out . I 'm gon na go talk to our host . Put some clothes on . " Put some clothes on . Oh , well , then let 's look in the lost and found . Ah , it was actually taken from our room . Has anyone been in there ? A maid ? Oh , no , no . I make up the rooms myself , and I have n't been in there since you checked in .  Well , then maybe you can help us find it . Oh , I 'm sorry . I ca n't leave the desk . But I thought this was a full-service hotel ? Well ... My sworn duty as concierge does obligate me to help my guests in any way possible . I promise you , there will be a big tip in it for you . Well , please , sir , the satisfaction of my guests is reward enough .  Yeah ? Can we talk to you for a second ? I 'm busy . We saw you snooping around our room . What are you looking for ? Leave me alone . You would n't happen to have seen a small electronic device lying around , would you ? About yea big , red , blinking numbers ? What would I be doing in your room ? Come on . Do n't touch that . Why do n't you tell us that ? What 's all the gear for ? I 'm doing meteorological experiments . Analyzing weather patterns and atmospheric contamination . You study the weather by sucking up dust bunnies ? I was collecting water and particulate samples off of people 's shoes . They tracked into the hotel . If that 's even any of your business . What 's your name ? Smith . John Smith . You expect us to believe that ? What kind of an idiot checks into a hotel using the alias of " John Smith " ? I realize it is not a very common name , you know , but that is no reason for you to be insulting . Well , he 's not lying . John Smith . Graduate student at Caltec .  What does this thing do ?  MAGGIE : Come on , guys . We should let Mr . Smith get back to work . Sorry we disturbed you . I think we should keep an eye on our Mr . Smith . We have n't seen anyone else come or go since the rain started . Yeah . Then the timer 's probably in the building somewhere . We 've got nine hours to turn this place upside down . Have you guys ever lost the timer before ? So , " to chill " is a good thing ? Oh , yeah , man . If you chill , that means you 're cool . Obviously if you were chilled , that means you 'd be cold . Well , see , it 's not about temperature . It 's about a state of mind . So , cool is good . So , if you 're too hot , that must be bad , right ? Well , both hot and bad are good .  Oh , great . What is this , a bad horror movie ?  What 's next ? Blood pouring out of the elevator , voodoo dolls chasing us with steak knives ? Oh , there 's a flashlight back here in every other world . Got you . Ow ! Yeah , that 's gon na leave a mark .   Who 's there ? Quinn ? Is that you ? Quinn ? Hello ? Sorry . This usually happens after the first storm . The rain eats right through the wires . How long have you been working here ? Oh , my husband and I bought the place six years ago . We always wanted to run our own hotel . He died two months after we opened the doors . I 'm sorry .  It was cancer . He worked for SoCal Oil and Gas , digging the San Fernando petro duct . We bought this place to get him out of that hole . Do you ever think about leaving ? Going someplace where there are n't so many ghosts ? Um ...  I still have a lot invested in this place . Oh , hey , I 've got it . Thanks . It 's nice having people stay at the hotel again . I spend a lot of time in hotels . It is n't easy having people just pass through your life . No point in getting attached though when checkout time is at 12:00 , right ? We ... We better keep looking . Anyone down here ?  Quinn , if that 's you , I swear I 'm gon na skin you alive .  Hey ! Hey , who 's out there ? Let me out of here ! Oh , man . This is the room the boy went into . I do n't care what your brother said . There is something paranormal going on here . " Paranormal . " Beyond normal . Yeah . Yeah , that sums things up nicely . Good idea . Rembrandt . Remmy . Do n't be afraid . My name 's Colin Mallory . What 's yours ?  I ca n't hear you . What are you trying to tell me ? Where did you come from ? Remmy . Remmy ? Paranormal .   REMBRANDT : Colin , I did n't get us a key , but I got us some light . Rembrandt , I saw the boy again . He opened the door . Hey , Colin ? I 'm right here . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm right here ! Colin ! BOY : Hi . He could n't see me . They ca n't . I can hear you . I can touch you . Sure . You 're on my side now . Your side . Am I ... Are we dead ? I do n't know . It 's pretty boring , whatever it is . You 're the first person who could see me , so I brought you on over . We can hang out now . Hang out . Sure . Play and stuff . The others are mean . I do n't go near them anymore . The others ?  Okay , rats , keep your distance because I am not having a good day .    Hey ! Maggie , it 's me . What took you so long ? Didrt you hear me yelling ? What happened ? I thought I saw someone . I followed them down here and then I got locked in .  And I could hear things . Like little animals , with little claws and little beady yellow eyes scurrying at my feet . Easy , girl . I thought you were a Marine . I do n't like rats . Come on . We go out this way .  Jeez . Any luck ? Maggie saw someone run into the cellar . I came down to find a key to room 315 . When I went back upstairs , he was gone . Look , 315 is the only room that does n't have a spare key behind the desk . Now , I thought you said that Smith was the only other person that was staying here ? He is . Well , then where 's that key ? I do n't know . I do n't understand it . Things are always getting lost in this place . Yeah , you 're telling us . Listen , lady , somebody stole our property , put a human head in the ice machine , locked me in a rat-infested cellar , and I do n't like rats , so do n't tell me this is all part of our unique vacation experience .  Sorry . What 's going on here ? It 's okay . You can tell us . Okay . It 's not really the off-season . Oh , well , actually every day around here is the off-season . You know , " Boo . " Bumps in the night . Blood-curdling screams . The whole ball of wax . Disembodied heads in the ice chest do n't exactly make for five-star ratings . I told you . So , why stay ? I mean , why not just pack up and go ? I ca n't . MAGGIE : Why not ? I have a son . Matthew . He 's ... He 's 10 . After my husband died , he 's all I had . All right , well ... What happened ? This is the last place I saw Matthew . That 's why I ca n't leave . This thing just appeared here two years ago . HOLLY : I do n't know what it is . I 've talked to police , scientists , psychics . The Air Force took over the hotel for almost a year , until even they got bored . I 'm supposed to call them if anything happens .  It must be stuck open somehow . REMBRANDT : You think Colin must have gone in ? Quinn .  So much for the " Do not disturb " sign . Where 's my brother ? What are you talking about ? What 's the forecast , Willard ? You always predict the weather with an EM scanner ? That is for lightning and atmospheric discharges . What are you doing here and what do you know about my son ? I ca n't stop her . Okay , okay . All right , you wan na know the truth ? I hunt ghosts . Ghosts . Yeah . I have a theory . That phenomena that are often attributed to the supernatural are actually a result of fluctuations in space-time . And what people see as ghosts ... No , no . They are actually visitors from alternate quantum realities . That 's a pretty good theory . And I believe that , that disturbance in room 315 ... I was trying to get some readings when I saw your friend fall in . And you did n't tell us ? I was getting around to it . All right . Here 's the deal . We 'll help you prove your theory , but you got ta help us first . SMITH : I was working on these portable nuclear power cells . Eventually , they cut off my funding at Caltec . They would n't let me use the fusion reactor anymore . Jerks . Oh , I put most of these detectors together in my garage . You built a nuclear reactor in your garage ? A little one .  Okay . All systems look nominal . How about a condensed version for the scientifically impaired ? Each alternate Earth has its own quantum signature . We should be able to adjust the equipment to amplify the quantum signal from that vortex upstairs . What will that do ?  Hey , bro . Look who I met . It worked ! Matthew . Mom ! That is quite correct . You seem a bit more sagacious than our own Mr . Mallory . Sod off , you brainy twit . Allow me to introduce my traveling companions . This is Quinn " Howling Man " Mallory , a singer of some sort I 'm told .  Get us the hell out of here REMBRANDT 2 : And this is Miss Maggie Beckett , exotic dancer . Hi . Are you responsible for opening the vortex upstairs ? REMBRANDT 2 : Yes , I was working on an antigravity machine when something went a bit awry . The resulting quantum disturbance sucked us into this ephemeral state . This is fantastic . You 've been here this whole time ? I knew about the disturbances , but I never ... You 're people .  We 've been trying to find someone to help us for like two years . You ... You 're a stripper ? No , love . Exotic dancer . Colin , you and Matthew must have nearly the same quantum signature . That 's why only you could see him . My thoughts precisely . Sorry I did n't believe you , bro . Never close your mind to the possibilities , brother . I 've missed you so much . I know . I could see you the whole time . I tried to tell you I was okay , but you could n't hear me . Look at you . You have n't changed at all . Do n't cry . Colin said his brother can get us out of here . Yeah . Well , he bloody well better , because we 've got your little timer , see ? And brainiac over here says that when these numbers run down , if you do n't have it back , you 're gon na be right up it . Yeah , baby . Sorry . Colirs extra mass must be destabilizing the vortex . Matthew ! No , we 're losing them . No , I do n't have enough power . COLIN . : Power the vortex . Frankenstein ! REMBRANDT : Where are they ? They 're here . They 're stuck in a transient state between this world and theirs . Yeah , but not for long . Aw , jeez , the instability is increasing . Look , an hour , maybe less , you know , we ... This whole entire vortex could collapse completely . What does that mean ? If the exotic matter holding the vortex open collapses , they 'll be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the wormhole . My sors still alive in there . You have to get him out . My brother 's in there , too , Holly . Believe me , we 'll do what we can . SMITH : We need more data . I have to get closer to the vortex to get some neutrino flux readings . Oh , my God . I thought you said the vortex was collapsing . No , I ... I said it was unstable . He said it was collapsing . What 's happening ? I think it 's generating more power to compensate for Colirs extra mass . You better do something before it eats the hotel . MAGGIE : Before it eats the whole planet . If we can tune your detector to the same quantum frequency as the vortex , maybe we can stabilize it . You want to stop that , with this ? This thing runs on four AA batteries . Hey , man , it 's a solid theory . We just need more power . Blackouts like this last for days . Colin was trying to tell us something about power . He said , " Frankenstein . " That does n't make any sense . Frankenstein ... Frankenstein ... Frankenstein !  REMBRANDT : Man , that rain stinks ! The cable 's hooked up . REMBRANDT : Okay . Sure it will . I 've adjusted your EM detector to emit a pulse to match their quantum signatures . Jeez , how could you possibly know that , that 's the right frequency ? Maggie told me . What ? Yeah . When you saw your double in the ice machine . The cold temperature must have slowed her molecular activity enough for her to materialize . So , now I 've adjusted the molecular resonance to simulate freezing temperatures . One jolt should be enough to reopen the vortex and knock them all loose . But you do not know that . God , you could destroy the vortex completely . What choice do we have ? Listen to me . You can not let him do this . I mean , if his calibrations are the tiniest bit off , he will crush your son into neutrons . All right . I 'm not gon na kid you . There is a risk involved . But if we do n't do something now ... Well , you may not get another chance . Look , they pulled my funding . They pulled my academic credentials . Look , my career is down the toilet . But this ... This proves that I was right . You know , and who do you think Caltec 's gon na call to study this thing , huh ? Me . I laid the groundwork , you know . I put in the hours . That 's my tenure .  He 's still breathing . Okay . What now ? It 's still set to the right frequency . But there 's no power . Not out here . Are you crazy ? Do n't worry . I 'll be right back . Quinn ! Hey , brother . You better watch where you step next time ! That 's the portal . It goes to your world ! Go ! Go ! Thank you , sir . Good luck . Bye , sweetie . Sorry , we did n't have more time , if you know what I mean . Yeah , baby . I told you we 'd be right back . Matthew !  Mom , not in front of everybody .   Where is it ? Oh , no . Sorry , Professor . Looks like it 's back to the drawing board . Maybe not . All the vortex data should be stored right in there . Oh . Oh , my .  That 'll keep them talking back at Caltec . Thank you . We had a little help from across the astral plane . I 'm bad . Thank you all . I ... Obviously all your rooms will be comped for as long as you 'd like to stay . We appreciate that , ma'am . But we 've got a lot of traveling to do . Yes . But you did promise a unique vacation experience . Tell all your friends . Listen . What ? It stopped raining .

Dunlap , every 90 minutes , a child dies in this country from gunshot wounds .

No , she 's in my room , Nick . Oh . No , it 's a good idea . Good thinking . Yeah . How are you doing , sweetheart ? I 'm fine . How about you ? Well , when it rains , it pours . They 're doing a , uh , earthquake retrofit on my apartment , so , uh , Nick and I are hoteling it for a couple of days . Oh , that 's silly , Nash . Why do n't you stay here ? Oh , that 's all right , sweetheart . Thanks anyway , but ...  Lisa ...   It 's okay .   : It 's okay . Somebody almost took our baby from us , Nash . I know . We almost lost her today . We almost lost her . I know . You know , you ... You ca n't stop every stupid accident from happening . No . No , you can't .  You know , here we are , waiting to hear from colleges , waiting to see if she 's accepted , you know , where she 's gon na go , the next stage of her life .  The next thing I know , the phone rings , and some stranger 's telling me my daughter 's been shot . It 's all right , baby .  God , Nash , what if she 'd ... Do n't even think it .  Hey . Come on in , Joe .  It 's okay . Sorry to bother you .  It 's okay , sweetheart , it 's all right . Here . Thank you . Hey , Lisa . How you holding up ? Oh , Joe , yeah , I 'm good , I 'm ... I 'll bet . Yeah . Uh , could I borrow him for a second ? Sure . Okay . Well , that , uh , Kid Print program paid off . Uh , the shooter 's name is Brian Van Pelt . His , uh , classmates voted him " most likely to succeed . " However , the principal pinned him as the " biggest pain in the butt . " What about the gun ? Yeah , well , they were part of a shipment that was hijacked last year on the way to some wholesalers in town . A couple of the guns have surfaced in felonies , and a couple more came up as evidence in that , uh , gang slaying in Potrero Projects last month . Did you get an address on the kid ? Russian Hill . The old lady 's loaded . Apparently , the house makes the Spreckel 's mansion look like a Tinkertoy set . Oh , hey , oh , I ... Put your hands on the table . Come on , Brad . Back off , boys , and stay where I can see you . Put your hands on the table . What 's going on here ? Stop this right now ! San Francisco Police Department , ma'am . Your son 's a suspect in a shooting . Well , we 'll see about that . You just wait right there until I call my lawyer .  I said wait ! Lady , your son 's under arrest for assault with a deadly weapon . Now , you get out of my way , or I 'm gon na take you down for obstructing justice . Is that clear ? It 's clear . Good . MAN : Morelli , where 's the report ? Joe ... Yeah . You want to take the young man on down to booking ? You got it . Keep walking . I 'm sure it was an accident . Let me talk to the parents , I 'll work it out . How much ? You got to be kidding me . I 'm talking about what 's best for your daughter . She gets nothing out of my son going to jail . I know the best plastic surgeons in the city . Whatever it takes , just give me a number . I 'm a rich woman , Inspector . Do n't be shy . A hundred million dollars would n't even begin to cover it . Now I 'm gon na suggest you put that away before I misconstrue this as a bribe , okay ? What is this , the silent treatment ? Who sold you the gun , Brian ? What gun ? The one you shot my daughter with this morning . Should n't I have a lawyer around here somewhere ? He 's coming . I do n't have to say anything until he gets here . Let me run this down for you , Brian . In fact , the more she pays him , the more he 's gon na talk . And he 's gon na talk and talk and talk and talk and talk . In fact , he 'll talk all the way through your trial . He 'll talk until he 's blue in the face . But I guarantee you one thing . You 're still gon na go to jail . DOMINGUEZ : Look , Brian , um , we just want to give you a chance to do the right thing , you know ? Tell us what happened . Uh , I think I 'll wait . I think our friend here could , uh , do with a little bit of diesel treatment . That 's an excellent idea . That 's a good grip . I 'm not going anywhere . Hi . Hey , Nick . Son . Hi , sweetheart . Hi , Daddy . How you feeling ? My butt hurts . NICK : Hey . So does mine . He lets me win . I 'll bet . I brought these for you . Thought they might cheer you up .  Mmm , thank you . Pretty , are n't they ? Mm-hmm . Nick , would you take those ? Sure . Thanks . So , uh , I found out who shot you . You did ? Mm-hmm . Do you know a guy by the name of Brian Van Pelt ? Brian Van Pelt ? ! Mm-hmm . Whoa . MAN : Knock , knock . BRIDGES : Oh . Hi . Yeah , listen , uh , just , uh , give ' em to him . Nick , would you take those and , uh , put ' em in some water ? No problem . Thank you . Uh , there you go . Hey , Cass . Hi . What 's going on ? How you doing , Princess ? Better . Yeah ? Now that you 're here . Good ... MAN : Good . Hello , sir . Hi , Freddie . How are you ? Uh , Freddie , did n't you use to be the , uh , car detailing guy ? I was , I was , yeah . Now he manages the Dragonfly . You know , that hot new club in town . Uh-huh . How 'd that happen ? I 've learned not to question why some things happen in life ; they just do . NICK : That 's true . FREDDIE : Wow . You look great . Thanks . Feeling good ? Yeah ? Mm-hmm . Uh , well , I guess we better put these in some water , huh ? Yeah , I guess so .  Check this out , my man . Russian ? KGB . 800 rounds per minute , unbelievable muzzle velocity . Great for shooting through steel doors or hard heads . How much ? Two grand a pop . You 're living dangerously , you know that ? The West Street Gang 's at war with these guys . He 'll come to me and want the same thing . Only I 'll sell him something bigger , badder , more expensive .  Sides mean nothing . Product is the basis for all alliances . Remember that . Guns are due tomorrow afternoon , 5:00 . Pier 17 . Same deal . Pay the man in the green shirt , take the guns to the warehouse .  Oh , bubba ... you 're not looking so good . What happened ? You have trouble sleeping last night ?  Where 's my lawyer ? BRIDGES : Oh , uh ... there 's a problem with that . Uh , we lost your paperwork , and , uh , well , he thinks you were transferred to city jail . But , do n't worry , he 'll catch up with you . In about a day or two , you know . I could call him .  Get you out today . Oh , yeah ? Well , where can we find , uh , Mr . Quick ? Potrero Projects . There 's a ball diamond there . Deals out of the trunk of his car . Well , what kind of car would that be ? I do n't know . It 's red . Red . It 's a red car . BRIDGES : Red car . Let 's go look for a red car . BRIAN : It 's a Z28 Camaro . I 'll call Mommy . Hey , Nashman , next Christmas , I 'm getting you some of those heated sheepskins . My butt 's getting cold . Wow . Red car ? No , red dress . LEEK  : Yeah , right color , wrong model . MAN : Lookin ' good , baby ! Ow !   Harve , what do you got ? Nada . The next Mrs . Cortez just walked by , but that 's about it . Keep ' em peeled . Always ... ? Did you see that bouquet ? It was huge . Mm-hmm . He gives it to Cassidy , and suddenly , she 's feeling better now that he 's here . Yeah , yeah . And that 's the problem , huh ? Oh . It used to be your job . Mm . Look , Cassidy 's getting ready to leave the nest , okay ? She 's transferring her affections to somebody her own age . It 's ... It 's natural .  All right , look at it this way - - in a couple years , she 'll come around , man . She 'll be taking care of you just like you 're taking care of Nick . It 's beautiful . Oh , now that 's comforting . Well , I 'm here to help . And that is a beautiful car . Hey , hey , what up , Quickster ? Got action , Harve . Nash . Yeah , I got him . Harve , you 're hooked up with the black-and-whites . WOMAN : Luisa , good eye . Good eye , Luisa . Let 's see what you got . QUICK : A whole mess of firepower , man . MAN : Hey , how much for that one , esse ? Buck and a quarter . Yeah , okay . Cops , man . Chill . Man , they jumped the gun . Five-O . Five-O . Outta here . Let 's go !        Do n't move ! Stay in the car ! Stay in the car !  Who do we call , 911 or the coroner ? Call PG E . What you got there , Nash ? This guy Quick , his real name was Howard Temple . Did a stretch in Soledad , and he knew his way around the Q . I do n't understand . If the guy is dead , that 's end of story , right ? Nope . Call Judge Pinter and get a search warrant , will you ? I want to see what this guy Gage is all about . You got it . Some goof freshman was showing off a piece I sold him . Piece goes off , shoots some chick in the ass . Chick 's father happens to be this cop . Cop pulls my prints off the piece . Had to do something . What 'd you have to do ? Give ' em Quick . I had to . Cop was out for my blood . I mean , come on . Guy 's careless , dealing out of the trunk of his car , a bunch of lowlifes - - please . Just a matter of time before he got busted anyways . " Why ? " you ask . Because ... I can do twice what he was doing . I can get more per piece , and , baby , I definitely got a better clientele . So the cops grab you , you give up Quick . They grab Quick . What if he decides to talk , huh ? What then ? Guess I 'll just run the business for you while you 're gone . Just kidding . I 've got half a mind to let you run with it , half a mind to knock you down .  Hello . Be right there . Cops are at the store . We 'll talk some more . In the meantime , you might want to polish the naive kid act . It 's beginning to tarnish .  Who 's in charge here ? That would be me . Inspector Bridges , SIU . And you are ? Timothy Gage . This is my shop . Uh , Mr . Gage , we have reason to believe one of your employees has been running stolen weapons out of here . Who ? The name 's Quick . Murdered ? Now why would you think that ? Was he ? DOMINGUEZ : As a matter of fact , he died in a car crash running away from us . Now , why do you suppose he was running away from us ? Beats me . You 're wasting your time here . Eh , what can I tell you . It comes with the job . Yeah , well ... just put the place back together when you 're done . You can do that , ca n't you ? You know , I do n't really like that guy . I do n't know him , but I do n't like him . Dot your " I " s and cross your " T " s , gentleman . We lock this guy up ... I do n't want any hiccups . Just like old times , huh , Nash ? What is ? Oh , you , me , Lisa , Cassidy , back under one roof . What are you talking about ? We never lived under one roof . Mmm-hmm . Well , do n't get too used to it . ' Cause , after tomorrow , it 's back to being the odd couple for you and me . Oh , excuse me , Cassidy wants some aspirins . I 'll take ' em to her . You probably have to go to work . Do n't you ? Nah , not really .  Hi , sweetheart . Where 's Freddie ? He 's on his break . Union rules , you know . You 're very funny , Daddy . We do n't get many moments like this anymore , do we ? No .   Yesterday ... when I heard you 'd been shot , when I saw you at the hospital ... you looked so ... small . So ... It scared me so much . Your mom , too . Is that why you 've been so overprotective about Freddie ? Do n't worry , Dad ... that 's ... comforting . You know , Dad , I 've been thinking . What ? I do n't want to go to college next year . What ? I think I want to wait . And do what ? Well , there 's some significant environmental work going on around here - - you know , the old-growth forests - - and I thought it might be interesting to do that for a while , before I go to college .  Honey , I-I , think that 's , uh , great that you 're ... Daddy , you 're not gon na talk me out of it . I 'm not trying to talk you out of anything . I just do n't think that you should be making those kind of life-altering decisions while you 're in this condition . Daddy , I made up my mind already .  I 'm thinking we talk about this tomorrow . Good night , sweetheart . Good night , Dad . Good morning . Good morning . Yeah , well , with any luck , Freddie will make your daughter an honest woman and you can wake up every morning to huevos rancheros , gourmet style .  At least you have n't lost your sense of humor . I just did . FREDDIE : Morning . Good morning . I just got here , sir . Mmm-hmm , is that right ? Well , I get done with work around 5:00 , then normally , I work on my novel for a couple of hours . Cassidy did n't tell me you were writing a book . Novel-- I still got a long way to go . Listen , I got to run . Ciao . Ciao . Ciao . So , uh , Lisa ... Yes . What would be the house rules around here for male visitors ? Come on , Nash , you think I 'd let somebody sleep here with Cassidy ? One would hope not , not under my roof . We 're not under your roof , son . I know . We 've been discussing it . Oh , we have ? Well , when were we going to tell me ? I did n't want to worry you . Me , worried ? Do I look worried ? You are a little red in the face . Well , you would be , too , if your daughter was going to give up college and go and live among the damn trees .  Nash . Give me 15 minutes . Bon appetit . Ciao . Ciao .  Hello , Nashman , we got a carjacker here . Pulls a gun on the driver . The driver pulls his gun , ends up dead , 16 years old . BRIDGES : Guns are us , huh ? Mm-hmm . DOMINGUEZ : Inspector on the scene ran the serial number of the driver 's gun . Turns up , it 's from the same lot that we 're hunting , so he gave us a call . Okay , now you 've piqued my interest . So I show him a six-pack . Guess who he fingers ? Brian Van Pelt . Mm-hmm . Looks like our shooter 's also a seller . What do you want to bet Gage sold him the guns ? I 'd bet the bank . How 's that get us closer to getting Gage ? The kid 'll give him to us , if I do n't kill him first . Come on , let 's go .      BRIDGES : Police ! Freeze ! Got it . Drop the gun , Brian . Drop it right now . What happened ? You heard what I said , drop it !  You lived . You played me for a fool . Almost got you killed . DOMINGUEZ : You know a Nathaniel Allen , aka Striker ? No , huh . I never saw those guys before in my life . Did you sell guns to them ? No way , man . Do you know Timothy Gage ? Have you seen him since you told us about Quick ? I 'm trying to help you , Brian , but ... What ? I say we cut this guy loose . As much as I 'd like to kill him myself , I think we got somebody out there that 'll do it for us . No-no-no-no-no-no-no - - you ca n't let me go . The hell I ca n't . Unless you start talking .  If I were you , I 'd keep my hands right there on top of the counter where we can see them , okay ? Put that gun down . You know , Joe , when I was a kid , I used to be fascinated with guns . BB guns , cap guns ... You have a gun when you were a kid ? Yeah , yeah ... had a pellet gun once . On a real gun . Not like it is today .  Russian . You know , after car wrecks , you know what the leading cause of death is for young people between the ages of ten and 20 ? Let me guess : MTV ?  Close . Gunshot wounds . My daughter ... was shot with a gun that came from you , Gage . You know it , and I know it . Do you know what that makes me feel like doing right now ?  The same thing that you sent Striker to do to Brian Van Pelt . Hey . Cuff him , Joe . Gladly . Put your hands on your head . GAGE : What 's the charge ? Too numerous to mention .  However ... a little birdie told me that , uh , you have a couple big shipments coming in . Well , we need to know where , and when . Let 's " know so " out here .  We 'll see .  Picturesque , is n't it ? I prefer Pacific Heights . You never been down here before ? They got some great restaurants down here . Hey , homes . Hi there . See that bar right up the street there ? Why do n't you have Little Man meet us there in about 15 minutes . You know Little Man , do n't you ? Striker 's second . You must have me confused with someone else .  We 'll see .  What 's your juice ? I could n't get a latte , could I ? A non-fat , half-caf , no foam ? No . Water will be just fine . Now , Timothy , you look like a scotch man . Bring a bottle of your best scotch for our friend here . Tim . So , uh , Little Man was n't too happy when he heard about what happened to Striker . Especially when we told him about that part about you setting him up . Hmm , yeah . DOMINGUEZ : Gee , that 's a nice watch . Hey ! You must be doing pretty good . It 's for you . Oh , for me ? Yello ? Well , hey , there , Little Man , how you doing ? Long time no see . Well , uh , I 'm just sitting down here at the bar with my partner , Joe Dominquez . Hey , how you doing ? And , uh , your old buddy , Timothy Gage . DOMINGUEZ : Say hi ... Eh , I guess he 's got something on his mind right now . Uh , listen , um , well , the thing is , we 're sitting down here , we 're having a little celebration drink , and , uh - - but the problem is , Joe and I are real busy , we got all this paperwork to do . So we 're going to have to take off . Sure . Come on down , toss a couple back . Bye-bye . Huh . You know what they 'll do to me ? I think I have a good idea . Why do n't you drink up ; it 'll hurt a lot less . Joe ... Hmm ? we got to go . You 're right , we got to go . See you . Okay ! GAGE : Okay ! Okay , okay . Wait a minute . That 's four " okay 's . " Was that four ? Yeah . Huh . Must be official . He 's ready to deal . BRIDGES : Where and when , bubba ? 5:00 , Pier 17 . The man in the green shirt is Kaminsky . Who 's the buyer ? Asian gang out of Chinatown . Excellent . I hope your daughter realizes what she started . What was that ? I said I hope your daughter real ... NICK : In here , son . Hey , Nick . She 's asleep , huh ? Yeah . Here , help me count this here . What the hell 'd you do , Nick ? Go out and rob a bank while I was gone ? Went to the track , and I had five winners out of seven picks .  Damn , that 's awesome . Freddie gave me a few tips , you know . Used to work in Las Vegas , you know . He was a hell of a handicapper .  Hi . Thought I heard you . Oh , hey . Whoa ! Look at you . You look great . Thank you . I have a date . Oh , yeah ? Mm-hmm . Anybody I know ? Oop , sorry . None of my business . LISA : It 's nobody I know . Blind date . She has had her dinner . Her medication 's by the bed . She has my beeper number , and I wo n't be late . Damn , if I was half that organized ... You two would 've combusted a long time ago . Whoa ! You got into Berkeley ? Mm-hmm . That 's great , sweetheart .  That 's terrific . And I 'm going . A year from this fall . I already called to ask if I could defer , and they said yes . Are you mad ? Disappointed . But I 'm , I 'm , still - - you ... you got accepted to Berkeley . That 's , that 's great . Thanks . Cassidy ... Listen , I , I ... I know we do n't always see eye to eye on things , but ... what I 've wanted , what your ... your mother and I have always wanted for you is for you to be happy . That 's all . 
@@5235341   We 're gon na have to ride this out . Harrison .   Usually when I go fishing , the big ones get away . Stay where you are , everyone , and batten down the hatches . Gotcha .  Huh ? What ?  Problem , Harrison ? I thought you liked the sun and sand . Yeah , I prefer more sun and less sand . - Not alone . - Huh ? Everybody , stay alert . Ah . Thanks . I am N'Shuma , leader of the Motai . We come from the Jaguut valley . My son , Kyr , and daughter , Drea . Gus Bonner . Our team came through the stargate . - Truly ? We have heard only legends . - Oh . DREA : You are real , so the legends must be real . N'SHUMA : Come . Visit our village . It will fill the hearts of my people to meet you . Sure , just give us a minute to get the sand out of our britches . You mean , some years it never rains ? Many years .  Huh ? Have you tried ditches , to carry the water from the well to the fields ? We tried , but if we take too much , the well goes dry . Then we have nothing to drink . SEATTLE : Maybe if you dug the well deeper . There might be more water further underground . How can we know if the water is there ? We can not see under the ground . Actually , we can . EC'CO : This echo pattern will tell us what kind of rock lies below us and if there are any deposits of petroleum , natural gas or in our case , water . Well , Einstein , what 's the verdict ? Ca n't you hurry things up ? EC'CO : What 's the big rush ?  Relax . Ah . There 's your water . - Last one in the pool is a rotten egg . - Yes ! I 'm picking up some weird signal interference . Sounds like static from a nearby power source . But I thought we had the only power source around here . EC'CO : Me too . Let 's see what kind of readings we get with the energy sensor .  EC'CO : It 's coming from in there . But how can we get the water from the ground when it is down so deep ? Maybe a windmill . It could power a pump . Right , until one of those sandstorms hits . I doubt any windmill could stand up to one of those . - Harrison 's right . - I am ? I mean , yeah . My father used to say : " There 's always a way to do what needs to be done . " Ec'co ? The MORV computer picked up an odd energy reading . I traced it here to that rock . But it 's just luminescent . No , it 's more than that . - Are there any more rocks like this ? - I can not say . My ancestors found this rock in the place called Chikor . I know that canyon . I can show you . I got nothing , guys . You sure these rocks glow all the time ?  Ec'co ? Stacey ? Hello ? EC'CO : It 's here , right underneath us . It 's off the scale . X marks the spot . We can use the MORV 's cannon to drill into the ground . Let me . This was my idea . Easy . There might be some unstable rock formations below . Relax . I know what I 'm doing . I found it !    Nasty fall . Ah ! Wow .  MAN : I 've done the best I can . Things will be better soon . Just wait . You keep saying that , but things never improve . It 's time to go back , back to our real home . On the reservation , we had friends , family . I wo n't let them think I 'm a failure . We ca n't give up . I ca n't . We made a mistake . There 's no shame in that . Something is only a mistake if you start thinking it is and give up . MOTHER : It 's a mistake when you refuse to admit an error and learn from it . HARRISON : Seattle ? You all right ?  HARRISON : Seattle ? Are you hurt ? Just a little dizzy . I had this sort of dream or memory . Something weird happened . Yeah , you fell in a hole . But at least you found what you were looking for . Right , that 's all that matters . Okay , let her rip .   Okay . Okay , we 're clear .  Strange . Sounds like the battery 's drained . - Unbelievable . - How bad is it , Ec'co ? Well , the connections are okay . It 's got ta be the battery . Is that all ? Could have been worse . I 'll check it out and have it running by morning . - The rest of you better get some sleep . - You heard the man . - We have a lot of work in the morning . - Work ? I thought the big rock was gon na do all the work .  SEATTLE : Radio 's out . Too much interference . Go signal the others that I 'm starting the energy siphon . This had better work . It just has to . I did it .   There 's always a way to do what needs to be done .   Oh , no .    Huh ? Where water go ? It looks like we 've lost power .  Ow . Help . BONNER : What happened ? Maybe I did n't have the siphon grounded well enough . That 's okay . I can handle it . I had the same training course you did . Having someone else check out your work is a good way to catch mistakes . I did n't make a mistake . It 's a new type of energy , the siphon just needs to be adjusted . I told the Motai I was going to help them get water and I intend to keep my promise . Never seen her this determined before . Yeah , it 's like she 's on a mission . - Hmm . - Oh , right . We are . Okay . I 'm ready to try again . I thought you were gon na run the siphon . I decided to start it by remote control , in case there 's any more of that feedback . Good thinking . Did you increase the siphon rate ? I had to , to counteract the tendency for feedback . I thought you said it was a grounding problem . Look , I know what I 'm doing . Unh ! No power . What is that thing ? Some kind of energy creature . Our weapons do n't work on it . It absorbs power . It must have caused the siphon feedback . Actually , it was the feedback . Why did n't you tell us ? We 'll deal with that later . Right now we need to stop this thing . It 's following the power cable to the pump at the new well in the village . Come on , water . Harrison , Stacey , come in . I 'm picking up a transmission , but it 's too garbled to understand . Maybe the reception 's better upstairs . This is Harrison , I ca n't read you . Repeat .  What in the world ? Huh ? Coming through . Let that be a lesson to you never play with giant balls of energy . And definitely do n't play tag with them . Cover your head , kid . We 're gon na take this thing out . You did it . Thanks . I 'll try to lead this firefly away .  EC'CO : Pull alongside Stacey .  - Use the laser on it . - Already tried , it does n't work . Do it . I 'll explain later , I hope . Drive in a circle . Not ordinary energy . What 's Draga doing ? She 's trying to communicate with it . I can hear what she 's hearing . It 's looking for itself . It 's not eating energy , it 's searching for it for a part of itself . SEATTLE : Let 's go home . It 's here . What you 're looking for .  Blast the ledge . Seal it in . - Think that 'll contain it ? - There 's no reason for it to leave now . I think we 're safe . But I could be mistaken . EC'CO : Remember , the hinged bodies will let you lower the windmills at the first sign of a sandstorm , so the winds ca n't damage them . Congratulations , Ec'co . I just helped solve the sandstorm problem . I hope your people can forgive me for all the damage that energy thing caused to your crops . Forgive yourself . Your motive was pure . Besides , with the water from this well we will soon have more food than ever before . I made a big mistake . I knew there was a problem with using the energy from the stone but I did n't want to admit I was wrong . In science , we often learn more from our mistakes than from our successes . No wonder I never learn anything , I never make mistakes .  Subtitles by SDI Media Group

The people who love him want to know if he 's still alive . Like my parents ? Why are you so interested in Mr . Starr ? It 's a family matter . Could you describe his manner , his mood , you know ?

When you find him , give him his toy . His toy ? Yeah . When he was through shooting , he 'd run that all around the place . That ol ' boy was just a big kid , that 's all .

He just transferred in from Chicago . - I was coming to talk to you ... - Bishop , Meyers , you two were due in my office a half hour ago . Yeah . Well , we 've been kind of busy . - I want you both inside now . - Detective , give us a break . We 've gone over this already . Now . - That woman needs a hobby . - She 's just doing her job , Frank . - We 'll see you later , Chicago . - Look forward to it . Yeah , nice meeting you . - Did I miss something ? - Typical I.A . frost . - She 's Internal Affairs ? - Detective Karen Swindell . Do n't get any ideas , Romeo . She 's the original ice princess . - You were saying something about transfer papers . - Come on , Sarge . You know how it is with red tape . They should be along any day now . Until I get the rest of your documentation ... Me ? Sarge , I 'm clean as a whistle . Get back to work . Can I help you , Officer ? Ma'am , did you , by any chance , happen to notice the color ... Whoa ! Is that a twin cam ? - Excuse me ? - You guys bore out the cylinder heads , do n't you ? Man , I 'd love to soup up my honeypot . - Your honeypot ? - My hog . I was goin ' to blow out the headers and open up the cylinder block ... but my Social Security check was late . - Millie . ! - Hey , Mill ! You 're lookin ' good ! Ride ... you devils ! Rode with those dudes in Jacksonville . - Ma'am . - Mildred Reynolds . - Friends call me Millie . - Millie . Guy has the bladder of a squirrel . Hmm . What now ? - Afternoon , missy . - Sheriff . - Would you mind taking off your jacket ? - Excuse me ? Oh , it 's nothing personal . I 'd just like you to take off your jacket , please . - I will not . - Please . You are fired . ! I want you to know I 've seen Deliverance . You wan na give me one of these ? Oh ! That 's good enough . My , my ! Guess you can put some cuffs on this young lady . Ma'am , you 're under arrest for violation of the criminal code 369.7 . And what the hell is that ? Carrying a concealed weapon . It says so right here in the book . Highlighted in yellow . I guess you 'll be going with me . Jarod . So let me get this straight . This starts out as a part of this ... Doughnut . Doughnut hole . I do n't mean to belabor a point ... but if the hole is here , why do you call this the hole ? The truth is , I 've always wondered that myself . But do n't tell my boss . I would n't want him to think I do n't know the business . I promise . And I 'll have another one , please . On the house . Oh . If you do n't mind , I 'd rather eat it here . Good morning , Mr . Kembrook . ! He seems very sad . Poor man . He has n't been the same since Marvin was killed . - Marvin . - His son . He was a guard at the BoswellJewelers . About a month ago , he was shot trying to rob it . Sounds like you know the family pretty well . Hmm . Since I was born . Mr . Kembrook anyway . I 'm afraid you 've lost me . Kembrook started searching for his son . - Found him six months ago . - He must have been very happy . They both were . Turns out Marvin was looking for his parents the whole time too . Can you imagine meeting your own parents for the first time when you 're a grown adult ? Guess it would be pretty emotional . Oh , yeah . Even after all those years , they still loved each other . What makes you so sure ? Because they were blood , and there 's nothing stronger than that . Mrs . Morgan , we may have a sighting on your daughter . My people are flying to New York as we speak . If all goes well , you should have your arms around Catherine ... by tomorrow night . Thank you . God bless you too . How can I help you ? I do n't know who I am . Now , let me get this straight . You stopped me because of an anonymous phone call ? Uh-huh . It 's official . I 'm in hell ! Oh , now , darlin ' , you did have that concealed weapon on you ... and you 'll be able to post bail as soon as Judge Hargrave get back from that bass tournament ... and we sign ourselves some papers . - When exactly is that ? - Day after tomorrow . Thanks . The entire legal staff at the Centre ... is on their annual retreat in the south of France ... so it will be at least 72 hours before we can even reach a lawyer . He knew that . Damn it , Sydney . He 's up to something . And he needs me out of the way for three days . 10:19 . Could be a time reference . Forget that ! Just get me a lawyer . Any lawyer . Most missing persons cases fall into one of three categories : abductions , runaways or abandonment . I 'm looking for my parents . Friendly warning : They do n't all turn out that way . There 's a risk a person takes when they search for their past . It 's not always what they hope for . I 'd be willing to risk anything for the chance to find out . Are they still alive ? Jarod , is he still alive ? The eyes . What about the eyes ? He wants to cry ... but he ca n't . Why not ? He feels alone , forgotten . He just does n't care anymore . - Care about who ? - Himself . He 's given up . I wo n't give up , Sydney . I 'll never give up . Officer Starr ? - Jarod . - Hmm ? I was wondering if you knew if your parents were still alive . I do n't know . I was never told the truth . Why not use the police database to initiate a search ? I ca n't . This is probably gon na be hard to understand , but I do n't have much time . This is my mother . At least that 's what I was told . And my father might have been an aviator . - In the service ? - I do n't know . - I 'll see what I can do . - Thank you . Officer Starr . There 's a group ... people like yourself . There 's a meeting here tomorrow night if you 're interested . Sometimes it helps just to know you 're not alone . Miss Parker . You wanted a lawyer ? - Henry ? - Oh . Tell me you 're kidding . HenryJ . MonroeJr . , Esquire . Finest attorney in Cedar Point . Truth be known , the only attorney in Cedar Point . He knew this . Ma'am , there 's nothing I can do . You do n't understand . This is a death sentence for me . - Millie ? - What ? Finally ! Someone with half a brain in their head . - You know this woman ? - We 've met ... down on Biscayne Boulevard . Now they want to put me in cement boots and dump me into the causeway . She ran an empty county ambulance off the road ... and we 're suspending her driver 's license . Can you give us a moment , please ? Be my guest . I would n't trust that one as far as I can throw her . Millie , this is very serious . What if that ambulance was carrying somebody to the hospital ? Geez , I do n't want to hurt anybody . Look , my , uh ... my husband 's dead ... and my kids are all gone . They 're on their own . I 'm 73 years old ... and I 'm alone . You take my bike ... you take my independence . You take that , you might as well bury me ... ' cause I 'll ... I 'll be dead . A lovely ruby , emerald and sapphire trio ... bordered by diamonds . - How much is it ? - Only $4,000 . Hmm ... princess-cut diamond with a trillion on either side ... for 5,000 . With tax that would be 5,328 . That 's perfect . I 'll take it . You do realize this purchase is going to max out your credit card . That 's the idea . Indistinct An odyssey of searching for the past ... came to a dramatic and emotional conclusion earlier this morning ... as Harold Kembrook nervously waited for the doors of the taxi to open ... and deliver his son , given up for adoption ... some 25 years earlier . As fate would have it ... his son , Marvin Howard Kembrook ... had spent the last 11 years on the very same hunt ... for his true identity . Also on hand to witness the emotional reunion ... was Susan Granger ... the woman instrumental in bringing the two men together , father and ... Off Just a second . - You Starr ? - That 's me . You ordered the doughnuts . - Raspberry Supremes ? - Whatever . Mmm . ! This should cover it . Hey ... that you 're a big doughnut fan ? - They 're very good . - What are you , like , a cop ? How did you know ? That 's funny . Detective Swindell ? I hope you do n't mind if I skip the birthday song . I never actually learned the words . - You read my file . That 's my job . - It 's a Bavarian cream . I was thinking about getting you a Raspberry Supreme , but somebody ate the last one . But this one 's very good . Most uniforms do n't want to socialize with I.A . The truth is , I 'm thinking about putting in for a transfer to Internal Affairs ... and the examination requires that the applicant break down an actual case file ... - And you want my help . - I heard you were very thorough . Uh , do you have any particular case in mind ? Yes , I do . Are you going to eat that ? So , according to the field report ... When they get there , a security guard , Marvin Kembrook ... is robbing the place ... with an accomplice . So this accomplice shoots Kembrook ... and then he gets away . This sounds more like an unsolved homicide than an I.A . investigation . Forensics went over that store with a fine-tooth comb . They did n't find a print , a fiber , nothing . So this accomplice was efficient . If you 're ever gon na make it in I.A . , you have to realize that part of the job ... is to get inside the heads of the people involved in the case . Marvin Kembrook spent most ofhis life in foster homes . When he was 18 , he joined the marines . I looked up his military file . He tested in the lowest five percent of his unit ... spent 10 years in uniform and never busted corporal . Not exactly a criminal mastermind . We 're talking about a young man whojust found out who he was ... where he came from ... and the accomplice was fictitious ... who did it ? There was one piece of hard evidence left at the scene ... the slug they dug out of Marvin Kembrook 's chest . Find the gun that fired that bullet , and you find the real killer . Oh , man ! What , you 're late again , huh ? The desk sarge is gon na have my butt in a sling if she catches me . - Can you do me a favor ? - What 's up ? My transfer papers got sent to my house by mistake . Would you give them to her , after I 'm gone ? - No problem . - Thanks . Hey , listen . You know , I 'm kind of new around here and do n't know many people . I was thinking maybe I could take you and your partner to lunch one day . - My treat . I look forward to it . - All right , man . - Hey , partner . How 's it going ? - All right , bro . Read this . I think we found the guy we 've been looking for . Yeah ? It 's been almost 11 years ... since my son disappeared ... and there is n't a day that goes by ... that I do n't think I see him ... standing on a street corner ... or passing by on a city bus . My friends , they all say , " You should let it go . " But , I mean , how do you deny yourself ? How do you just ... walk away from your life ? You do n't . We 've been coming here for more years than I want to remember ... more years than any of us want to admit . You people know my story , what happened to my son . I 'm here to tell you that you should never give up . You know , we sit here and we ... talk about how much we miss them and ... how much we loved them . In the end , I think it 's ... I think it 's the little things that we miss the most . The way we see ourselves in our children . The way he sat in a chair . His laugh . The way he stirred his coffee . - Never give up ... - Never give up ... - ever . - ever . - Ah , baby , you are bumming my trip , man . - Pint-sized nerd . ! - Nerd ? I 'm real , man . You were n't looking where you were going . ! - I was n't going anywhere . - You do n't have to yell . I 'm not deaf . No , you 're blind , lady . You got ta take a chill ... Well , I wan na tell you . You just better have a little respect ! - You little punk ! - Okay , okay , okay , okay . That is enough . That is enough . You , stay here . You , come with me . Look at that . - Is that it ? - Yeah . It 's nothing that a little sandpaper and touch-up paint wo n't cure . - You do have insurance ? - Yeah , but I 'm not gon na let that old bag get away . She almost wasted me , man . What have we here ? An expired license plate . That 's gon na cost you about a hundred bucks in fines . And I could , of course , search your van . - Sandpaper and touch-up paint on ... - Mm-hmm . Have a nice day . - And you , young lady , you 're coming with me . - Oh . Where ? There . So what did your wife do next ? So what did your wife do next ? She walks in , she packs her bags , and then she splits . - Why would I make up a story like that ? - They are so unbelievable . It 's incredible . Next time I talked to her , we were in some lawyer 's office , 100 bucks per . - Sounds like my last wife . - Oh , no . - Marriage number three ? - No . Four . Four ? Geez ! What , you got , like , a thousand kids ? - No , six . Six real good kids . - And they do n't look like him . Shut up , Frank . Must be tough making ends meet , with all those obligations . I make sure everybody 's well taken care of . Still , you know , there 's got ta be a better way . - What , like Chicago ? - Chicago ? Yeah , we know about the investigation ... the payoff money you were collecting from the dealers on the South Side . - You read my file . - New guy comes in , we check him out . Besides , they never proved anything . It proves that you can cover your tracks , so take it easy . Frank and I do thejob , but we 're always looking for new opportunities . - Is n't that right , Frank ? - That 's right . Takes a special kind of cop to do what we do . We think you 're that cop . That 's all . I 'm sorry , sir . Your credit card came back invalid . That 's impossible . Try running it through the right way . I know how to do myjob . I tried it three times , okay ? Look , there 's some mistake , obviously . - I always pay off my credit card . - There 's no mistake . Frank , looks like we 're gon na have to bail this deadbeat out before he pulls his gun ... and tries to shoot his way out of here . - Thanks . - Gracias . Look , I got ta take my kid to Little League practice . We 'll talk about it then , okay ? - I 'll think about it . - Yeah , you do that . Got a little something right here . Thanks for lunch . Yeah . We got a red flag on your mother 's photo . - Someplace in Delaware . - Delaware ? - Mean anything to you ? - It used to . Well , someone picked up the global scan on the Net that we sent out . We got an anonymous phone call . Whoever it was , recognized the woman in the picture and has a name ... but they 're adamant about not sending anything over the computer system or phone lines . I mean , it seems strange . You want to go forward with this ? - Yes . - Okay . They 're sending the information by special courier . - I 'll call you the second it gets here . - Thank you . Broots ? we_just got a signal alert on Jarod . - Where ? - A missing persons agency in Miami ... We 're not sure . Has anyone alerted Miss Parker ? We thought you 'd want to . I 'd rather stick my head in a bear trap . Yeah . ! - So how many of thesejobs have you pulled ? - What difference does it make ? We 're throwing you a rope . The question is , are you smart enough to grab it ? - Why do you need a third guy ? - ' Cause we had problems the last time out . We need a third guy to plug up the leaks . - How does it work ? - We use the security codes supplied by the stores . - Low risk , high reward . - Oh , yeah . - What if something goes wrong ? - It wo n't . Humor me . What if somebody walks in ? We 're wearing blue . We 're the good guys . - What if they pull a gun ? - Then we take ' em down . I mean , we just make it look like , uh , we stopped a robbery in progress . - We 're home free . - Is that what happened with Marvin Kembrook ? - What do you know about that ? - Come on . I read your files too . What I do n't understand is , how did you tamper with the ballistic report ? - What ? - They never made a match to the weapon that killed Kembrook . Internal Affairs always checks the weapons of the first officers ... that arrive at the scene of a homicide . Think I was wrong about you , Jarod . Let 's go , Frank . Whoa , wait a minute . You 're asking me to risk everything . All I 'm asking is , if something goes wrong ... do I have a way out ? Throwaway . Ankle holster . Unregistered . Something goes down , we use it . - Good . I 'm glad you 're on the team , Starr . But if you cross me , I 'll put a bullet in your heart . Dad ! Dad ! Let 's go ! All right ! Tommy . Attaboy . Ohh ! - You looked great out there . - Want ice cream ? Yeah . ! I plan on suing this entire dirt-water town for every penny it 's worth . - My card . - Stanton . - Let 's get out of here . - Oh , Miss Parker . - Do you know a man by the name of Broots ? - Take a message . He says he located the target ! - Gracias . - De nada . His laugh . The way he stirred his coffee . Mom ? Starr here . It 's Susan Granger . Your envelope is here . I 'm on my way . - You know , Syd , I ought a hand it to him . - He ca n't , and you know it . Hmm . It 's only because of his heart . - What ? - That we are this close , Miss Parker . Jarod knew that if_he sent that photograph online ... we 'd find him . He 's willing to risk everything for an identity ... for a life . That 's what I 'm counting on . I thought you should be the one to open it . I 'm so nervous . It is n't every day you find out who you are . What is going on out here ? Who are you people ? Where is he ? I wo n't ask again . Sam . Sam , he 's going to the roof ! Stop , or I swear I 'll shoot you in the back ! Jarod . ! Sam , get him . - You sent this , did n't you ? - I was with you , Miss Parker . So close ... and yet so far . Hi . This is Officer Starr . - You got the alarm code , right , Frank ? - Yeah . I 'll shut off the juice , then clip the video lines to the surveillance cameras . Once we 're inside , Frankie 's gon na go to the manager 's office and get the gems . You hit the gold cases . I 'll keep an eye on the front . - What if the security guard is early ? - He wo n't be . - What if you 're wrong ? - If I 'm wrong , they 're dead . The clock is running , gentlemen . Let 's do this thing . All right , guys . Let 's do this . - Frank , you all right ? - I got the manager 's office . Starr . Coins , rings and chains , all right ? Stay away from the stupid costume crap . Let 's do it . What are you doing ? I was just wondering how Marvin Kembrook felt the night he died . His heart is pounding at the potential danger . He feels afraid , with good reason . he_just got his life back . he_just figured out who he was . He just rediscovered his family . Imagine his relief when he gets there and finds two police officers on the scene . The good guys . His relief did n't last very long , did it ? You 're under arrest for the murder of Marvin Kembrook . Maybe I do n't want to be arrested . You 're going to jail . You and Meyers . All right , Starr . I 'm just gon na put the gun down . Hey , what the hell is going on ? Sorry about that , Jarod . I do n't dojail . Too many mouths to feed . Oh , my God . Call it in , Frank . - What am I supposed to tell ' em ? - Tell ' em the truth . Frank and I went inside , identified ourselves as officers ... but the place was empty except for the body . The body ? Officer Starr apparently was the first one on the scene . We came back outside and searched the adjacent area ... but the shooter was long gone . Is that the way it happened ? Meyers ! Is that the way it happened ? Yeah . Yeah , that 's how it happened . Show me . Yes , ma'am . Let 's get the lab boys down here to check out that slug . Right away , Detective . Care to revise your story , Officer Bishop ? The body was lying right here . I swear it . I saw it myself . Keys . - Keys ? - Let 's have a look in the trunk of your car . - Let 's roll ! - Hold on tight ! I 'm legal ! You 're under arrest for the murder of Marvin Kembrook . You have the right to remain silent . You have the right to speak with an attorney ... Jarod was in your sight . You could 've killed him . What made you change your mind ? I just missed , Sydney . No more , no less . Hello . Jarod . I told you when I was 11 years old that I would never give up ... and I never will . I know you wo n't , Jarod . Miss Parker wo n't either . - Good-bye , Sydney . - Hold it . Just tell me one thing , Jarod . - What do the numbers mean ? - What ? 10:19 . It 's who I am , Sydney . It 's what you made me . Where will he go now ? - South . - What makes you so sure ? Instinct . 
@@5236141 Previously on Bunheads ... We have land and we 're not doing anything with it . We got ta make money off this place . Get out the gold stars , we have come up with a plan . Fanny : - A great plan . - We 're going to build an amphitheater . I just do n't understand how they got so popular so fast . Cozette can do anything . Cozette 's a wizard . I was wondering if you were in the market for any new business ventures . An amphitheater ? Really ? To the Millicent Stone Performing Arts Center . Ginny : She 's magic and perfect and worldly . And so so hip . She 's Carnaby Street in pointe shoes . - Are you Dutch ? - I ... Your face reminds me of a Vermeer . It does ? What are you doing here ? Clearly this is n't going to happen . This is n't gon na happen ? Yeah , it does n't really seem like you want this to happen . - Well , I do . Bye ! - Great . Bye ! Releve , nice . Tour jete , hold . Releve . Shoulders , Ginny . I do n't know what you mean . Show me what you mean ? Not falling for that again . - Rats . - Nice try though . Jump , children . Jump ! Just put the stuff over there . - Where ? - There . - Yeah . - Not there . - There . - Where ? - Right there . - Where is there ? Sam : There , next to that . Sal : You 'll make me lose my mind . Oi , Tony , Carmella , I 'm teaching a class over here . Sorry , the man ca n't follow a point . You need like air traffic controller sticks just to help him figure out where to put a dance bag . I 'm sure , but you ca n't just ... Okay , everyone . All right . You can stop that . It 's annoying . Places in the center . Stretch . - What 's the good spot ? - Front left center . Best acoustics and everyone 's behind me so when the sweating starts , I do n't smell a thing . Thanks for all the unnecessary information . - Why is Sal here ? - I do not know . You know . He 's going to take tap . - Really ? - No . He runs a dancewear store . He should know how to dance . I do not need to know how to dance . I need to know about dance . And I do . Those three back there , they 're terrible . All you need to know . - It 'll be good for you . - It will not . - You will enjoy it . - I will not . I needed a ride . Give it up Sal , you 've been sammed . Okay , everybody up . Remember the combination we did yesterday ? Let 's do that again . Let 's start a club . Um , oh , by the way . We finally scheduled your meeting . Oh , great . So relieved . You know which meeting ? The rabbi , the priest , and the duck in the bar ? Your meeting about approving the amphitheater . - Taftpokirip . - That 's the association for the preservation of keeping it real in Paradise . Know the acronym , quashing the chuckle . We were supposed to go over your plans , your permits , make sure everything 's in order , blah blah blah . But we had n't gotten around to it . Someone misplaced the post-it to remind her . Whatever . But we found the post-it and it 's happening next week . Great . What do I need to do ? - Nothing . - A reminder follow-up call or two might be prudent .  Oh , that 's me . Hold on . That 's okay . Just take your time . Very busy here . Batten down the hatches , baby . - Mama 's coming to town . - What did you do ? Nothing you would n't do . You did n't drive through three states in a convertible wearing nothing but the words " free speech " painted on your butt ? - No . - Like the Dixie Chicks ' " Entertainment Weekly " cover ? - I got the reference . - ' Cause I would totally do that . - I have no doubt . - And no one would care . I think a couple of kids at a stoplight might have a bit of interest . And a new screensaver . - Are you coming to visit ? - I am . - When ? - In a couple days . - Can you handle it ? - It 's not me , it 's the liquor stores I 'm worried about . - What 's the occasion ? - I just miss my girl . - I 'll be there soon . - I 've got putin on speed dial . - I ca n't wait to see you . - As soon as I learn to speak Russian , - things are gon na get rough . - Muah . Muah . - Talia 's coming . - Really ? Yeah , I have n't seen her in a while . So great . - It is ? - Oh , I should clean up my place . Set up the couch . Buy some snack-y stuff . Finish teaching class . Finish teaching . Crap . Eventually I 'm going to claim the moral high ground in this relationship . Yeah yeah . All right , fifth position .  Arms one , and two .  Bunheads 1x16 - There 's Nothing Worse Than a Pantsuit Original air date February 11 , 2013 Why ca n't we order fries ? It 's a special menu for the fundraiser . There 's nothing on here . But I want fries . You can have fries . Fish and chips . - Chips are fries . - What happened to the real menu ? - It 's a special menu tonight . - Why ? Because it 's a special event . It 's just a shorter menu . Same crap , but less of it . - Yes . Special . - Your drinks , my ladies . - What are you doing ? - Getting drinks . From the bar . You order drinks from me . - I could n't find you . - How hard did you try ? You mean , did I send out a search party ? No . - You got me . - You buy the sodas from the bartenders , they get the tips . They do n't need the tips . They need baths . And syphilis medication . I need this . I 'm going to Harvard . Not on this lame special menu , you 're not . What special menu ? It 's a stupid special menu . I mean it ! Do n't you do it ! Man . You writing the great American novel there ? " It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . " Sorry , that 's taken . Really ? Oh shoot . I 'll just have to start again .   Rico : All right , all right . Do n't get nuts . We 'd like to welcome you guys - to the first ... - Second . Second annual fundraiser for the Surfers United Retirement Fund .  Enjoy the movie . Whoo ! Do n't say I never did nothing for you . What is this ?  Oh my God . You are my hero . Right here . Where 'd you get those ? I do n't know . They just appeared . We thought they came from you . Hey . You ca n't do that . I 'm your waiter ! - You would n't bring them . - I 'm not supposed to . It 's a theme night , damn it . Why ca n't anyone understand that ? Dude , if I tip you to go away , will you ? A good tip , post tax . You have got to get some sort of life . I know . Again , from the top .   - Surfing 's boring . - I know . Hey , you hear they 're doing " Bells Are Ringing " - for Spring Musical this year ? - No . Well they are . I 'm thinking of trying out . Give me something to do other than watch myself age into my mother . Wow , thanks for completely ignoring me . We 're not ignoring you , Ginny . You said you were gon na try out for " Bells Are Ringing . " And no response ? - Nope . - Thanks a lot . - You chicken out every time . That 's not true . Maria in " West Side Story . " Who 's gon na believe me as Puertorican ? - " Li'l Abner . " - I got the day mixed up . I was gon na do it . I bought the Daisy Dukes . Yeah , and I wore them for Halloween . Whatever .    So this is how it 's gon na be at prom . What ? Boo 's gon na be with Carl . Sasha 's gon na be with that guy . And you and me are gon na be by the punch bowl watching handsies and thumbsies make out all night . - Sounds great . - What ? Prom is awful . We wo n't have to buy a dress , or pay to have our hair done or rent a limo . We can just chill or not even go . That 's even better . - That sounds awful . - Why ? Because I kind of want to consider giving it up for a lobster dinner . Well , at least we have each other . That 's something , right ? Your pics . - What ? - Your skating pic . You need an official photo , so I took some of you at the last practice . Wow , some of these are actually great . We spent a summer on Annie Leibovitz 's yacht . Got some tips and some really expensive parting gifts .  I 'll be right back .  So , if you give me your number , I 'll get you some fries . All right . Oh , geez ! Milly , what the hell ? We have a major problem . How did you get in here ? Taftpokirip is convening a meeting to discuss the amphitheater . It was set . The alarm was set . I should have known something was up . It 's my job to know when something 's up . How did you disable the alarm ? Michelle , please . I own property . That explains nothing . We have to nip this in the bud . These local yahoos are always causing problems . They never want anything to change ever . Electricity freaked people out at one point . And water . Let 's live together in filthy quarters and not bathe . The apes are still shaking their heads over that one . What could their problem be ? We did everything right . We filled out all the paperwork . I did n't even sign in pink ink ' cause Fanny told me not to . If there 's not a real problem , they 'll invent one . That 's what people do instead of reading a newspaper . Well , crap . This is terrible . They made it seem like it was nothing . Just another standard meeting . - When ? - Yesterday . - Yesterday ? Uh , yeah , they came in and they ... And what ? They came in and what ? They told me about the meeting ? You knew about this ? - Sort of . - You knew about this and you did n't call me ? I was with the tutus . Always . Always call me . The minute anything happens that ca n't be answered by reading a Judy Blume novel , call me . This is how they got The Edge , you know . The Edge ? U2 The Edge ? All the man wanted to do was build some eco-friendly houses in Malibu . And the next thing you know , they scheduled a meeting . - Geez . - I told him , " Edge , get back there and stop that meeting . " I do n't care what crazy crap " Julie Taymor 's doing . " Did n't listen . You know The Edge ? Like personally ? We carpooled for a while . Hey , how about we do something to butter them up ? Like stage a ballet for a town festival or something ? The Edge tried that too . Appeasement . He offered to put in a park . A dog run . He even offered to play " The Joshua Tree " in its entirety at one of the kids ' birthday parties . And do you know what that got him ? - Nothing ? - Man 's still sitting there with his thumb up his backside . And I 'm assuming he need that thumb to play , so ... We need to move quick , intervene , throw them off their game . - Great . How ? - We need to schedule a meeting . But we already have a scheduled meeting . No , we need to schedule a meeting before their meeting . So like a pre-meeting meeting . A preemptive meeting . Home turf advantage is not just for football anymore . - What ? - Class is supposed to start at 10:00 . Class actually does start at 10:00 . But 10:30 would work great too .  I 'm sorry . I 'll be nicer to you tonight . I promise . Roman ? Who were you just talking to ? My plant . Martha Stewart says you should talk to your plants . - She 's weird . - She 's Martha . So what are you doing here ? Well , I am here to drive you to school . What ? Drive you to school . - Why ? - Because . I have a car . I know . But I 'm here now and we 're heading to the same place , so why not ? Well , ' cause I have a car . And it works , so ... Sasha , I 've decided it 's time to take this thing public . You , me , us . Like we 're Facebook ? Like what couples do . Normal couples . They hang out together . They drive places together . People know they 're together . First , you 're gon na close your door and walk with me down the hall . Want to say good-bye to your plant ?  See you , Ralph . And we 're gon na go to school and walk up the steps together . - Do you understand ? - Vaguely . Accept it . Accept it . You 're a freak . We 'll work on terms of affection later .   Hey , how was class ? Big fun with calculus . What 's up ? Well , I figured since driving to school and walking up the steps went so well , that we should take it a step further . What 's a step further ? - Lunch . - What ? These really are not super foreign concepts . I eat with my friends . So we 'll eat as a group . I like your friends . I think . If they 're as nice as Ralph . You 're North quad . We 're South quad . Breathe . - Breathe . - So Mel , you 're telling your mom you 're staying the night at Boo 's . Go there early , call her from the landline , - and you 're covered . - Got it . And Boo , you 're telling your parents you 're staying at my place . Come over , call your mom from the landline , and you 're covered . So Melanie and I are n't staying at the same place ? Yes , Boo , you 're both staying at Sasha's . - Where are you staying ? - At Sasha 's . I 'm confused . We 're all staying at Sasha 's , Boo , but these are just the stories we 're telling the parents and we have to get them straight . Go over it again ? Roman 's gon na have lunch with us . Deal . Hi , everyone . - Hey . Hello . - Hey . - Hi . - Awkward . Here okay ? Melanie : I guess . Guess I 'm stepping away . Stay close . - What are you doing ? - This was his idea . It 's some sort of mating ritual . Is he your boyfriend now ? I guess . So it 's " official " official ? There 's been no formal announcement in the press , but yes , it 's official . So we can tell people . Yes , tell people . Geez . You just play everything so mysterious . Especially when it comes to boys . - I do not . - The last time I asked you about a boy it was in the third grade , and it was about Jimmy Kuwolski . The ski man . You punched me . I got a bruise . Did n't like talking about the ski man . You guys knew Roman was around . You 've seen me texting him . Mysteriously . You 've never even said his name . Well , I 'm saying it now . - Roman . - We have rules . - We do n't have rules . We have customs . And customs change . I never let Josh eat with us , and Josh and I were together eight years . He worked in the cafeteria , so he could n't . I miss those free brownies . Climb aboard the train , girls . Come on . It 's leaving the station . Fine . I do n't know what to talk to him about though . We can talk about basketball . - Right ? - Already asleep . Even he does n't talk about basketball . Okay , but we ca n't talk about what we talked about yesterday . Yeah , that would be embarrassing . Okay , so we ca n't talk about what we talked about yesterday or basketball , but we can find other things to talk about . Bring him over . You figured in flower shops , restaurants , - parking lots ? - Souvenir vendors , gas stations , Mini-Marts . - Pot dealers ? - What ? There are people who are going to want to spark up before the ballet . Put it in . I 'm definitely not putting that in . Then close your eyes and I 'll put it in for you . You know pot 's only legal with a doctor 's prescription , right ? So , have a panic attack . Fake a migraine . I wo n't need to fake one in a minute . You wear glasses , use that . Michelle : Leave Eric alone , Milly ! Just focus on your own thing . Jayden . Are you in yet ? I 'm into Sam 's . Dopey chick 's password was her cat 's name . Super easy hack . Michelle : Did he say hack ? Are you guys hacking ? This Sal guy 's desktop has got some sort of advanced firewall . Rebekah Brooks . Rebekah Brooks . It 's just information gathering , Michelle . I have a stack of files on every person in this town . Trust me , it comes in handy . Michelle : Do you have a file on me ? I brought the necklaces you asked for . Bold , beaded , something Hillary Clinton would wear - to Bangladesh . - She makes killer bead choices . - Go with black . - There 's so many buttons . And every time I button a button , there 's another button to button . Michelle , just come out here please .  And I was expecting thunderous applause . - Get that away from me . - Nope , stand still . I could play with the crotch a little . Best offer all day . It 's not the crotch . Guys , I 'm not really a pantsuit kind of gal . How about a dress ? No . It has to be a pantsuit . Unless color blocking is code for destroy , it wo n't help .  That 's Sal . He 's calling from his bathroom . Thanks , Jayden . Hey there , Sal . No , I 'm sorry . I know the change was abrupt , but I 'm out of town next week and this is so important to us , you understand ? I 'll tell you what , I 'll supply some snacks , make it more like a party than a meeting . Yes . And to you and yours , Sal .  Michelle , how long does it take - to put on a jacket ? ! - It 's on . I 'm just sad . We 're gon na need bigger beads . Truly , show me where you keep your jumbo beads . Jumbo beads ? I love jumbo beads . Talia , save me ! What is going on here ?  - What is this ? - It 's a pantsuit . We 're having a preemptive meeting with the town elders about our amphitheater . And apparently , if I wear this , they wo n't get us like they got The Edge . - Because it 's weaponized ? - And there 's beads . - I missed you . - I missed you too . What 's with " The Social Network " over here ? Oh , this is our super team . That 's accounting , that 's our hacker . I do n't know those guys , but they freak me out . And this is our board room . Have a seat . Truly : - Do n't sit . - Sorry , Truly . Truly , hey girl . - Hey , girl . - Love the hair . Oh thanks , it 's just a new thing . - Talk to me . - What ? What do you mean what ? You 're the one who drove all the way down here with this mysterious big news of yours . I need to know . Spill . He did not get down on one knee , but he did spell it out with rose petals . Wow ! What did you say after , you know , you stopped throwing up ? - Nothing yet . - What do you think you 're gon na say ? Well , as I was leaving and I 'm kissing my Ricky good-bye and he was all sweet and adorable , I was like , " definite yes . " - Yay . - Then I stopped at Peggy Sue 's on the I-15 and there was this table of incredibly hot guys right next to me , so it was " no . " Oh . Then I stopped at a really cute store in Cambria . Credit card got declined , so it was " yes " again . Then I got a flat tire , this guy pulls over , changes it for me , very cute . Very Jon Hamm . I like Hamm ... - I 'm hearing a drumroll .  It 's a yes . Big shiny yes . Oh , I 'm so happy for you . Congratulations . Thanks , Trules . So , drinks and then drinks ? You know my rule . One drink per karat . So we 're getting wasted tonight . Not in the pantsuit , you 're not . I swear it does n't have to be like this . - What , your sandwich ? - No , this . Talk . Please talk . About whatever you want . I beg you . But we do n't know basketball . I do n't care about basketball . Ginny : Okay , fine . Let 's talk . You know , I was rewatching " The Notebook " the other day , and I came up with a whole new theory . Anything but " The Notebook . " Well , I watched " The Vow " the other night , and I could n't figure out why ... - Carl . What 's wrong ? I thought your lunches were an all girl thing . They were . - Sasha changed it . - I did n't change it . Roman changed it . Hey , I 'm Roman . Carl . I did n't know you could just change the rules . I did n't know you could just change them either . There were never rules . Well , if there are no rules , I 'm sitting here . Do n't mind me . Just keep doing what you 're doing . Good luck with that . What the hell ? Whatever . Just saw these guys here , so I figured " hey . " Impeccable logic . Great . So this is a couples ' table now . - Is that was this is ? - Dez and I are not a couple . Yeah , it 's not like we 've even kissed or anything . Hello ? You turn into a puddle whenever you 're around him . I do not . No , you get liquid-y pretty quick .   ... Seven , eight .  Okay , okay . A little bit faster , Brad . More Ramones , dude . All right , a little bit faster . Okay . -  -  Okay , everyone . Thank you . Nice work . No no no no ... no need for formalities . Move it . Move it . Clap while you 're walking . Clap while you 're walking . I need my dance bag . There you go . Move it . Mama 's got a pantsuit to get into . Hey stragglers , vamoose .  Hey , do you guys want to come see me at Derby tonight ? I can get comps . - Yeah , I 'll go . - Sasha , you in ? Ca n't take the toilets . Homework . Michelle : All right , 5:00 . The studio 's officially a " no kid " zone . Anything or anyone up there is going out the window if they 're not out in 30 seconds . - Do you want a ride ? - I 'm gon na walk . To each his own .   I feel very uncomfortable . You look terrifying . Oh . Well , thanks . So , what do you think they 're talking about over there ? They 're talking about the fact that I promised snacks and they do n't seem to be here . Really ? How can you tell ? Michelle , please . I own property . Okay , we 've let them stew long enough . Let 's get this show on the road . Hello , everyone . I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice . We are so grateful that you were able to juggle your schedules around like this . Did I ? My goodness , Sal . Apologies . I have no memory of that . Should I send someone to the store to get us some crudites ? - No . - Okay then . Why do n't we just get going then ? I see you brought easels . Easels mean presentations . So since it seems like you have things you want to present , I cede the floor to you . Oh , I can sit now ? Great . Joe : I ca n't find the permits folder . Do you have the permits folder ? Stephanie : I put it over there . I did n't eat because she said snacks . None of us did . Crudites is not snacks . I ca n't eat anything raw ever . - It 's death . - I hate Kale . Sal : Kale . Kale is terrible . I got the folder . Okay , we 're ready .  Michelle : Why is he looking at my beads ? They look like meatballs . Oh , good . That 's good , right ? Maybe this is going to be easier than you thought . So , the only thing left to discuss is the environmental impact that this construction will have on our community . What does that mean ? This is a photograph of your land in 1937 . Notice all the trees . Trees that currently are no longer there . Where did they go ? I do n't really know . You should . You 're wearing the pantsuit . Sal : By our estimation , you 're planning on felling at least eight more trees . No , absolutely not . We have no plans to fell any trees . I think . I actually have no idea what felling a tree would be . Cutting it down . Oh , then yeah . We 're gon na fell a bunch of trees . - Ha ! - We have to make room for the stage . You take out the trees , you are displacing the squirrels . Where are they going to go ? Well , ca n't they just move to another tree ? - Wow . - Heartless . That 's why we have a Taftpokirip . Sam : Just move to another tree . What if you stored your nuts in a tree and then you went out one day , you came back and poof , that tree was gone ? You 're kidding , right ? You 're a squirrel . What are you going to do ? Sue ? Go to squirrel court ? Say " some lady took my nuts " ? Yeah yeah . I really am having this conversation . What if the tree you cut down was the tree that that squirrel raised his kids in ? Or he was raised in ? Yes , what if it was his childhood tree ? What do you say to him ? - Or her . - It absolutely could be a her . Well , I guess I would say " Mrs . squirrel , if your husband is just " " laying around the tree all day " " while you 're out slaving away " " to put nuts on the table , " " then you dodged a bullet , my friend . " You 're not taking this seriously , are you ? No , I 'm not . Sorry . All you pantsuit wearers are the same . Not concerned with anyone but yourself . You know , when I heard about The Edge , I thought " this story ca n't be true . " " There must be more to it than that , " but clearly it 's completely true . No one comes into this community and does whatever the hell they want . Yeah , especially not after " Pop . " I paid full price for that turkey . What a snob . We do n't need you to enlighten us . We have two community theaters and a Color Me Mine . We 're done . - Thank you . - And we 'd like our cheese .  Really ? No no no wait . You have n't ... you only have talked about the squirrels and trees and Color Me Mine .  Okay , everyone . These pants are supposed to cut me like that . Sorry . Okay . Well , I think we 've ... heard all of your concerns . Seen your presentations . Now ... let me tell you all how this is gon na go down . Oh God . Where is it ? Where are you ? Come on . Come on . - Looking for something ? - Ah ! Oh my God . You spooked me . Do n't spook me . I did n't mean it . Sorry , it 's just you spooked me . What are you doing ? Homework . My mom just found out that Faye Mendelson and my dad are trying to conceive . Believe me , it 's much more quiet here . - I 'm sorry . - Par for the course . Well , Ginny , here 's what I 've learned tonight . If you 're gon na have a meeting , have snacks at that meeting . You should be writing this down . Because without snacks , people do n't know what to do with their hands and they get grumpy . Snacks . Ginny , snacks . Snacks . Good . Now , have you seen a jacket that looks like this one but without all the sweat stains ? No . But I 'll help you look . Truly said she 'd leave me a spare somewhere . I 've just been soaking through this all night . I do n't think I 'm cut out for legal issues and pantsuits . I wore my first pantsuit when I was nine . My mom was selling a house using the baby angle . Dress guards . But honestly , they 'd have to be industrial strength . ' Cause I 'll level with you , I do n't perspire . I freaking sweat . Here . Oh , thank you . This is excessive , even for me . I was in a donkey costume for an experimental production of " Don Quixote " and I did n't sweat this much . Hey , you 've auditioned for lots of stuff before , right ? Hit me when I 'm down . That 's not nice . They 're holding auditions for " Bells Are Ringing " at school on Friday . Oh , I know that show . I like that show . I going to audition for the touring company once , but the night before , I threw up on the choreographer . - Oh , you got sick ? - No , I ... Yeah . So I missed the audition . And if you think this is a lot of sweat , you should see me after I throw up on a choreographer . Absolutely . Really ? Tomorrow afternoon ? Sure . Yeah , sure . Sal : Millicent ! Where the hell did you get those pictures ? ! Oh God , I better get back down there . Talia , stop stealing the silver . God , that is the best shower I have ever been in . - Do n't say it . - What , that you 've been in a lot of showers ? - I would n't dream of it . - Thank you . Think Fanny will mind that we 're staying in her house ? - No . - Think she 'll mind I used all her lotion ? - No . - Think she 'll ever know that we stayed in her house and I used all her lotion ? No . Wow . Champagne and pizza . Are we dating bowling champs again ? Nope . We 're celebrating . - Yes . Celebrating what ? - Whoo ! - Well , congratulations . My first pantsuit victory . And I have to say , at first , I was all against the whole concept , but now I get it . It 's binding . So it keeps all your powers in . Plus , there 's no potential " Basic Instinct " moment . So suddenly you 're not thinking about how you 're sitting and you 'd be surprised how much brain space that frees up . Plus , the pockets . Dance clothes never have any pockets , but this suit has pockets everywhere . And ... You can do that . I have always wanted to do that . - To Hillary Clinton . - Hear hear . Drink up . I want to take my new pantsuit out for a spin . See if guys can pick up on my new polyester super powers .   Vegas . Hello ? This is Talia . - Who ? - Is it Rick ? Is he dead ? What ? No . Shh . Yeah , no . Of course I do . How have you been ? Wow . That 's pretty good . Uh-huh . You 're kidding . You 're kidding ! You 're kidding . - I do n't think they 're kidding . - Well , I do n't know . I 'm not really ... um , okay . Sure . I will talk to you later . - Whoa . - What ? Do you remember Andy Donnelly ? - The one who only wears bike shorts ? - No . - The one who punched Don Rickles ? - No . He was at Crazy Horse Paris when I worked there , remember ? - A bunch of years ago ? - The choreographer . - Sort of . - Sort of ? - He parked cars . - How is that sort of a choreographer ? - The parking lot was very tricky . - Right . " - Are you serious ? Yeah , and he has a part to fill ASAP , - and thought of me . - After eight years he thought of you . - Just like that ? - I guess so . You sleep with a guy for two weeks and eight years later , he just thinks of you for a part . - What are you implying ? - That you are really good in bed . - Well , duh . - Wow . A part . " Rock Of Ages . " - New York ? - Touring for now , but they pull a lot of their Broadway replacements from the touring company , so it 's not out of the question . New York ! Geez , that 's great . Yeah , he 's gon na call later with details . - So ? - So ... So why are n't you excited ? I am . I just do n't know if I can do it . Sure you can . " - I just got engaged . - So ? So I 'm just supposed to up and take off ? I could be gone for like a year . He could go with you . Most hotels have wheelchair ramps now . Rick does not want to follow me around on tour , and New York is out . Ricky hates New York . So you 're just gon na turn it down ? I do n't know . It 's just so out of the blue . It 's crazy ! I 've been sitting in Vegas on my ass for five years , and nothing . The minute I get engaged . I guess when it rains , it pours . I guess so . So what are you gon na do ? I do n't know . It 's nice to be thought of though . It is . It definitely is . Well , I guess this is to you then . We both have something to celebrate tonight . Yeah . Pizza , sauce , you know .   Hi . Hi . - Was the door locked ? - No . - Was it stuck ? - No .  Well , it 's a stupid knob anyhow . You been waiting long ? Nope . Hour , hour and a half tops . Sorry about that . Was out late celebrating with a friend . The day kind of got away from me . She had a good night eight years ago , and look at her now , right ? I got a pantsuit rash . - Yikes . - Yeah . Okay , so what are we doing here ? Well , it 's called " A Perfect Relationship " from " Bells Are Ringing . " I have to sing and there 's a little routine . And I set up a switchboard because she works at ... Okay , right . So , should I just jump in ? Both feet . Go ahead . I had to use cassette tapes . - What ? - Babbling . Moving on . Never turn up your nose at a valet parker . - Okay . - It 's a good tip . - I 'm sure . - They have long memories , those guys . Right . So , should I ... What ? Yes , right . Entertain me .  ? It 's crazy . ridiculous . it does n't make sense . that 's true . but what can I do . I 'm in love . with a man . Plaza-oh-double-four- double-three . it 's a perfect relationship . I ca n't see him , he ca n't see me . I 'm in love with a voice .  ? - How do you stop this ? - Oh , push the ... Oh yeah . I got it .  ? It 's a perfect relationship . I talk to him and he just talks to me ? And thanks for the nap .  Sorry . - You done warming up ? - I ... I can come back when you 're ready . - I 'm not very good at this . - Way to sell . - Sorry . - When you show up for an audition , audition , okay ? You ca n't count on some guy you had a brief hot fling with 10 years ago remembering you and calling you out of the blue for a part , right ? - Right . - That 's a freak event . Never happens . Never . To most of us . Okay ?  All right , bring it , meat .  ? I 'm in love . with a man .  ? Look at the audience . It 's creepy . ? I 'm in love with a voice .  ? Think about what you 're singing . ? It 's a perfect relationship . I talk to him , and he just talks to me ? Act it . Do n't sing it . ? And yet I ca n't help wondering . what does he look like . I wish I knew ? No ! ? What . does he look like . is he six foot seven or three foot two ? No ! ? Wow . That was so good . Yeah , really ? I thought I was a little off at the end . No , it was perfect . Okay , good good . It was good . I did good . Thanks . Um , Michelle ? Yeah ? Oh , crap . Right . From the top .   ? I 'm in love with a man .  . ?  Oh . - Hi . - Hey . Hey . You going in ? Yeah . I am going in . That 's where I was headed . In . There are things known , and things unknown . And in between are the doors . What does that mean ? Go in . Right . I ca n't believe you actually did it . You actually auditioned for a school play . Why did n't you tell us ? I did tell you and you mocked me . - We did . - We have been silenced and chastened . We heard you were great . You did ? From who ? And did they say great or really great ? Ally was working on sets and she said everyone was talking about you . Were they ? How dear . - What ? - She 's being obnoxious and pretentious . Well , us in the biz have to have a healthy ego . - That 's how we survive . - How 'd you finally get the nerve ? I asked Michelle to coach me . - You 're kidding . - She was mean and called me names , and then she showed me how good she is and how bad I was , and then she threw her water on me . Though I 'm not sure that was totally on purpose . Merkowski , the half-deaf music teacher was n't going to be a problem . And she was n't , and I rocked . - We bow to you . - As well you should . - So , when do you hear ? - Callbacks are Tuesday . It 's between me , Sari Enfield , and Tyrone Fredricks . Melanie : Oh , Ty 's good . Yeah , but he played the lead in " The Prime Of Miss Jean Brody " last year , so they 've got to go with fresh blood this time . Get it , do n't get it , it does n't matter . All that matters is that I am now officially fabulous .  Okay . Excuse me a sec . Hey there , sailor . Doing a little sketch , are you ? Working on a mural for the studio . A mural . So Diego Rivera . Hey , Frankie , you know what I was thinking today after my audition ? I was thinking , you and me , we should hang . - Huh ? - You know , hang . Do some hanging . Of your pictures . Which I ... I bet need to be hung . Um ... I 'm not warmed up . - What the hell ? - Shut up . Wow . That was awkward . Like white shorts in a rainstorm awkward . But here is the bright spot . Frankie actually loves awkward . He thrives on it . It 's comfortable that he has a problem with . So you 've just made some serious headway . - Why are you talking to me ? - Oh , I was just ... I did n't ask your opinion . I did n't ask you to come over here and I do n't know what gave you the impression that I did . - I was just trying ... - Do n't . Do n't try anything . Hey , Heidi ? It does n't really matter to me whether we 're friends or not , but just to clarify , my family is tight . Zappa tight . So if you want a chance with the brother , you 're gon na have to be cool with me . Sorry . I just think if I go he wo n't wait . Long-distance relationships can be hard . I had a boyfriend who was in the Peace Corps . We were together for two weeks before he left , and then he was gone for a year . You 're kidding . And I was completely faithful . How ? It was very difficult . I watched a lot of " Little House On The Prairie " reruns , if you know what I mean . Oh , sure . And when he came back , he had a beard and dirty fingernails . And he drank this tea that smelled like cigarettes and I just found him completely disgusting . I want one . - Here . - What are you doing ? I do n't know , but it 's not going to include a pantsuit . 
@@5236241 My father was an innocent man , destroyed by powerful people . The Graysons are behind this . They 're gon na pay . I 've dedicated my life to avenging his death . Eventually , someone 's gon na find you out . And I wo n't stop until they 've all paid the price . I pronounce you man and wife . I suspect you 're about as pregnant as I am . This photo proves that you 've been targeting my family and my son for years . Good-bye , Victoria . Two minutes and then fire . I heard everything . You set me up . - Why did you tell me I was gon na be a father ? ! - I 'm sorry . Oh , my God . Where 's Emily ? She should 've beat me to the beach ten minutes ago . Emily Thorne is still missing at sea . Former governor Grayson and his immediate family are being questioned by authorities at the Hamptons Coast Guard facility . And so far , there is no word yet on suspects or a motive . Oh , my God . Nolan , what happened ? I ... I do n't know . I just found out . Oh , God . Nolan , I 'm so sorry . What can I do to help ? I do n't know . Uh , I 'm gon na go find Victoria . I 'll call if I get any ... any information . Uh , keep in touch ? - Yeah , I will . - Okay . All right . Here 's to you , Ems , and well-laid plans . No ! Ugh ! I had Emily 's signal for a moment . Now it 's gone . I thought you said you could track her anywhere on the planet ? The transmitter may have been broken in the fall . I have to go find her . Hold on . The currents could have taken her anywhere . I do n't understand how this could 've happened . Emily plans for every last detail . I thought we 'd prepared for all the variables , but it turns out we were lying to ourselves in order to meet that damn deadline of hers . It 's all my fault . No . It 's mine . What are you talking about ? I gave her that deadline . I told her that if she did n't finish this , I would expose who she really was . What ? I just wanted her to stop . It 's her . She 's got it working again . Go to Ross , tell him what happened . You wait for me there . I may need both of you . Go ! I was governor of this state , so do n't tell me what ca n't be done . I want more choppers in the air , and I want them now . Okay . You know , I do n't get it . Someone close to us shot Emily . I know exactly where you were , and Daniel . But Mom ? Just let the police do their jobs . All right , sweetheart ? I hate to ask , Mr . Grayson , but I need to establish your whereabouts at the time of the shooting . He was with his family . We were watching a wedding video in the main cabin . I ... I 'd be much obliged if you could offer this young man a moment alone . We 're gon na find her , son . My photographer and I were covering the honeymoon for Voulez . We were in the main room with the family when the captain sounded the alarm . And who was with you at that time ? I do n't know . There was so much confusion . Uh , but perhaps these might help . They 're photos of the event . Hundreds of them . No , no . Of course . And why were n't you listed on the official manifest , Ms . Davis ? I was a late addition . Conrad . Can you tell this overblown hall monitor that I was sitting with you when Emily was shot ? I can confirm her statement . But thanks for your diligence , Officer . I had hoped that lying to the authorities was not gon na be a component of this relationship . Do you mind sharing where you actually were ? I did n't do this , Conrad . Honestly . I was waiting for you in our cabin . But since no one can confirm that , I did n't want to risk telling that to the police . We finally have a second chance at a life together . I do n't want anything getting in the way of that . Neither do I . We found shell casings on the deck , Mrs . Grayson . That means somebody onboard shot your daughter-in-law . I do n't appreciate your tone , Detective . Well , I 'm sorry , Mrs . Grayson . But when a witness refuses to cooperate , my antenna goes up . I am not the shooter . - Let 's leave it at that and move on . - All right . Let 's discuss the public feuds you 've had with the victim . Not without my lawyer . We need to get you to a hospital . Do n't take me back . Let 's just go . Like we wanted to . If I do n't get you help , you 're going to die . Do you understand ? I just want ... I wan na be with you . Okay . Okay . Emily . Em . Emily , you stay with me . Emily ? Hmm ? Oh , God . Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Everything fell apart . Aiden said that Victoria even knew about the fake pregnancy . So Victoria shot her ? She could n't have . Emily 's alive . She 's at Suffolk Memorial . I found her on a boat . She was in shock . So I did n't have much time , but I made sure that the captain discovered her . You did n't bring her in ? I could n't take the risk . Our connection would 've been revealed , and Emily would 've been exposed . You ca n't toy with her life like that . Your plan is over . Let it go ! Who the hell are you to lecture me ? ! You were the one who drove her to this . So why do n't we focus on how we can help her ? Because if she survives , she is still in danger , maybe now so more than ever . He 's right . Once the Graysons find out she 's alive , they 'll ... They 'll panic . They 'll spin some cover story to protect themselves . Or they 'll finish the job . Not on my watch . Then it 's a good thing that I paid for half of it . You wan na help Emily ? Go talk to that girlfriend of yours . She was there . Find out what happened . Mom ? I 've been trying to get to you for over an hour . - What the hell is going on here ? - Oh , my God . I 've become an official person of interest . And judging by the look on my attorney 's face , I have every reason to be concerned . Is there ... something you wan na tell me ? If there is , you know , I can handle it . No , I did n't do it , Patrick . But after learning the truth about Emily , oh , I wanted to . What truth ? She has been targeting my family for years . She even faked her pregnancy to trap Daniel into marriage . I confronted her . She admitted it . Why would she come after you like that ? I have no idea . It 's like an obsession . I should n't have left you last night . Do not punish yourself . You 're the only person I can truly trust . And I need you now more than ever . Well , then come here . Sit down , please . We 're gon na prove that you 're innocent . I do n't know how . I 'm in terrible trouble . I was with Emily just before she was shot . And then what happened ? I do n't know . I , uh ... I ... blacked out . And then I woke up in the stateroom . I have no idea how I got there . You got ta tell the police that . A story that sounds like delusional ravings of a woman who 's trying to prove she 's innocent ? No , Patrick . My only hope is that this never surfaces . Daniel , I need you to focus . Sorry ... get along . My mother did n't shoot her . Lydia Davis claims Victoria was upset with Emily right before the attack . Something about a photograph ? Lydia Davis is one step above a call girl . Her word means nothing . Well , if I only took the word of respectable people , I 'd never solve a case . Detective , you have a second ? Thanks . They found your wife . - Is she , uh ... - Yes . She 's alive . Emily 's a very lucky woman . She suffered massive blood loss from the gunshots to the abdomen , and she sustained a cranial injury from the impact of the water . There 's been some bleeding on the parietal lobe , which we 'll monitor , but she 'll pull through . What about the baby ? I think it would be best if I talk with Mr . Grayson alone . Daniel , we 'll be at the house if you need us . Daniel , I 'm afraid I have troubling news . Blood tests show your wife was ... never pregnant . Um ... I 'd like to keep this private . Okay ? Mr . Ross , you may as well turn around right now . This is a family matter . Emily is my family , and I 'm gon na make damn sure that yours does n't harm her . How dare you speak to me that way , after what you 've been up to . What has Daniel ever done to you ? Do you get off causing innocent people pain ? I will let you know if I meet anyone innocent . So in the meantime , I 'm gon na go see Emily . You have no legal right . Without a family representative , you may not go beyond those doors , no matter how many wings you 've named after yourself . Look , Nolan , it 's best if you just go . I thought that we said that we were n't gon na let the women in our lives get in the way of what we have ? So just help me . Please . You did n't go to the city last night . You were with him . I told you these people could n't be trusted . How could you ? ! Oh , how could you ? Mom . Get out of here . Go . Where ... Where am I ? You 're in the hospital . Why ? What happened ? You do n't know ? What do you remember ? Nothing . I do n't remember ... anything . Mm . Please , tell me ... Who am I ? - I should 've come with you . - Yeah , believe me , there was no getting past either of them . I had no choice but to pull the ejector seat . Now we have no way in . Now I have access to the patient files . Well done . Where 's Emily 's ? She 's stabilized , but those bullets really did some internal damage . Oh , no . " Transient global amnesia " ? Aiden , that 's major cerebral trauma . She 's surrounded by the enemy . She 's faking her condition to buy herself time . Yeah , it does sound like my Ems . She just gave us the opportunity to move her out of there . To where ? I know a safe house where she can get medical attention away from the Graysons . Now can you access the other hospital computer systems ? You give me enough time , and I will make the toilets flush in morse code . - Margaux . - Hey . Oh , am I glad to see you . I got your messages . You okay ? Uh , yeah . I 'm fine . I am so sorry about Emily . And all the Graysons claim to have been there , too . Someone 's lying . Are these ... Are these copies of the pictures you gave to the police ? No , I hid these from them . They 're the ones taken at the time Emily was shot . After what you told me about Conrad , I could n't risk it . It 's a good move . Well , if Conrad is guilty , he 's done an excellent job of hiding it . Look . He 's in photo after photo at the time of the shooting . This means he had someone else pull the trigger . Or maybe he did n't do it . The press think it 's Victoria . She truly hates Emily . And she 's not in any of those photographs . She 's not the only one missing from these pictures . You 've spent more time out in this hall than in there with her . Well , she needs her rest . None of this is your fault . I checked on Sara . - Wh -- - She 's okay . And do n't worry . Emily will get better . She will pull through . I know the police talked to you about Mom . They asked me , too . Well , she ... She 's innocent , Charlotte . I do n't think she is . No one does . I never knew how uncomfortable this chair was . When I showed you that picture , Victoria , I simply wanted you to know the truth about Emily . I never expected for you to shoot her . You 're out of your depth , Lydia . You always have been . Cross me again , and watch what happens to you . Ooh . Your confidence is woefully misplaced , Victoria . You lack an alibi to substantiate your claims . And hiding from your lawyer instead of offering anything plausible reeks of guilt . Hmm . I 'm really enjoy remodeling Grayson Manor . Well ... You 're certainly behaving like someone incapable of murder . But I do look forward to your performance on the stand , my dear . I 've always enjoyed a good farce . Ross , I 'm here . I 'm going in . I just finished looping the security cameras . You can now move through the hospital undetected . There 's one more thing I need you to bring with you to the safe house . Engagement ring , perhaps ? Yeah , few steps ahead of you , Mathis . Figured you wan na put that little trinket back on her finger . I 'll stand by until you are in position on Emily 's floor . We need to talk . Actually , I do n't think we do . See , I needed your help today . But instead , you decided to check back into the Bates Motel . And you know what , Patrick ? Frankly , I 'm not into mama 's boys . You 're no different than Emily . So now you 're going to attack a woman that is fighting for her life in a hospital bed ? - That 's classy . - Oh , please ! Let 's stop , all right ? She 's not as innocent as you make her out to be , Nolan ! And quite frankly , neither are you . You know what , man ? I should 've bailed the minute I found out you bribed my ex-wife to get dirt on me . Well , do n't let me stop you now . All right , Mathis . Let 's do this . I 'm in . Shh . Shh . There 's an ambulance waiting for us downstairs . I 've arranged for medical attention to meet us at the safe house . Please do n't hurt me . Who are you ? Emily ? Emily ? Em , what are you doing ? Help me ! Somebody ! There was a man . It was just a nightmare . - No . - You 're all right . You 're okay . What 's ... What 's wrong ? We tried to get Emily out . It , uh ... It did n't go well . She did n't recognize me . All I saw in her eyes was fear . It 's bad . There 's ... brain swelling . It 's neurological damage , but ... I did some research , and her diagnosis is as psychological as it is physiological . So what are you saying ? That it 's not just from her injuries ? Her mind shut down . It 's a defense to deal with the trauma . Emily needs someone to just make an emotional connection with her , so she feels safe to be , well , Ems again . Ross , I was ... I was with her . That does n't work . Yeah , well , you went in guns hot . Emily was n't exactly primed to find her happy place . No . I did this to her . I pushed Emily , and now she 's ... She 's like this . Seeing me may only make things worse . This is evidence that Margaux found . I thought you should have a copy . Take care of her . Just let him go . What is the matter with you two ? ! Emily needs us ! Look , for all we know , someone is biding their time , waiting to finish the job ! - You 're right . - What is our next move ? There 's some things I need to do alone . Mom . Daniel . Oh , I 'm so grateful you 're here . You understand that these accusations against me are untrue ? They say you 're gon na be arrested . Well , I 'll endure . But I promise you , nothing is as it seems . I know . I know everything . You 've been right about Emily from the start . I did it . I shot her . She tried to kill herself . I could n't breathe . I went outside . That 's when I heard you both . I did n't go up there to hurt her . I was just so angry . Daniel , where did the gun come from ? I do n't remember . I was drunk . The gun was there . I picked it up , and ... And it ... Now they 're blaming you . And I know we 've had our problems , but I am not gon na let you go down for my crime . Daniel , you have to understand that Emily set you up . For all we know , she put the gun there . She is a monster . I will not allow you to sacrifice yourself - for her cruelty . - No , Mom . - Daniel , please . - No . No . My life is n't your problem to fix . Now I 'm getting a lawyer . Coming here in the middle of this media firestorm may not be the smartest thing to do , but ... I need an ally . And I could n't help but notice that you 've yet to take a public stance on my guilt . I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it . Jack told you what Conrad did to his family ? Yes . - How did you know ? - I did n't . But Jack is a man of principle , and I would think that he would want you to know the truth , given your long-standing history with my family . I was shocked to hear what Conrad is capable of . I think he 's trying to frame me . You want more than an ally , Victoria . You want an objective party to help prove your innocence . And expose Conrad 's guilt . You were there , Margaux , and yet , you do n't seem to buy the police 's theory . Each guest claims to have been in the main room . Lydia . She 's not here . Which means she lied to the police . You look so beautiful . It was a like a real-live fairy tale . You 've got ta remember something . I do n't . I know you will . You 're my inspiration , Emily . I 've always relied on your strength to get me through tough times . I just wish I knew where you got it from . My father . You remember him ? Yes . That 's good , Emily . What 's his name ? Tell me . David . His name is David Clarke . These were taken in the yacht 's main cabin moments after the shooting . Lydia 's nowhere to be seen , which contradicts her official statement . If you 're trying to frame her , I assure you , your plan is as foolhardy as it is desperate . Oh , I wo n't be framing Lydia . You will . He shot Emily . That 's absurd . Why would he ? Because she is a sick and venomous liar who toyed with his emotions . She broke him , Conrad . And when he finally learned the truth about her , he lashed out . My God . You 're serious . As serious as Daniel 's desire to protect me . He will confess unless we act . And we can not let him throw his life away for that vicious woman . Ah . Which leaves us one course of action . Lydia goes . It 's a terrible feeling , betraying someone you love . I 'm so pleased that you finally get to experience the sensation yourself . Hey . I thought you 'd be getting Carl by now . So did I . But now I 'm not so sure . This thing with Emily has really ... It 's really gotten to me . Yeah . Me , too . I 've been trying to help her , but the weirdest thing just happened . " Well , she ... I mean , she probably ... Saw you and then got mixed up , you know ? Maybe . She seemed so sure of it . It freaked me out . Charlotte , um , I think it might help if I see Emily . Look , she 's obviously confused . I think I can help her remember that she 's Emily Thorne and not ... someone else . There you are . Well ... I know everything that 's happened has been a nightmare . But I feel safe knowing that we 're handling it together . What 's wrong ? We 've been exposed . I have to revise my statement to the police . They 'll know I was lying . Yeah , well , Lydia , I have no choice . I mean , I 'm facing an obstruction of justice charge . Conrad , we 're talking about my life . Our life . I have n't done anything wrong . Oh , come on . What do you have to be concerned about ? After all , you 're ... You 're innocent , right ? So ... All you have to do is trust me . That 's what you said to David Clarke . Oh , come on . This is an entirely different situation . Do n't you think ? I 'm gon na look after you . So do n't do anything rash . And stay here , so ... I know where to find you . I 'll get that for you . - Thank you . - My pleasure . It 's done . She 's gone . That 's an interesting tattoo . What does it mean ? I 'm not sure . I saw you earlier . What 's your name ? Excuse me . Could you give us some privacy , please ? Sure . Emily , meet Jack . A statewide search is on for Lydia Davis , now the prime suspect in the brutal shooting of Emily Grayson . And I was forced to sacrifice all of it to protect you . Well , I did n't ask you to . I was handling it myself . You were ? What , by admitting that you shot your wife ? How very noble for you . It 's more than you would 've ever done . Have you lost your damn mind ? I just offered you freedom at my expense , and you meet it with reprobation ? Okay . All right , fine . But if that 's the case , the next time you find yourself in need of salvation , may I suggest that you drop to your knees and you pray ? Because from here on , your only hope will be divine intervention from the heavenly father himself because your earthly father is finished with you ! You do n't think I 've sacrificed ? ! Sara ? Well , there 's no accounting for taste . You say one more thing about her . I beg of you . Oh , you wan na take this out on me ? You better think again , because I am this close to showing you what I 'm truly capable of . Do it , ' cause I 've got nothing left to lose . What are you doing here , Niko ? Well , when I heard what happened to Emily Thorne , the news did n't mention anything about you . So I came to make sure you 're okay . Well , I had to go radio silent . You knew that . And why are you treating Emily ? That 's too risky for you . I 'm the best doctor you know . I saved your life when you got shot . Did n't I ? Yes . And for that , I owe you a debt . Which I plan on collecting . Well , you should n't have come . Well , I 'm here , so use me . Fine . You stay close to Emily . - But whatever you do ... - Do n't trust the Graysons . I know . I remember . Do you remember what I told you ? Yes . Nothing 's changed . You 're getting rid of it ? It 's been tarnished , and thus lost its unique appeal . I 'm sorry for letting you down . I ca n't tell you how to live your life , Patrick , or who to live it with . Do what makes you happy . I know what you 're doing . Someone hurts you , and you run . That 's your M.O . , right ? I 'm not gon na let you push me away . No , I told you before , we 're a team . So I 'm staying right here . He keeps this , um , box locked up behind the painting that he took from you . Uh , it 's got this design etched on the side of it . Two infinity symbols . They 're linked together . I swear I 've seen it before . Was it something like this ? It was exactly like that . There 's something so familiar about you . Well , we 've known each other for a very long time . Sort of . There 's kind of a big gap there . What happened ? I literally have no idea how to answer that question . I hate this . I feel so helpless . If it 's any consolation , you are the strongest person I have ever known . People keep saying things like that . I do n't feel it . Trust me . You are the toughest , most annoyingly bullheaded person on the planet . Emily , I 'll admit that there have been times I ... Never wanted to see you again . But ... Amanda . She was wearing it when she died . And you were there . I know you do n't remember this , but we had a big fight about it . We 've ... had a lot of fights this summer , actually . That 's my fault . I ... I 've been holding on to all that pain and ... And anger , and putting it on you . It 's not fair . I 'm so sorry . That 's what I wanted to say on the beach . Come back to us , Emily Thorne . Oh , my God . I 'm so sorry . Do n't be . Daniel . No . It 's Jack . Daniel . Daniel shot me . How did that gun get in your car ? The person who killed Lou . You know who that was ? Previously on " betrayal " ... It 's delicious . You do n't like it . You do n't have to lie just to be nice . Do you remember that night when you called me asking for help to find the magic book ? Lou mrozek was killed that night . Jack was standing next to me when I talked to you . I 'm here to make a confession . I killed Lou mrozek . I hear you have something to say about the mrozek murder . It was me . I killed Lou mrozek . Is that so ? Start at the beginning . Lou was embezzling from karsten allied . It had been going on for a while . It was over $1 million before we figured it out . I confronted him one night . Things got heated . I did n't know he carried a gun . For protection ? Well , he was paranoid , jumpy . It was stupid on my part . I should have anticipated it , but the gun surprised me . He pointed it at my chest . Without even thinking , I lunged , wrestled it from his hands , and shot him . It was n't ... Karsten ? Was he with you ? I did n't tell t.J . , but I followed him from the restaurant . Why ? Well , ' cause t.J . Was emotional . Lou was under siege . I wanted to make sure things did n't escalate . But they did ? But not until after t.J . Left . That 's when I approached Lou myself . And that 's when you shot him ? Yes . Like I told you , it was in self-defense . So ... To the best of your recollection , these are the events that took place on the night of September 27 , 2013 ? Yes . I swear , I just wanted to talk to him . Uh-huh . And things got out of hand . Yeah . I guess you could say things got out of hand . - - Captions by vitac - - 
@@5236341 Your wife ... nobody 's seen or heard from her in two and a half months . I will find out what you did to her . - How much you want , Javi ? - 300 Grand . I 'm sorry , smurf . You think I came all this way for 25 Grand ? Huh ? ! For the last Goddamn time , where 's the real money ? ! - I swear ! - How 'd you hurt your leg ? Eh ? No ! - Nicky . - Who took Nicky , J ? - Javi . - Aah ! Tell me where you are . We 'll come get you . Trailhead and ... and ash . - It 's where we buried him . - Who ? Javi 's father ... ? *ANIMAL KINGDOM* Season 02 Episode 07 Title : " Dig " . Working on a yacht ? I tell you what , you 're gon na make the world 's worst waiter . Then I 'll bartend . You kidding me with this ? Smurf again . Yeah . So as soon as we get the schedule , we pick the party with the highest rollers . I 'll do the few events , see what we find . Yeah . Just make sure you do n't get your ass fired on the first day . So what 's up ? Are we gon na need everybody on this ? I 'm on the inside . I 'll kill the engine and the radio . You three with guns to fleece the guests . Someone else to distract the coast guard . " 9-1-1 " ? Yeah , she probably forgot the Wi-Fi password . Why is she so pissed at you ? It 's the same old shit . When mama calls , just throw the phone in the fridge . Problem solved . Yo , we keep this job between us till we 're solid . - Yeah , I 'm cool with that . - All right . - Hey , it 's Deran . - Leave a message . Go get your brothers ! I can handle it here . Turn on the perimeter alarm . Watch the cameras . You feel better , baby ? Let me get you some ice packs . How do I find Javi ? Take a deep breath . J , what you 're feeling now is shame . There were four of them . There was nothing you could do . Nothing . Get in . You okay ? You talk to anyone ? Did you call anyone ? Did you call anyone ? - No , it ... uh , just ... Did they hurt you ? Hey . You 're safe now . Okay ? - I gave them your number . - Who ? I-I ... the ... the guy in charge . He ... he had a gun . - It 's okay . - I 'm sorry . It 's all right . J ? Hey . Who were those guys ? Did they hurt you ? No , he just put a ... He had a knife to my neck , but they did n't ... They did n't do anything . I 'm sorry , j . Okay . It 's okay . You feeling better ? Yeah . You know we 're never gon na let anything happen to you . You know that , do n't you ? Thank you . I need to talk to j for a minute . Why do n't you go take a nice hot shower , and I 'll have Craig bring you some oxys , okay ? - Okay . Pope fill you in on what happened ? What 's Javi got on you ? Uh , Luis was this dude ... He was Javi 's father ... And he used to run with Manny and I . We pulled a bank job . It was supposed to be super easy . But we had an unexpected visitor . We had a hero with a concealed 0.45 . Hero fires , hits Lou in the gut . Lou has a shotgun , takes hero 's head off . But Lou 's already bleeding out from the gut wound and , uh , he 's not gon na make it , hospital or no . So Manny just put him out of his misery . And then we drove the body to a construction site that ... I do n't know , someone just knew they were pouring the foundation for a house the next day . We buried him under it . You told us Lou ran off with the money . Except Jake put a gun in my face and took off with my money . Why the hell would you trust Jake ? I did n't have any options , did I ? Where 'd you get 300k ? My savings . You think he 's coming back ? Nah , he 's got ta know we 'd be waiting for him . So what if the cops find the body ? It 's been 20 years it 's been in the ground . And this ... this Manny guy 's the one who shot him , so why ... With my gun . He tossed it in with the body and told me about it the next day . Too late to do anything . The cops can link you to the gun ? Yep . So what do you want us to do about it ? We have to deal with Javi . - Deal with him ? - Yes . You were gon na pay him this afternoon . - Just pay him now . This has gone way past that now . For you , it 's gone way past that . Not for us . They almost killed J . But they did n't . He 's all right . And what do you want us to do exactly ? Huh ? What , you want us to hunt down this guy with assault rifles for some bullshit that you did that has nothing to do with us ? Do you have any idea what your life would 've been like if I took a murder rap when you were 5 years old ? Yeah , well , you know what ? Foster care would 've been better than this shit . You think so ? I 'll tell you about it sometime . Well , J , looks like your uncles do n't really give a damn about you , does it ? Nobody 's saying that , smurf . You 're saying that a group of people can come into our house and beat the shit out of him . If that were you lying there by the pool ... Yeah . Would we even be having this conversation ? We do n't just kill people . I mean , I 'm not finishing this conversation with her here , so let 's figure this out on our own . Just remember , Javi is not a little kid anymore . He 's angry and unstable . This does n't end until we end it . Make up your minds . Yeah , he 's ... he 's been following her and threatening her ever since Manny 's funeral . And you did n't say shit ? She asked me not to . You probably should 've shot his ass when he was in the Goddamn house . ' Cause then maybe we could say it was self-defense . - Deran . - What ? I 'm just sayin ' , if any of us had been here , we would n't be having this problem right now . - I 'm sorry ... - Yes . - Hey . Hey ! - All by myself ! Yes , that is what you do in that ... - situation . - Hey , leave the kid alone . I 'm not killing for her , pope . And you do n't have to . All right ? - We call the shots now . - Yeah , he 's right . Look at her . She thinks we 'll do it . She thinks we 'll do anything for her . And I 'll tell you one thing ... I 'm not doing life in prison for some 20-year-old bullshit that has nothing to do with me . Me neither . We move the body , we take the leverage . I saw the neighborhood when I picked up Nicky . We got ta get around the homeowners . We 've done riskier jobs . Man , I-I-I steal shit for money . - I do n't kill people for old debts . - She wo n't ! What is wrong with you , pope ? I thought you hated her . No one in this family is going to prison ... Oh , yeah ? Not if they do n't have to . When you went to prison , she was relieved . - She was relieved . - Dude , shut up ! She 's not going to prison . I 'm trying . So ? We 're not killing anyone . We 're gon na move the body . What ? He ca n't threaten you if he does n't have anything . We 're gon na move the body . J 's gon na be pissing blood for weeks . This is n't just about leverage . That 's the best you 're gon na get . And when he comes back ? If he comes back , we will deal with it . And you have to pay them . Pay who ? Deran and Craig want to be paid for their services . - No . That 's a nice way to run things , baz . Try and get some rest . Hey , hang back a minute . I got ta talk to you . I need you to take point on this one . Oh , she 's just trying to get in my head . No , man , listen . I got pulled over this afternoon . Yeah , I 'm trying to stay calm , and the guy , he starts asking me about Cath . And he says he 's gon na find out what I did to her . Man , she had a bank account she never told me about . She has n't touched it since she left . - Jesus . - Yeah . Anyway , I ca n't go near the body . I-I 'm not sure if they 're watching me or not . Yeah . Yeah , okay . The cops think she 's dead . What do you think ? Yeah , I think she 's dead . I 'm sorry . Beer ? Oh , no . You know what ? I 'm ... I 'm kinda tired . Yeah . Uh ... Okay . - I 'll come and check on you later . - Mm-hmm . Thanks . How 's she doing ? You think they 're gon na come back ? Nah , not tonight . Pope 's been walking around with that shotgun . What , you think they would 've killed smurf if she was here ? That 's why he 's got the shotgun . Hey . I 'm gon na take the couch tonight . Smurf gave j my room . I 'll sleep with Lena . So , look , did Javi say anything else to you ? Um , anything you can tell us that would help us ? Anything at all ? Smurf was supposed to pay them , but did n't show . They came here looking for money . What 'd you tell ' em ? They had Nicky in the other room . Do n't let smurf get you killed . You played it right , man . If you 'd come out shootin ' , you and Nicky would both be dead . Get some sleep . You know , I expected this halfway bullshit from your brothers , but you ? A cop stopped baz this afternoon . They think he killed Cath . - Smurf up ? - I do n't know . You 've been sitting here all night ? We need the concrete saw and the sledgehammers back . Okay . You get the truck ? Yeah , I talked to Nico . We 're all good . This is how it starts , you know ? We do this for her , next thing you know , we 're right back here , and she 's running shit . Get the tools . Anybody want scrambled eggs ? How was the couch ? Okay ? I 'll see you in a couple hours . Could you take Nicky and j with you ? Javi 's not coming back . We leave in five . Come here . Ally said she 'd take you to the beach . Okay ? Here you go . Hey . Come here . Come here . I 'm gon na be back tomorrow , okay ? - Okay . - Okay . I 've been gone a lot , right ? It 's okay . You can say it . Yeah . Okay , we 'll do something together this week . Just you and me . How ' bout that ? Why ? Why ? ' Cause I 'm your dad and I want to , that 's why . - Okay . - Okay . Come on . Sorry this is so last minute . I wo n't make a habit out of it . I do n't mind . See you tomorrow . Okay . Javi . Where . All right , you guys go wait over there . Do n't touch anything . Come on . The cops do n't know anything . If they did , you 'd already be in cuffs . What are we doing here ? What ... what are the tools for ? Yeah . You know , I went for Smurf 's gun . And I would 've used it . I just could n't figure out how to load it . I never want to feel like that again . Hey . You remember when we were kids , we used to fight over the game boy ? Smurf would make us hit each other over and over again - till one of us quit ? - Yeah . I always used to kick your ass . Uh , you were scrappy . No , you were huge , even when you were 6 . You used to let me win . Did n't wan na kill you . Smurf would get so pissed . She thought I 'd never learn how to fight . She 'd sic pope on you . Well , do n't feel bad . But she loved when we fought . Yeah . It 's Nico . Hey . What 's up , man ? We good ? - It 's in the alley . - All right , let 's go . Uniforms ? - In the back . - All right . All right , so we 'll drop the car off at the airport long-term parking . You can pick it up tomorrow morning , okay ? All right , look , no blood in my truck . - Just picking up some old shit . - Thanks , Nico . Got a couple more things to do in the office , then we 'll get out of here , okay ? All right . Okay , so the bullets are in the clip . Wan na push that in there ... - all the way until it clicks . Okay . - Mm-hmm . All right , now ... Pull it up . Keep your finger on the side there . There you go . Okay , now that 's ready to fire , so be careful . Well , how do I aim it ? See these white dots ? Mm-hmm . You wan na line those up right where you wan na shoot , okay ? Bring your elbows in , turn your body to the side a little bit . There you go . And then , when you 're ready , you just keep firing until the clip runs out . Thank you . Do n't let Deran see that in here . Put it away . We got ta go . - That 's the one . - Are you sure ? I have n't been here in 20 years . I was n't expecting to come back , either . We 're not going in unless you 're sure . That 's it . That 's the one . It 's right next to the drainage ditch on the southeast side of the street . Whose idea was this place ? Jake 's . I thought you ran that crew . Manny shot him , Jake buried him , and you just ... Watched . I 'm sorry to hear about Julia . What the hell are you doing , Javi ? You remember this place ? We used to smoke a lot of shit down here . You , me , and pope . Yeah , I remember . She tell you about my dad ? Yeah , she did . What 'd she say ? That Manny did it ? She shot him in the back of the head , then threw his body in a hole , and then told me my dad was a piece of shit who ran out on me . Okay , so what do you want to do about it ? You wan na kill her ? ' Cause we 're never gon na let that happen . So if you want something else , let 's start negotiating . Man , you know , every birthday , Christmas , I thought , " oh , this is it . Bro , I spent the last 20 years wiping Manny 's ass and doing small-time 211 's in the middle of Goddamn nowhere . You know and smurf seems like she 's just doing fine , man , like she did n't lose no sleep . So do you wan na go back to Arizona with nothing , or do you wan na get paid ? I already tried . I asked for money . She did n't show . She 's not running things anymore . I can get you the money . Hmm . Keys to the kingdom , huh ? How does pope feel about that ? Well , he does n't feel great about you threatening smurf , I 'll tell you that . Look , you took 25 from the house . It 's gon na cost at least 10 to fix the wall , plus the bullshit with the kid and the girlfriend . - Let 's call it 200 . Come on . I 'm trying to help you here , man . It 's 200 or it 's nothing . Those are your choices . What do you wan na do ? You remember when your dad used to get loaded and kick the shit out of you in front of Smurf 's yard ? Man , you 've come a long way from crying yourself to sleep and pissing the bed , man . Good for you . ' Cause , you know , shit did n't turn out so well for me or my dad . It 's all right . You know , Manny used to always say that smurf would climb over her own kids just to keep from drowning . Be careful , bro . That 's all I 'm saying . You 're not even her kid . So we have a deal . Good . The body 's buried along the back wall . The gun with it ? - Should be . - Should be ? It is . I 'm sorry , baby . Would you give us another second , please ? I 'm not stupid . I know who you are . I know what you do . You 're right . You 're a smart girl . And we should tell you the truth . Thanks . But not now . Next time . Now do you have someplace else you can sleep tonight ? - Yeah . - Okay , go get packed . Tools ? - Yeah . - Truck ? Parked it down the street . You got ta pay Javi . 200 instead of 300 because of what he did to j . I know you do n't like it , and you do n't have to , but it 's what we got ta do right now . I 'm sorry . And that 's fair , smurf . You owe him . Okay . When ? Two hours . Are you sure you should go with her ? She 's not going alone . What about the cops ? - If I get a tail , I 'll lose it . - Yeah . - Good luck . - You , too . So where 'd you get the money to pay Javi ? I told you . My savings . Mm , that 's bullshit . You 've been skimming off our work . I 'm the only one in this family who can see past the next Goddamn party . Okay . Great , so time to dip back in . Do I drive you to a bank ? How does it work ? You really think I have more , do n't you ? Jake took everything I have , and Javi cleaned out this house . Well , did n't you boys just come into a bit of church money ? Smurf , you got ta be kidding me . Well , we could show up with nothing and see how he takes it . Let 's go . Hi . Good afternoon , ma'am . Uh , there were reports of a gas leak in the area . We have to ask you to leave while we make sure everything 's okay . The bruises will get worse before they get better . And you 're gon na need proper stitches in that leg . I can do it for you , if you want . It 's up to you . I know you think we should kill him . But have you ever hurt somebody ? Really hurt them ? Does n't feel like you think it will . Thank you . Down there on the left . I 'll get the tools . Got a new car ? It 's a loaner . Challenger needs a new transmission . Baz , how do you know we 're not driving straight into an ambush ? He 'll take the money . Bingo . Pipe . We got a hit . Gun . Shit , how much gas did you guys pour in here ? All right , let 's tear it up . Stop . What 's going on here ? Wait here . What 's he doing here ? Hey , there 's two of you . Are we gon na have a problem ? Why do n't you tell her to get out of the car ? Javi ... Got your money right here . I wan na talk with her . Javi , your dad 's been dead for 20 years . She is never gon na say she 's sorry . Take the money . Gun . That 's it . What , did this guy only have one foot ? We 're missing one . Shit . Man , it 's not here . Keep digging . Look , man , we have the gun . Huh ? We 're not leaving without a Goddamn foot . Get out of the way . Guys , we got a bunch of neighbors on the front lawn , asking questions . Pope . What do you want me to do ? Maybe it 's not even here . It 's got ta be there . Where else could it be ? I 'm telling you , cops are n't going to ID a foot . Let 's just leave it . Shut up . Okay , well , we got about 15 minutes before the old lady calls dispatch and finds out there 's no leak . I 'm moving as fast as I can . Wait . Hey , is that it ? There we go . Good job , bro . Let 's get the hell outta here . Got it ? - Javi ? - Get out of here . Go . I really do owe you an explanation , huh ? You know all that bullshit about me not having any room ? That was just silly . I did n't take you in because you were worthless . Bury the body over the fence . Get rid of your gun . Here you go . That 's it . That 's all you 're getting . Is that all in there ? It 's there . The other 50 is in a building on ventura . It 's called the Lisbon . Mailbox 5c . Get it out of there tonight , and get yourself out of California . Well , we 're all done in there . We had to , uh , dig up part of the floor to get to the pipe . But , uh , dispatch will give you a call , send someone out to patch it up . But thank you so much . You 've been very kind . Do n't expect me to help you when this comes back to bite us ! I 'm not doing it ! You would n't do what needed to be done . I found someone who would . We have the body ! He was gon na take the money ! You do n't know that . - You don't . - His own crew knew that ! They wanted the money . He just wanted revenge . And it was n't very difficult to convince Deek to take him out . I mean , come on , smurf . We grew up with that kid . He was like family to us . And " like family " is n't family . Yeah . You are family . Come on . So what did you say ? " There 's an 8-foot hole in your ground . Sorry ? " I told her , uh , dispatch would give her a call , that we 're , uh , gon na send over Ronny to come fix it tomorrow . You know , fat Ronny , our best guy . Everything all right ? Synchronized by srjanapala . face the fire . let it go . on the edge ... How are you doing ? Been thinking about my grandmother a lot . Yeah . She was about to turn 97 . At least she lived a very long and I 'm sure very happy life . Got you this card . When you 're ready , we all signed it . We just wanted you to know we 're thinking about you . Thank you . " Congratulations , Darryl . Let 's get wasted . " Have fun today , big guy . " Aww , yeah . Party time . " It 's possible that some people thought it was your birthday . " Hooray . Live it up , big d . " Days like this do n't come often enough . " Time to celebrate . You deserve this " ? Birthday punches ! 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... I 'm so sorry . 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ... Rachel from the party ? Oh , yeah . Nice . Do the damn thing . Pow ! Blue wasabi is so good , but get the cheeseburger . They say they wo n't do it , but they will if you make a scene . - Okay , bye . - Okay , bye . - I 'll miss you . - Miss you . - Mwah . - Okay . I 'll be in my office if you need me . Mwah . Bye . - Okay , bye . - Bye . - All right , bye . Bye . - Bye . Okay , one more quick one . Do n't go . I do n't want you to go . - Oh , do n't go . - Mwah . Do n't go . Holly and I are dating . It 's been a week , and I still ca n't believe it . It goes to show that everything you want in life , you get . And you ca n't work for it . That 's you . Come on . I dominate Valentine 's day . I practically make romance into a science . " Roses are red . Violets are blue . Look in the vase to find your first clue . " Oh , my gosh . It 's a romantic scavenger hunt . Oh , close . It 's a romantic treasure hunt . A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list . This is where you follow the clues that lead to a prize . Common misuse . Good luck . But there 's no clue . Well , get to work . I ca n't , ' cause there 's no clue . The puzzle is the clue . Are these numbers correct ? The numbers are correct , Michael . Okay . Are you ... are you sick , Oscar ? Do you need to go home ? ' Cause you 're grossing me out . I just need a signature . There you go . Thanks . Thank you . What ? I 'm missing my scarf . We decided to have a Valentine 's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine 's day dinner thing . It 's a whole thing . - Yeah , lunch was wonderful ! - Shh . Um , there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue ... Station . And what else was there ? Um , bottomless champagne . Yes . Never found that bottom , did we ? No . What 's up ? Are you good at jigsaw puzzles ? Are you kidding me ? It 's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing . Okay . But if this is a romantic thing with Gabe , I should probably ... oh ! No , no , no , no . It 's not weird at all . You have your new girlfriend . I have Gabe . This is just as friends . Well , okay then . Yes ! I accidentally did his sudoku . Andy . All right . I will fax over it to you . Whoop . I will fax it over to you . Okay . Thank you . Okay , my name is j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you ... under you . I 'll fax it under you . Oh , excuse me . I just p-p-p-p-pissed my pants . Not really . I did n't really . Wait . You 're just filling that out right now . That was n't meant for me . I will not be your Valentine . Aww , nuts . I do n't know if anyone else feels this way ... and do n't get me wrong ... I love Michael and Holly . And maybe I 'm being overly sensitive ... But the PDA . Yes ! The freaking PDA ! - Uh-huh . - Thank you ! I mean , I 'm thrilled for them . No one is more thrilled for them than I am ... Yes . Yes , absolutely . So happy . Yeah . I do n't know , guys . I , for one , enjoy watching them , because ... - No , stop . Just don't . - Kevin ! Can I finish ? Can I finish ? Is that okay ? I was saying ... I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny . God ! Kevin ! So tell me about your new girlfriend . She 's neat . Uh , I met her at Darryl 's cousin 's party . We were the only two white people there . Aww , cute . Hey , look at that . Done . That 's Gabe 's boom box . Come on . We have to go find it . I wish you well on your quest . - No , come on . - Aww , I mean ... come on ! - Okay . - Ha ! I hear them kissing all the time . It 's this horrible plipping sound . You know , it 's like Chinese water torture . Just ... Ohh . Can you get lower ? - Oh , yeah . - A little lower . I can not keep myself from Michael . Everything he does is sexy . He has this undeniable animal magnetism . He 's a jungle cat . The man exudes sex . He can put both his legs behind his head . Thank you all for meeting on such short notice . Yes ? Yes . Michael Scott , Dunder Mifflin . What is the purpose of this meeting ? Seeing as it 's Valentine 's day , I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace . Perfect . Yes . It is quite apro-propriate . Carry on . First things first . An office romance is permissible . Not something you 'd expect to hear from corporate ? Well , guess what . Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances . Speaking of , Gabe , I do n't see Erin at this meeting . Uh , I also do n't see Andy . Boom ! Very funny . What I do not approve of , however , is public displays of affection , or PDAs . PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy , healthy office romance . Perfect example . Look at Jim and Pam . Yeah ? What ? Us ? They do n't touch . They do n't kiss . You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife . - Did it . - Yeah ! Love it . Keep going . Okay . So , PDAs . That 's gon na include behaviors such as hugging , kissing , Booby honking . Yeah , booby honking . Sure . Butt honking . Butt honking . Yeah , all the honkings . The one where you start in a crouched position , then you leap ... Sure . Basically , there 's no precise definition , but you know it when you see it . Are you guys listening to this ? What , are you talking about me and Holly ? Yeah ! Maybe you find your own chair . So we kiss occasionally ... It 's the flirtatious whispering . The flirtatious tickling . Whispering and tickling have their place in business . That thing where you softly exhale on her neck . Okay , yeah , that 's pretty hot . I will give you that . Look , you are all hypocrites . You all do it . Michael . I have done PDA in the office . Thank you . I 've had intercourse in the office . - All right . - As has Angela . - Dwight . - As has Ryan . As has Kelly . As has Meredith . As has Phyllis . As has Darryl . As has creed . As has Michael . And as has Holly . As has Kevin . With who ? She goes to another school . Okay . Fine . No more PDA . - Good . - You win . But here 's what we are gon na do . We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone . - No . - Anything goes . No , no , we 're gon na have three closets , one for each base , no homers . Yes ? - And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation ? - Pro . - Yes . What ? Problem solved . No , no , it 's great . I love working at Dunder Mifflin , a division of Taliban enterprises . That is weird . I mean , that 's weird to have sex in the office . That 's where you work , right ? You know , you 're in a meeting , and nobody knows that you 've had sex there , except for you and him . Do n't mind us . You keep working . Okay . I 'll keep working . Oh , my God . It 's a song . What do you think is on it ? We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad . I think he 's just being nice . That makes sense , ' cause I feel like I 'd be able to hear us at this level . Darryl . Darryl is a jerk . - No , he 's not . - No , I 'm just testing if he can hear . I can hear you . - Oh . Okay . - Okay . Then no more talking . Let 's just play the song . ? The temp at night . the temp at night . the temp at night . the temp at night ? Temp at night ? What do you ... you got it . Pick it up . Take it out . Pi ... - pick it up . - Okay . Take it out . Pick it up . Pick it up . Pick it up . Take it out . Right . Okay . Sorry to interrupt . Forgot to collect my things . Ah , the old " leave behind . " Oldest trick in the book . Since when is comfort the most important thing ? I mean , I do n't sit on your lap because it 's comfortable . I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt . Yeah , but if they 're uncomfortable , it makes me uncomfortable . Oh . Okay . Well , if it makes you uncomfortable , then we 'll stop . Okay . Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet . And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart . Hey . You know the only reason why people here are complaining ? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine 's day . Two people in love ? I love you . Wait , wait , wait , what do you mean you love me ? We 've only been dating for a week . Do you mean you love me like , " oh , hey , there 's Holly . - Wow , you love me-love me . I love you-love you . I am really disappointed in the office 's policy on PDA at this moment . I love you . I love you . Yeah , whatever . No big deal . Just the hottest girl in the world loves me . Okay , Ryan 's the temp . What does he do at night ? I guess we just have to wait until night and see . Oh . Or maybe not . Cool . - How romantic is this ? - Super romantic . Right ? Do you see a clue or ... Yeah . Did you not see it ? - Oh , my gosh . - Hanks . Hey . No time to chat . - Sorry . - Well , we were just looking for Ryan , so he 's not here . Hey . You 're looking for me ? Oh , yeah , we were . We were just looking to say hi . So hey . - No , you weren't . - No . - Definitely not . That 's disgusting . It 's cool . Just try to put everything back where you found it . Text me when you 're finished . I 'll be out here . Hey , you do n't have to ... That was so embarrassing I 'm gon na die . That was really rough . Let me make something clear . Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office . No , because the office is n't what I 'd consider a romantic place . Besides , we have something those other people do n't have , which is a home and a bed . And a shower . - Hello , Holly . - Hello . Here , shake ... no ! - No , do n't touch . - No , we can't . - No touching . - No touching . Ah , I 'm trying not to touch you . - Almost got you . - Oh , no , so close . Oh . No , we ca n't do that . I do n't know what your body feels like . ' Cause I ca n't touch it . Okay , this is much worse than before . Yeah , I agree . This is nasty . - Grab you here . - And here . And I will grab you here anyway . You have to cut it out . - Never . - Okay . You said you would . I did say I would , but I was wrong . I ca n't stop . You do n't know what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back . It is a feeling that can not and will not and frankly can not be contained . No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me . But with you two , it 's reaching the level of a complex . I can think of three explanations . You 're taking MDMA ... street name , ecstasy . I 've done it , and I know the feeling . No . I do n't think so . You 're at an age where your sexual climaxes are n't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay , taboo behavior . Yes , it was that . It 's that one . Yes . Number three . Give me all your money and take off your clothes . We 're not supposed to PDA . Come on . Nobody 's looking . What 's wrong ? I had n't thought about you having to go back to nashua . Maybe we did n't want to think about it . We can make it work . We 'll date long-distance . That 's what we said last time . Remember ? We broke up on the drive . How 's this gon na be any different ? We were n't in love last time . I was in love with you . I 'm not saying it wo n't be hard . But we can make it work . That 's what she said . One Erin special , please . I 'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mid-hunt break and look for a heart or some  In the break room when you 're through . Hey , buck up , buddy . Make that face he likes . Hey . Hey . Come on . You 're hurting him . It 's like a time bomb ... - Shh . - Is ticking down . When it goes off , no more kissing . No more hugging . Just hush . Sexual time bomb . Just rock . Shh . Boner bomb starring Jason Statham . Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera . - Movie idea ? - No . Saving the world has never been this hard . Okay . Shh . Have you talked to her about our feelings ? Women really go for that crap . No , I ca n't talk to her . I ca n't even look at her without thinking about it ending . Kevin . Do more stupid faces . Which one ? I have a lot of stupid faces . - Do a monkey face . - I love that . I love that face . Good . He loves it . Good . Jump . Jump up and down . - No . The monkey ! - Go back to the monkey . Do n't do the squirrel . Throw your poop . Hurl your feces . That 's good . - Good . - That 's good . He 's throwing it . They really do that . I know . - B-9 . - B-9 . Like benign tumor . Maybe it 's just more like , " be mine . " Oh , yes . There 's a note . " A little cookie for you , my miss . But the real treasure is your Valentine 's kiss . " Oh . We 're supposed to ... Holly . Hey . - Hi . - Holly , I love you so , so , so much . And I think that we need to break up . What ? What are you talking about ? Actually it 's Valentine 's day . No , we 're gon na talk now . You 're not breaking up with me . You 're gon na go back to nashua eventually , and I ca n't handle it . So let 's just ... let 's ... what if I said it was n't up to them ? - Who ? - The company . Nobody knows our future , but it 's not gon na be decided by the company . It 's not gon na be decided by anybody but us . What we are is up to you and me . Okay . Okay . Ladies and gentlemen , I have an announcement to make . As of today , officially , Holly and I are moving in together . Thank you . Thank you . Oscar , this must be tough for you , watching this go down . You could not stand in the way of true love , my friend . Are you kidding ? I was n't trying to break you guys up . Better luck next time , pal . So I bid you all adieu . - You do ? - I do . Go on . Kiss each other already . Suck it , Oscar . This must kill you . I just told them to do it . - What ? - No . No . We took a walk . We took a walk . My perfect Valentine 's day ? I 'm at home , three cell phones in front of me , fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago . Anybody can be prince charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that . But you know what impresses me ? When a guy can do that no days a year . Flowers , diamonds , three course meal ..... What are our plans for tonight ? 
@@5236841 Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime , Dr . Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator ... and vanished . He awoke to find himself trapped in the past , facing mirror images that were not his own ... and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better . His only guide on this journey is Al , an observer from his own time , who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear . And so , Dr . Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life , striving to put right what once went wrong ... and hoping each time that his next leap ... will be the leap home . What the hell ? You heard me . ! Hands up ! Everyone stay calm . We 'll get this over with and be on our way . Keep me covered while I shut the blinds . Do n't fall apart on me now , little brother . Oh , boy .

Out of town on business . He wo n't be back till later this afternoon . Damn it ! Maybe we should go on and get out of here fore things get out of hand . We just , uh-W-W-We go out that back door over there . What 's that ? What 's it sound like ? Nobody move ! Willie , you check out the back . John , watch the door . Nobody move ! Just keep those hands nice and high where I can see ' em . Nobody . Somebody must be in that back office . I 'll take a look . That was stupid . That was really stupid ! Take it easy . Yelling at her is not gon na do any good . Come on . Get out of there . Go on . All right . All right ! Somebody turn that alarm off . Turn it off ! All right . Come on . Move ! Back over there .

How do I keep getting into these situations ? Do n't look at me . What 's going on , Al ? Huh ? You 're William Walters Jr . , but everybody calls you " Willie . " It 's the 22nd of December , 1971 . Where am I ? You 're home , Sam . You 're in Elk Ridge , Indiana . I 'm - I 'm home ? Mm-hmm . No wonder everything seemed so familiar . Yeah . Well , your memory 's a little Swiss-cheesed , you know . It 's ' 71 . My dad 's still alive . I'm_I 'm home and-and ... my dad 's still alive . Willie Walters ? I knew a guy named Willie , Willie Walters . Uh , a couple years older than me . Well , the big one is Neil . He 's a couple years older than you . He 's a loose cannon . He enlisted in the Marine Corps in ' 69 , and then he took a compassionate discharge a year later . Why ? Uh , oh , his father died , and he came back to take charge of the family farm . Uh , the younger one is John . He 's still in high school . He 's never been in any kind of trouble . Yeah , until now . What about Willie ? Willie - Indiana State University , honor student . He did n't come back home in time . In time for what ? Uh , to save the family farm from foreclosure . Seems they were late a couple of months on a loan . $37,893- And 19 cents . Wh-They 're robbing the bank to pay the bank ? Well , that has a certain symmetry to it . More like insanity . I do n't believe this . Ziggy says there 's an 88.9% chance ... that you 're here to see that the brothers surrender . Look , uh , ask Ziggy what happens to the farm after they lost it . What ? Hey . You 're not thinking of going through with bank robbery ? Just ask Ziggy what happened . Willie . Willie , you better get out here . Hello ? Willie , is that you ? Now look , son , you might as well talk to me . Everybody saw you and your brothers go into the bank . Hello , Chief Mundy . How ya been ? How 've I been ? Willie-I 've been fine until now .

He made the loan . He can unmake it . You said it looked like we did n't get a fair deal . Hello , Chief ? Yeah . Uh , we were wondering if we could talk to Mr . Vernon . I mean , if that would be possible . Gus Vernon ? He 's in Harker Falls . Need time to get him back here . Well , you better hurry up then . Nice talking to you again . Again ? Billy . I want you to take that motorcycle of yours ... and go over to Harker Falls and get Gus Vernon back here . Now go on . Oh , Flo ? Can you give me a piece of that pecan pie ? Oh , sure , Sheriff . Look out . Just relax , Carl . We 've got everything under control . Relax ? My wife is in there . I wan na know what you plan to do about this . Well , I plan on finishing my coffee and having a piece of pie . Then I plan on waiting for Gus Vernon . Wh-What about Cindy ? I mean , y-you got ta get her outta there . Thank you , Flo . That 's all you 're gon na do then ? Wait ? That 's all I can do . I suggest you go on home and do the same thing , Carl . I do n't believe this . What kind of man are you anyway ? A patient man . Go on now , fore I lose it . Why do n't you boys take those silly things off your faces ? We all know who you are . We get up before the sun , and we do n't rest till after dark . Then along comes Gus Vernon . He tells you you ai n't gon na make it unless you increase the yield . Modernize , he says . Well , you 're afraid oflosing the only thing you got . So you go along , and you make the deal . But somehow , no matter how hard you work , you ca n't keep up . Pretty soon you 're selling off milk cows to make the next payment . It was just business . Well , we 'd like to hear Gus Vernon ... explain that kind of business to us face-to-face . Yeah , I 'd love to hear that . Sam , it turns out that the Walters farm was one of six parcels bought at auction by an out-of-state developer ... who went on to build the largest shopping center in the whole tri-county area , and Vernon made a fortune in kickbacks . Do n't sound crazy to me . Sounds like a banker . - What the hell you talking about ? - Sam , we should talk . Look , I 'll explain everything . I just , uh-- I just need a minute . - You got to go again ? Yeah , I just need a second to-to think . Uh-Uh , I 'll be right back . Sam , I know that look . What look ? What look ? That look . The " I 'm gon na save the world " look . Ziggy says this leap 's over as soon as the brothers surrender . I ca n't do that . What do you mean you ca n't ? Maybe I 'm not making myself clear here . I 'm talking life and death here . So am I . Do n't you get it , Al ? It does n't matter if you kill a man with a gun or with a pen . In the end , he 's still dead . I 'm home , Al . Do n't tell me . Tell them . I know that you 're sympathetic with the situation here because it 's your hometown ... and all of that , but Ziggy says there 's a 73.9% chance ... that if you surrender , you 'll leap . Leap ? Why would I want to leap ? I 'm home . But you 're here to save the brothers , right ? So ? You got to turn yourself in . Right ? So . Let 's go . Right ? I ca n't . Eh-How did I know he was gon na say that ? I ca n't have been put here to save their lives and then leave ' em with nothing , Al . I mean , their farm is all they got . But Ziggy says- Oh , forget about Ziggy . Forget about Ziggy . Al . My dad worked our farm 16 hours a day , seven days a week . It was his life . Exactly . I was n't ... even there . Maybe I could have ... helped him save what he worked so hard to build , but I was n't there . I 've had to carry that around with me my whole life . I do n't want Willie to have to do the same thing . Okay . If you had it to do over again , you 'd do things differently . But it 's a little late , is n't it ? Is it ? See , that 's what I 'm thinking , Al . Maybe I 've been put here to have a second chance . A second chance ? Yeah . I mean , it 's pretty clear that ... Vernon 's motives , not to mention his methods , are suspect , right ? So ? What if we can prove that Vernon manipulated the loans ? You said Neil was n't on top of things . What if we can prove that he took advantage of Neil and the others ... Well , there 's got to be some way we can link him up with the deal , you know ? L - I just ca n't walk away again , Al . Okay . I 've got to try . Okay . I will go back and-and try and get Ziggy to come up with something . Thanks . I better - I better get back out there . Who knows , you know ? I mean , maybe , um- maybe if this all works out okay , and I do n't leap right away , um , maybe I could go see my family . Could I have your attention , please ? I know this is n't exactly how you planned on spending your holidays , but ... I just want you to know that my brothers and I ... have no intention ofletting any of you get hurt . Mr . Right . Hey ! Stay away from the window . We should n't have brought him . Why ? He 's got just as much at stake as anybody else . Hey now , what was you saying before about Vernon wanting our land ? I think he knew that we could never make those payments when he made us the loan . He set us up . You mean me , do n't ya ? No . I did n't say that . Yeah . You did n't have to . I do n't mean to tell ya how you do your bank robbing ' , but would you mind pointing that peashooter you got in a different direction ? Yeah . I'm- I 'm sorry , Mr . Pierce . Mr . Pierce . Mr . And Mrs . Pierce . You folks had that dairy farm just a couple miles from-You 've lived around here for a long time , have n't ya ? 54 years . That 's great . Listen , uh , do you by any chance know , uh , the Beckett family ? John Beckett ? Oh , yeah . Everybody in this part of the county knows John and Thelma Beckett . Fine family . One of their boys just came back from Vietnam . Tom . Uh , his name is Tom . Um , when was the last time you saw Mr . Beckett ? Uh , let 's see . I ran into him at Benning 's Hardware store just two days ago . How 'd he look ? Same as usual . I remember one time , uh , Stan was away , and I took sick , and John drove me to the doctor , waited over an hour , and then he drove me home . He 's a fine man . Yes , he is . You know my sister . Mandy Greer ? She was in your history class . You must remember . She had long , red hair and braces . She played Captain ... Hook . Gee , that was a long time ago . How 's she doin ' ? She got her braces off . Oh . She still wears the patch . I see . Well-Oh . I 'm really sorry that you got mixed up in all of this . That 's all right . My daddy lost his place a while back . The way I see it , Gus Vernon has it coming . Beth ! Well , he does . I do n't know why you 're always protecting that man . Because he is our boss , that 's why . We would n't have a job if it was n't for him . Oh . Some job . Two dollars an hour , no benefits ... and you . I should 've never quit the Dairy Queen . If you ask me , that 's where you belong . At least I do n't have to sleep with the boss to keep my job . - You little bitch . Please . Just-Oh ! You all right ? Baby 's kickin ' . You know , we do n't need to keep you here with us . We can just go ahead and let you go . Nobody 's going anywhere ! She 's pregnant , okay ? That 's why she 's here . Mundy 's not gon na make a move as long as she stays here . If we let her go , he 'll see we 're willing to deal . He 'll also see that we 're weak . You 're losing sight of your objectives here . Use your head . What is that supposed to mean ? Willie ! Vernon 's here . Look at him . Crisp as a hundred dollar bill . - Excuse me . - It was about time you got here . What the hell 's going on , Clyde ? One minute I 'm doing business , the next I hear my bank 's being robbed . Well , first of all , your bank is n't being robbed . I did n't drive 30 miles to get a lesson in semantics . Now , who 's in there ? Bill Walters 's boys . Who ? Is it that easy to forget ? Mary , what are you doing here ? There 's a law against a mother wanting to be near her children ? What 's this all about ? - Murder . - Murder ? - Who 's been murdered ? - A way of life . Mary , look . We all know , uh , how hard it 's been for you since you lost Bill , but this is n't gon na bring him back . Now do your boys a favor . - Tell them to come on out . - No , sir . - They are breaking the law . - What would you know about the law ? And you , Clyde Mundy , ought to be ashamed siding with his type . I am trying to do my job . We 're not the first to go under here . And we wo n't be the last . Now , I was born in this county . Most of these folk here were . And I 'll be damned if I 'm gon na sit here and let the likes of you ... steal it out from under us . No , sir . My boys stay right where they are . And they stay there with my blessing . Why the hell does n't he call ? - Just give him some time . - You do n't think they 'll try anything funny ? I say we fire off a couple rounds . Let ' em know we 're still here . Give me this . Hey , give it back . I 'll give it to you later . Hey , I 'm still the oldest in this family . Then why do n't you start acting like it ? You 're so full of yourself , are n't you ? Big college boy . Come home and fix everything . Leave him outta this . What 's it feel like to know everything about everything ? This is n't the time or the place . Why , you going somewhere ? Yeah . I 'm gon na let you cool off . Neil , come on . Oh , that 's it . Run away ! You 're good at that , are n't you ? I wonder if Pop might not still be alive if you had n't took off the way you did . That 's enough . That man lived for you . John and I were his sons , but you were his life . And when he needed you most , you were n't even there . I did n't know . Did n't know or did n't care . Do n't ever say that again . After only a few hours , it was obvious that my life and Willie 's had taken similar paths . It was also becoming clear that the line separating us was beginning to blur . Kind of a long day , huh ? Yeah . You scared ? What ? Just want to know if you 're scared . No . Are you ? Yeah . I 'm scared . Look , I 'm sorry about what happened before . I should n't have hit him . You know , I just , uh - I lost it . It ? My temper . This is all kind of sudden for me . He - He did n't mean what he said . Well , sure sounded like it to me . It-It has n't been easy for him since Pop died . If I tell you something , will you promise not to repeat it to anyone ? Uh , sure . A few weeks ago we were working on the tractor . All of a sudden , Neil hops off and tells me to get in the truck . Next thing I know , we 're at Pop 's grave . Must 've spent two hours just sittin ' there . Just sittin ' there . All of a sudden , Neil starts talkin ' about you . ' Bout- ' Bout-'Bout how much he admired you . How proud he was that you were making something of yourself . And he said , uh , that you were too smart to get trapped like he did . That life was too short to spend it miserable ... and full of regret . And ... then he- he cried . Sam ? Look , I 'm gon na go stretch my legs . Can I get you something ? You need anything ? Kathy Campbell 's phone number . Willie ? I lied . I am scared . Seems pretty calm out there right now . Yeah . Like right before a tornado . Did Ziggy come up with anything ? Uh , well , there was nothing ever officially registered between Vernon and the developer . Nada . He 's too smart for that . Yeah . And if there 's anything linking him to the deal , he 's keeping it pretty close to the vest . All right . I got to get out of here then . Now wait . There 's a deputy guarding the back entrance , but Ziggy 's been running some escape scenarios . She says your best shot is to create some kind of diversion . Diversion ? Al , take a look around . I 'm stuck in this bank . How am I gon na create a diversion ? Are you gon na be much longer ? Let me get this straight . You want me to go out the door , and when I get in the middle of the street , pretend to go into labor ? That 's right . Does n't sound too difficult . Wait a second . ! You 're not really going to do this ? You sure that Vernon 's guilty ? Positive . It 's just gon na take more than my word to prove it . Do n't you see what he 's doing ? He 's just trying to use you to get away . Do n't be stupid . ! I 'm coming out . ! Come on , Beth . It 's all right , hon . Come on . Now , Beth ? - Come on across the street , hon . - Okay , baby . Showtime . Come on . Come on , honey . Ow ! What 's she doing ? I think she 's gon na have a baby . My baby . ! My baby . ! Come on . Come on , come on . Well , go . Go , go , go ! Okay , Sam . He 's gone . Ow , ow , ow . ! What now ? What now ? Get out of here . Go down the alley , turn around the corner , go north . Vernon 's house is about a mile out of town . Hurry up ! I 'm okay . I 'll be okay . Do you think he got away ? How the hell should I know ? I did n't hear any gunshots . Hurry up . Sam , hurry up ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Hurry up . It 's not far . It 's just another hundred yards or so . You can almost see it right down the road . Come on . I 'm out of shape , Al . Next leap , maybe you 'll leap into Carl Lewis . Right now you got ta suck it up . Now come on . You gon na make it ? I do n't have much left . How far-Churchdale Road . I remember this place . My-My folks ' farm-It 's just , uh , 10 miles down that road . Well , nobody could blame ya if you kept going . What about Neil and John ? What about all the other families Vernon 's taken advantage of ? You think they 'd understand ? Well , I- I did n't say it 'd be easy . Need a lift , fella ? No thanks . Sam , look out for that- that , uh , pile of newspapers . Wow . Looks like the housekeeper took the year off here . Yeah . Vernon probably repossessed her cleaning equipment or something . Did you know this Vernon when you were here before ? Uh , well , he was a couple years ahead of my brother in high school . He ran for class president , I think . Did he win ? Uh , no . As I remember , he was disqualified . Something about stuffing the ballot box or something . Oh , he was stuffing the ballot box . Well , at least he 's consistent . What are we looking for ? Someplace you would hide valuables , you know ? A - A safe . A wall safe . A filing cabinet or some drawers-A strongbox with a lock the size of Maine ? Okay , uh - A letter opener or a file or something . How about the key ? I 'll , uh , take the gun , please . Careful . I guess that makes it a little easier to sleep at night . I saw an opportunity , so I took it . What a nozzle ! I 'd like to grab his Adam 's apple and pull it out through his nostrils . Most of the farms were so far under , they could n't see the light of day . So you put them out of their misery ? Nobody forced anyone to do anything he did n't want to do . You intimidated them , and then you stole their lives out from under them , all so you could turn a profit . Yeah ? Well , you ca n't prove that , can you ? No , I ca n't . But I 'll bet there 's plenty of proof in here . You 're crazy . I 'm gon na call Chief Mundy and tell him ... that I just killed me an intruder . I was wrong . You have changed . What are you doing ? Sam , what are you doing ? Go ahead , shoot me in the back . It 's more your style , is n't it ? No . I would n't do that , Sam . It 's not a good idea . You know , you made a big mistake coming back home . You should 've stayed away . That makes two of us . Ow ! What , what , what ? What is it ? What is it ? A letter of intent from the developer . Ah , bingo ! All you have to do now is get that back to Mundy , so we can get this over with . Right . I 'm all for that . You did n't see anything else ? All I remember is turning around and seeing Carl Wilkens . What 's that ? Who 's that there ? Willie . Willie ? You keep Mary here . Hold it right there , Willie . Drop the gun . Right now . Chief , this is n't necessary . Humor me . Look , I have evidence that Gus Vernon manipulated , intentionally , the farm loans in order to sell off the land . Is he ? Oh , no . He 's just resting . I want you to look at this . What is it ? It 's an agreement between Gus Vernon and a private developer to build on the foreclosed land . And it was signed six months before the first farm went under . Where 'd you get this ? Vernon 's house . Looks like you 've got enough here to put Gus away for a long while . That 's great . Let me tell my brothers . We can end this . We 've got a bigger problem now . Sam , no , it 's John . He 's been shot . He 's hurt bad . You better get in there quick . Sheriff , I 've got to go talk to my brother . We 've been tryin ' to , but they do n't answer . - The state boys are gettin'ready to go in . - You 've got to get in there . Hurry up ! If you let me talk to them , I can get them to come out . I do n't know . You said yourself that might be enough evidence to convict Vernon . Now let me go tell Neil . He does n't want to hurt anybody . Please , Chief ? Please . What do you got to lose ? All right . Five minutes , or they 'll start moving in . Go ! Go ! You . You killed him . This is all your fault . He was n't gon na hurt anybody . Do n't shoot . It 's just-It 's just me . Willie . Yeah . I did n't think you were coming back . I really messed up this time , did n't I ? It 's okay . We 're gon na take care of everything , all right ? He 's alive . - We have to get him to the hospital . - I did n't mean for this to happen . He came out of nowhere . I thought he was gon na kill John . John . Oh , my God . What did I do ? - Neil , this has got ta end . - Well , what about Vernon ? We ca n't let him get away ! He 's not gon na get away . I got the proof that we needed to get the loan reviewed . You 're gon na get the farm back , but there are people waiting for us to come out first . You did it , did n't you ? You saved us again . L - I never could be what he wanted . I never could be you . Neil , it 's all right . I tried to do the right things . I never wanted to be head of the family . I 've ruined ... everything he built . You did your best . How ? By losing a farm ? No . By being there when he needed you . Do n't you see ? In the end , it was n't my face he saw . It was yours . And no matter what happens to me , no matter what I do for the rest of my life , I can never change that . That moment belongs to you . I loved that old man . I should 've told him . You just did . Now come on . Let 's get him out of here . Is he gon na be okay ? Oh , sure . Yeah , he and Wilkens are both gon na be just fine . The state banking commission reviews the loans that he made , and then they rescind the foreclosure proceedings . What about the brothers ? John and Willie are convicted of illegal entry , but thejudge takes things into consideration , and he lets them off with probation . Uh , Neil is convicted ... of aggravated assault , so he serves a term of five years . Then after he 's released , he just drifts around the country doing odd jobs ... until , uh- " Until , uh , " what ? Until he's-he 's shot in an alley in New Orleans in ' 77 . It 's a robbery , and he gets killed . Are you saying that I leaped in here and saved his life just so he could be murdered ? Well , Sam , they - they ca n't all be happy endings . And there 's nothing I can do ? Well , if you want to hang around here for another six years-I wish I never would have stopped . It-It 's just supposed to be . I just wish this whole thing never would-Okay , John . Dad . Sam . Sam . ! Dad ? Dad , wait a minute . Wai-You 're real . You 're alive , and you 're real . Well , I believe that 's true . Uh , do I know you ? Know me ? Of course , you know me . I 'm your so- No , no , Sam . ! No , he ca n't see you . All he can see is Willie . I 'm Willie Walters . Bill Walters 's boy ? That 's right . I have n't seen you since the funeral . Your father was a good man . He was the best . How 's your mother ? She 's good . She wanted me to give you a message though . Message ? Yeah , she , uh- she wanted me to wish you a merry Christmas . Well , Merry Christmas to you too , son . ! Dad , you 're home ! Well , it 's about time . Arriving passenger Martin Elroy , please report to the courtesy desk . - Martin Elroy . - What 's that about ? What 's what about ? They just paged you . Oh . Well , I guess I was so excited to see everybody , I did n't hear . Well , we 'll get your bags and meet you at the curb . But do n't take too long . I 've got a pot roast in the oven and something special for dessert . Come on . Welcome , Daddy . Hi . Just a moment , please . You , uh - Huh ? Kids ? It 's my turn . Here he is now ! Oh , Daddy ! Oh , I missed you , Daddy . Surprise . ! I missed you , Daddy . Oh , boy .

I meant the butterfly . I suppose you , too , are beautiful , in your own unusual way . Last picnic I let you talk me into . - Apple ? - Thank you . I shall avoid the Garden of Eden parallel Beast would surely make . XAVIER : Eve 's apple was said to contain knowledge . I have always resisted the idea that knowledge ruined Paradise . - What is that ? - XAVIER : I have no idea ! You think we could just attract ants like normal people ! BEAST : Get down ! What gives ? Perhaps next time you will listen . What are you doing here , McCoy ? Milk and cookies run out at the officer 's tent ? BEAST : Bad news . The humans have sent in another wave of land crabs .  BEAST : Look ! They have the leader surrounded . - Come on ! - Wait , Logan ! We can not hope to stop them alone ! No choice , darling . We got to help the leader . We lose Magneto , we lose the war ! WOLVERINE : Hold on , General ! The cavalry 's here ! Advance ! Push them back into the river . Whirlwind , arise !  STORM : Logan ! Get clear !     - An opening , sir ! - MAGNETO : Good work , McCoy ! Forward ! Hang on , my friend . WOLVERINE : Storm !  Come on , Storm ! Oh . You know it , darling .  The army has sent in another wave of superhumans .  Nurse ! Where can I find Dr . Summers ?  - BISHOP : LeBeau ! - Hang on ! I will be fine , Logan . Just get us clear . You got it . WOLVERINE : What the heck is that ? BISHOP : We 're too late ! While we were traveling , Fitzroy and Nimrod already nailed Xavier and changed everything . In this world , there are n't X-Men to help us . Then we go back to 1959 and stop the assassination . But now we go alone . Talk ! Now ! While you can breathe . STORM : You had better do it ! BISHOP : Storm ! He has a short fuse . Then there are still X-Men . How do you know our names , roadkill ? And what are X-Men ? SHARD : They are our heritage . You are . How did we get here ? Behind your lines ? How do we know you ? Why would we risk our lives to talk to you ? I do not know . It is all too difficult to believe .  Look at this world . How are you gon na save us ? With your help , we 're gon na save the life of Charles Xavier . Who is Charles Xavier ? This is the mutant we must protect . Professor Charles Xavier used his powers to bring mutants and non-mutants together . He established a school here , where he and his team of X-Men lived and fought for basic human rights . Until somebody from our time went back and took him out . SHARD : Xavier took his message to people around the world . And when anti-mutant groups sprang up , he put his life on the line . Wolverine , you and Storm worked with him . - That ai n't hard to imagine . - STORM : I ca n't believe it . All of this destruction , all of this misery , is due to the absence of one man ? One of the most important men in history . I do n't buy it ! This is nuts ! BISHOP : Everything here , this war , all that you know , was caused by a time traveler from our future ! We have to go back , rescue Xavier , and keep this from happening . - WOLVERINE : It 's a trick ! - Back off ! The new Wolverine is as dense as the old one . I believe them , Logan . - Lf it will end this perpetual war . - Everything else with it ? You saw the tapes . If we find a way to save this Xavier clown , we 'll end up working together , but not being together . Sorry , pal , but you 're right about that . I 'm ready to go . Are you with us ? - Yeah . You know I am . - Thanks . SHARD : This is our future , before Fitzroy changed it . We were at war , but with the resistance we had hope . STORM : Tell us what we must do . SHARD : Stop the mutant traitor , Fitzroy . This surveillance tape first alerted us to his mission . So , do we have a deal ? If we could time travel without you , mutant , we would . But I do not trust you , Fitzroy , so Nimrod will join your trip across time to make sure you perform the task and return . - Bantam does n't like this ! - Be quiet , you fool ! MAS TERMOLD : Rid me of this meddling professor , and his legacy , mutant resistance , will cease to exist . Document your trip , for if successful , I may not know you . Well said . You know what I require . MAS TERMOLD : Lobdell , I have a job for you . FITZRO Y : He 'll be fine in a few days . MAS TERMOLD : Whatever . Gently , master , I bruise easily ... SHARD : That and their destination were all we got before they found the camera . They went to a small college in New England , May 11 th , 1959 , 9:00 p.m . We 've got to be there when they arrive . We must touch base in our time first , before the portal can send us further back . We must hurry . If the time change has already hit 2055 , all of our efforts will be for nothing . - Ready , Logan ? - Let 's go . BISHOP : Now ! JOHN : Charles , I think you 're taking too narrow a view of this . Professor Gray , I just ca n't see the world populated by human mutants .  Yes , but evolution just is n't that quirky . We change gradually for a purpose . Besides , Cindy 's your future researcher . I just want to be a simple family doctor . Well , I ca n't disagree with your motives . Take care , Charles . I 'll see you in class tomorrow . BISHOP : You are wrong , Charles . Single-generation mutations are possible . - We are both living proof of it . - Who are you ? And how do you know about me ? I read a paper you wrote on the subject in 1978 . - You see , time travel is also possible . - You 're crazy ! And who are you ? Sorry , Xavier , no time for chit-chat . The future depends on us keeping you alive . Alive ? SHARD : So these were the hippie days . BISHOP : Beatnik days , Shard . Hippies came later , man . Nevertheless , it is true . WOLVERINE : I 'll take those . Hmm . Real coffee . It 's been a while . SHARD : I 've been told you can read our thoughts . Search Bishop 's mind . You will see the truth of what we are saying . I do not like to use my powers . But if you insist ... I do n't know how I came to be a mutant . I would not have chosen to be one . And I ca n't imagine being the leader of anything . I want to be a doctor . Still , if what you say is true , it would appear that I am destined to help humanity . They 're doing what ? That does it ! All right , wise guy , you and your freako comrades can just hit the road ! I do n't understand . Skin color prejudice ? That 's so pathetic , it 's almost quaint . - It ai n't quaint . - Who are you calling pathetic ? You mongrels must be some kind of medical experiment . I think you just insulted the woman I love , lowlife . You okay , Professor ? Yes , and please , stop calling me that . Now , you can either apologize or I 'm gon na show you how intolerant I can be . - Are n't you going to stop him ? - Logan , do not hurt him ! You should thank the lady . She just saved your useless life .   - Sorry about the ruckus . - Did you have to do that ? Forget about that ! We 're talking about the future of the world . If you do n't let us help you , in a couple of hours you 'll be dead and everything we know will be gone . I just do n't know . It 's all so unreal . Get them ! - Keep them away from Xavier ! - My pleasure .   It 's all so unreal . We are not here to hurt you . Bad listening . Let 's go ! - I ai n't done yet ! - Yes , you are , Logan . Hurry , before you make things worse ! Professor ? He 's gone ! Spread out . We 've got to find him before Fitzroy does ! You did it again , Logan . You lost your temper and the man you were supposed to protect . I 'm sorry , darling . Thinking about losing you has made me a little edgy . I know . Let 's go find Xavier . Xavier ? Are you all right ? - Oh , yes . - Gotcha ! - Nimrod ! - So , this is Nimrod .    No tin can man is gon na get the best of me ! Crack the heavens ! Remove this abomination ! - Fitzroy . Bantam , come on ! BANTAM : I hate this ...  Soulless monster ! XAVIER : Such power and destruction ! I 'm ... I 'm not capable of mastering anything like that ! I ca n't !  Electronic fuse ! What in the world ?  No ! Something was very wrong with Gambit . I felt a deep sense of dread that I have never felt in him before . Never knew old Gambit cared so much about his family . Ha ! Heck , did n't even know he had one . I hear you need help tracking a Cajun ? Well , well , looks like he got his licks in before he left . Can it , wild boy , if you do n't want a little of the same . Gambit 's gone off alone against who knows what .

It seems the show is so scary , Congress wo n't even let us show it . Instead they 've suggested the 1947 classic Glenn Ford movie Two Hundred Miles to Oregon . There 's nothing wrong with your television set . Do not attempt to adjust your picture . We are controlling the transmission . What 's that , boy ? We 're in control ? Hey , look ! I can see my voice ! This is my voice on TV - Dad , you 're ruining the mood ! - Sorry . For the next half-hour , we will control what you see and hear . You are about to experience the terror and foul horror of The Simpsons Halloween Special . Well , it was a long trip , but we 're almost there . When you locked the front door , did you remember to lock the back door ? Oh , no ! We left Grampa back at the gas station ! What about Grampa ? - Hello ! - Hi ! - We 're here ! - Oh , goody . The sea monkeys I ordered have arrived . Look at them cavort and caper . Sir , they 're the new winter caretakers for the lodge . Yes , they work hard and they play hard . This house has quite a long and colorful history . It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground and was the setting of Satanic rituals , witch burnings and five John Denver Christmas specials . John Denver . That 's odd . Usually the blood gets off at the second floor . Hey , I found a shortcut through your hedge maze . Why , you little ... No , no . Go easy on the wee one . His father 's gon na go crazy and chop them all into haggis . - You mean shining . - You want to get sued ? Now , look , boy , if your da goes gaga you just use that shin of yours to call me and I 'll come a-running . But do n't be reading my mind between 4 and 5 . That 's Willie 's time ! Yes , by cutting off cable TV and the beer supply I can ensure an honest winter 's work out of those lowlifes . Sir , did you ever stop to think that maybe it was doing this that caused the previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families ? Perhaps . Tell you what , we come back and everyone 's slaughtered I owe you a Coke . Cable 's out . Think I 'll have a beer . Not a drop in the house . What do you know . Homer , I 'm impressed . You 're taking this quite well . I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill all of you ! - Homer ! - Sorry . Sorry . Do n't worry . See you later . Mom , is Dad gon na kill us ? We 're just gon na have to wait and see . - So , what 'll it be , Homer ? - Moe , give me a beer ! No . Not unless you kill your family . Why should I kill my family ? They 'd be much happier as ghosts . - You do n't look so happy . - Oh , I 'm happy . I 'm very happy . See ? Now waste your family , I 'll give you a beer . Homer ? Homie ? What he 's typed will be a window into his madness . " Feeling fine . " Wow , that 's a relief . This is less encouraging . Well , what do you think , Marge ? All I need is a title . I was thinking along the lines of No TV and No Beer Make Homer something , something . Go Crazy ? Do n't mind if I do ! Give me the bat ! Come on . Give me the bat . Give me the bat ... Scaredy cat . You stay here till you 're no longer insane . Chili would be good tonight . Homer , it 's Moe . Look , some of the ghouls and I are a little concerned the project is n't moving forward . - Ca n't murder now . Eating . - For crying out loud . Come on . - No ! Here 's Johnny ! David Letterman ! Hi , David . I 'm Grampa . I 'm Mike Wallace . I 'm Morley Safer . And I 'm Ed Bradley . All this and Andy Rooney tonight on 60 Minutes ! Hello , police , this is Marge Simpson . My husband is on a murderous rampage . Over . Well , thank God that 's over . I was worried there for a second . - No answer . - Do n't worry , Mom . I can use my shinning to call Willie . I 'm coming to rescue the lot of you ! All right , loony , show me what you got . Is that the best you can do ? Oh , my . I hope that rug was Scotchgarded . Must kill family . - Had been given rifles , but no ammunition . - Fortunately , there was a hardware store . - Dad , look ! Television ! Teacher ! Mother ! Secret lover . Urge to kill fading . Fading . Fading . Rising ! Fading . Fading . Gone . Come , family . Sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television 's warm , glowing , warming glow . Live from Broadway , it 's The Tony Awards . With your hosts , Tyne Daly and Hal Linden . - Homer , change channel . - Ca n't . Frozen . Urge to kill rising . You know , Marge , I 've had my share of troubles . Dad , your hand is jammed in the toaster ! What ? Get it off ! Get it off ! Get it off of me ! Dad , it 's in there again ! No ! It 's stuck on my hand . This should n't be too hard to fix , with the right tools . There . Better than new . Now , to take her for a test toast . What the ... ? Look at that . I 'm the first non-Brazilian person to travel backwards through time . Correction , Homer . You 're the second . - That 's right , Mr . Peabody . - Quiet , you . I 've gone back to the time when dinosaurs were n't just confined to zoos . Okay , do n't panic . Remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day . If you ever travel back in time , do n't step on anything . Because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you ca n't imagine . Fine . Stupid bug ! You go squish now ! That was just one little insignificant mosquito . That ca n't change the future , right ? Right ? I 'm back . My loving family . Nothing 's changed . Hidilly-ho , slave-a-reenos . Okilly-dokilly . Hey , what the hell is that geek Flanders doing on TV ? I see by the big board we got a Negative Nelly in sector two . I 'm gon na have to ask the whole family to kind of freeze and prepare for re-Neducation . Do n't you remember , Dad ? Flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world . Okay , everybody . Let 's see some big smiles . Just relax . Let the hooks do their work . What the hell are you smiling at ? Now , in case all that smiling did n't cheer you up there 's one thing that never fails : A nice glass of warm milk , a little nap , and a total frontal lobotomy . Look . Hello . Hello there . Who 's that big man there ? Who 's that ? - Join us , Father . - Join us , Father . It 's bliss . No ! Oh , no . They 're gaining on me . Wait ! I have an idea ! These wieners will give me the quick energy I need to escape ! I got ta go back , fix future . This time I 'm not gon na touch a thing . Must n't crush . Must n't kill . Made it . I wish , I wish I had n't killed that fish Hey , where is everybody ? Hey , there 's a bug that looks like Dad . - Let 's kill it . - Okay . This is gon na cost me . I mean , hey . Good morning , Father , dear . Hope you 're well . You 're still not in your own world , Homer . I can get you home , but you have to do exactly as I ... This is indeed a disturbing universe . Do n't touch anything ? I 'll touch whatever I feel like ! Foolish earthling , totally unprepared for the effects of time travel . - What happened to us , Kodos ? - Quiet , you . - Good morning . - What 's my name ? What color is the sky ? What of doughnuts ? What ? For the love of God , tell me ! Homer , the sky is blue , doughnuts are plentiful , Friday is TGIF night on ABC . - What 's gotten into you ? - Nothing . Nothing at all . Let 's just eat . Close enough . Hey , everybody ! Let 's all turn our desks backwards before Mrs . Krabappel shows up . - Yeah ! Over here , Simpson . The detention room is overcrowded , so you 'll be serving in the cafeteria . Oxygen running out . You should 've thought of that before you made that paper airplane . This overcrowding in detention is becoming critical . It 's a powder keg waiting to go off in an explosion of bad behavior . Do n't bitch to me , boss man . Thanks to the latest budget cuts , I 'm down to using Grade F meat . It would be wonderful if there was a common solution to both our problems . - That would be great . - Hey , Bart . Watch this . Oh , no ! My favorite outfit ! Jimbo , this is by far the worst ... Jimbo , why do n't you assist Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen ? - Bite me , Skinner . - Well , might we . It 's hard for me to clean this giant pot when you keep spilling meat tenderizer all over me . Oh , great ! Seymour , what 's with the good grub ? Well , perhaps I ought to let you folks in on a secret . You remember me telling Jimbo Jones that I 'd make something of him one day ? Are you saying you killed Jimbo processed his carcass , and served him for lunch ? I wonder where Jimbo is today . He should 've beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago . Frau Lunchlady , please to have another Sloppy Jimbo ? That 's your third helping , young man . It 's making you fat and soft and tender . You just cut in line , did n't you ? - Report to detention , Uter . - For how long ? About seven minutes a pound should do it . Okay , I got your German grub right here . Bart , does it strike you as odd that Uter disappeared and suddenly they 're serving us this mysterious food called " Uterbraten " ? Oh , relax , kids . Wait , scratch that one . Mom ! Mom ! You 've got ta help ! They 're cooking kids in the school cafeteria ! Listen , kids , you 're 8 and 10 years old now . - I ca n't fight all your battles for you . - But , Mom ! No buts . You march right back to that school look them straight in the eye and say , " Do n't eat me . " - Okay . - Okay . Since so many students have been put on permanent detention we 've merged everyone into a single class . I trust there are no objections ? Detention . Hey , you guys , I was just thinking that any one of us could be next . So , what do you say we make a break for it ? Easy there , young man . You 'll only make yourself tired and stringy . I 'll ... I 'm bad at this . I 'm going to enjoy devouring you , Bart Simpson . Yes , I believe I 'll start as you 've so often suggested by eating your shorts . Do n't worry , guys . Something always comes along to save us . Nevertheless , I remain confident that something will come along and save the two Simpson children . Relax , honey . You were just having a crazy nightmare . You 're back with your family now , where there 's nothing to be afraid of except that fog that turns people inside out . It 's seeping in . Stupid , cheap weather stripping ! One chorus line of people Dancing till they make us stop Two ! Many dancing people Covered with blood , gore and glop Just one sniff of that fog And you 're inside out It 's worse than that flesh-eating virus You 've read about Vital organs They are what we 're dressed in The family dog is eyeing Bart 's intestine Happy Halloween Subtitles @ @ @ @ @ 
@@5237241 In the criminal justice system , sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous . In New York City , the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit . These are their stories . Armando , wake up . What ? Shh . Someone 's in the house . Call 911 . I ca n't find the phone . Just get in the closet . Is that you , Itsy ? Who the hell is Itsy ? Who the hell is she ? No ID . Ca n't tell me her name . Ca n't or wo n't ? I think Granny 's only knitting with one needle , if you catch my drift . Well , she came in through a window , so she was pretty desperate to get in . Well , she thinks she lives here , apparently with someone named Itsy . And you canvassed the building ? Yeah . No one knows her . Yeah , Granny Doe made herself right at home . That 's her coat on the rack . Okay . Thanks . It 's okay . Please . Make them leave . All right . I 'm Detective Benson . Can you tell me what happened ? I have to talk to Itsy . Okay . Is Itsy the one that hurt you ? You do n't know anything , do you ? Just what Itsy told me . She promised not to tell . Well , that 's because she wants you to tell me . What happened ? He had his way with me . Who did ? Ma'am , may I ? Did you see that ? Yeah . Someone used her for an ashtray . Was she raped ? No abrasions or fluids , you 'll have to wait for the kit . But she had 12 raw burns to her breasts and genitals . She was in shock when we talked to her . You think she 'll remember more details ? I doubt it . Her head CT and MRI are clear , no sign of infection . She probably has Alzheimer 's . So , no short-term memory . She has n't been admitted yet ? No need to . She has mild high blood pressure . Nothing more serious . I gave her Silvadene lotion for her burns . This woman needs supervised care . Long-term . We do n't provide that here . I just need someone to release her to . Do you feel up to talking now ? Oh , where 's my purse ? Look , what happened to my purse ? You did n't have one with you . Did you take it when you went out ? Well , I had my purse here 10 minutes ago . Of course I had my purse . We 'll help you look for it . Did it have your name in it ? Of course it had my name in it . Okay . What was the name ? I do n't know . Whatever . What could have happened to my purse ? Well , what 's it to you ? You took my purse . You make her give me back my purse . Nobody else could have taken my purse . You give me back my purse . Maybe the person who hurt you took your purse ? Were you attacked in your home ? Or someplace else ? Can you remember ? I was in my bedroom . I was ... I was asleep , and I ... I was asleep in my bedroom and I ... I woke up and ... He pushed up my nightgown . He was in there . Oh , it hurt so bad . I tried to hit him . I tried to push him off , but I could n't move . Did you know your attacker ? Who was it ? It was ... How did he get in the house ? Well , he stays there . He stays there ? Why ? Well , he stays there because he lost all his money investing it . He drinks every night . Whiskey . Oh , he smells so awful when he ... Okay . We can help you . Frightening . When this steel trap starts to rust , call Kevorkian . Consider that done . Have Adult Protective Services pick her up . Where are we on her ID ? We re-canvassed the building and did a sweep of the neighborhood . No one 's claiming her . Well , she said her abuser lives with her . Yeah , so he wo n't be calling Missing Persons . Well , how far could this lady have gone in her nightie ? She broke into that apartment for a reason . She must have lived there at some point . Manager 's been there 20 years . He 's never seen her . That building 's been there at least a hundred . Go back further . The 1930 census was just unsealed this year . I can give you the name , age , sex and race of any person at any address . Assuming they were n't paranoid conspiracy freaks with a wicked big-brother complex . Actually , 72 is the average man 's life span . A woman 's is 79 . Oh , a man who knows his stats . Did you know the 1930 census takes 2,667 rolls of ... Yo , stop , stop , stop . Okay . There 's Seventh . Back up . There 's Sixth and there 's the building , 213 . Yeah . Apartment 1-A . The Staytons . Ellsworth , Hilda and three daughters , Lilith , 11 , Isabel , 10 , and Millie , eight . Today they 'd be 83 , 82 and 80 . She 's got ta be one of these three girls . This is n't Lilith or Isabel ? No , both my sisters passed on . Lily in ' 92 and cancer took Izzy back in ' 78 . You called Isabel " Izzy " ? Everyone did . No one ever called her " Itsy " ? Dear Lord , Itsy and Bitsy . I have n't thought about her in years . Bess Maclntyre . Did Bess ever live with you ? No , no . But sometimes she 'd sneak over in the middle of the night . Poor thing , cry herself to sleep . She would wake up your whole family in the middle of the night ? Oh , no , no , she 'd sneak in through a window . Why was she crying ? I was too young to understand at the time , but Bess had what we used to call a " funny uncle . " Mother never let us play at her house the whole time he lived there . I got it , thanks . I 'm sorry , did I wake you ? Who are you ? I 'm Olivia . Remember ? And I 'm sorry , do you go by Bitsy or Bess now ? Bess . We 've never met . We had a long talk this morning . After the hospital ? I never go to a hospital . I 'm a very healthy person . I was arrested ? No , no , no . You were attacked . You said that it was the man staying with you . The man who lost all his money in the stock market . Were you talking about your uncle ? What year did he lose all his money ? What year did he lose all his money ? He lost his money in 1929 . Everybody did . Bess , that was over 70 years ago . Your uncle hurt you when you were little . Tell me , who is hurting you now ? Well , in the small favors category , her rape kit came back negative . You look at those burns and tell me this skeev did her any favors . Looks like the doc 's done with her . What 'd you get ? The attack definitely triggered memories of her childhood molestation . So she fled to the only safe harbor she could think of , her friend Isabel 's home . So we just solved a 70-year-old rape case . Uncle Ted was arrested in ' 53 on five counts of rape , but not for Bess . He was killed in prison in ' 57 . Well , somebody tortured her again last night and I 'm pretty sure it was n't the dead uncle . So , who are we looking for ? A sadist . He enjoyed the torture , though I 'm not sure if it was sexual or anger-based . He 's young or socially stunted . He chose an enfeebled woman because of feelings of inadequacy . I tracked Bess through Social Security . Her checks are sent care of Jubilee Towers on Madison . Nice place for a nursing home . We 're not a nursing home . We 're an assisted living facility . Hello . Hope Garrett . Hi . Assistant Administrator . How may I help you ? I 'm Detective Benson . This is my partner , Detective Stabler . Let 's see . Uh ... Yes , all our Level One-ers are accounted for . You do bed checks ? The residents are required to flip a switch every morning , just to let us know that they 're still with us . Well , I can guarantee you Bess Sherman did not flip her own switch today . How could she have ? Mrs . Sherman was released about two weeks ago . To whom ? Her son . Joe Sherman . Mr . Sherman ? These folks have a warrant . I 'm letting them in . He 's usually home from work about now . Nice place . No , it 's his mother 's . Rent-controlled . $350 a month , you believe that ? Mr . Sherman smoke ? Only in between the times he quits . How 's Joe been getting along with his mother since she moved back in ? All I know is she sure brought him some luck . Deliveries . What kind of deliveries ? Big-screen TV came in over the weekend . Couch , chairs , the media unit . Got all the bells and whistles , CD , DVD , stereo , video , got a TiVo . Elliot . Really fixed this place up . Except for this room . Bess ' room , I 'm assuming . Looks more like her cell . Check this out . Explains the restraint marks . Joe did n't want to lose his lucky charm . Who are you , and what are you doing here ? Police . Just checking out your mother 's accommodations . Well , where is she ? Is she okay ? She 's safer than she was in this place . Let 's go . I wan na see my mother . When we 're done . Have a cigarette . I do n't smoke . Really ? We heard you did . I quit . Could I see her right now ? As soon as you explain these . It 's for her own protection . Protection ? But you do n't protect her from this . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . Well , you do n't think I burned her ? Actually , we do . Well , then you 're more confused than she is . Obviously some pervert attacked her on the street when she got out . But you did n't notice she was gone . I had an early breakfast meeting . I did n't want to wake her . But you do n't mind leaving her tied up to a bed for 18 hours ? Now , how was she supposed to use the bathroom ? Look , the housekeeper takes care of that . Maria comes in every morning . She makes Mom breakfast . She wakes her up . But she did n't come this morning . No . I do n't know why Maria did n't call me . And believe me , she 's fired . Well , we 'll take care of that for you . They were draining her . She paid those crooks seven grand a month . Leaving nothing for you . All right , you know what ? I 'm done . So you either charge me , or you let me go . And I 'm gon na take my mother with me . No way we 're releasing Bess into his custody . He 's her legal guardian . He 's her abuser . According to whom ? You have no witnesses , and the victim ca n't make a complaint . Look , we suspect a parent of abuse , Child Services does n't need the victim 's complaint . The law assumes a child ca n't speak up for itself . Neither can Bess . And her son is strapping her to a bed . A lawyer could argue he believed it was a reasonable , albeit very misguided , attempt to keep Bess safe . It 's a stretch . Well , then stretch it into an order of removal . We 'll stall Joe . What 's the problem now ? I have a protective order to place your mother back in Jubilee Towers until this matter is straightened out . My mom belongs with me . The courts disagree with you . Mom . Mom , would you tell them that I did not hurt you ? Why is it so noisy in here ? I 'm gon na sue every one of your asses . Lawyers are mighty expensive , Joe . Here 's a protective order freezing your mother 's accounts and assets . You ca n't do that . Mom , do n't you worry , I am gon na bring you home ! Captain , got any tissues for me ? I 'm about to break out into tears . Hey , escort Mr . Sherman out the back . I thought maybe he took her to the doctor . She ran away sometime the night before . Could you come up here , please ? We 'd like to ask you a few questions . Do you have any idea what she was running from ? You ever see any marks or bruises on Mrs . Sherman ? No . Did you ever see Mr . Sherman hurt her ? No , but when things are stressful , he speaks very harsh with her . Was he stressed out Monday ? Very . Everything had to be just perfect for his party . I invited a few investors over . You failed to mention it . It was n't relevant . I can assure you that none of them touched my mother . Delway Furniture Rentals says your Visa was declined . Send them a check . But the bank called ... Just deal with it . I think you mean your mother 's accounts . This is a start-up business , my mother 's a key investor . What about those big investors at your party ? Do n't go near them . Why , they see something you do n't want us to hear about ? Maybe Mom wandered out , caused a scene , embarrassed you ? So you drove home the burning importance of being a silent partner . Why are you trying to destroy me when the monster who tortured my mother is still out there ? Joe , just cough up the party list . No way in hell you 're ever gon na get that list . Damn it to hell , you got crap all over my shoes . If you wan na bitch , switch places . This one 's full of rancid salmon puffs . Maybe they did n't go over too big at Joe 's party . You sure it 's Joe 's ? Incoming . Housekeeper said she threw out three bags with yellow ties . Hair dye for men . And something that 's best applied anally . Stop jerking around and find the guest book . Hello ! Names ? Cigarette butts . One of them 's got ta be our weapon . You 're keeping me busy , Detectives . Forty-five cigarette butts in all . Five different brands . Any way to match the butts to the wounds ? If we were talking about cigars or slims . Unfortunately , most brands are identical in size , so there 's no way to narrow down by wound diameter . Just need to prove that the attack took place in that apartment . Any way to find flesh residue ? Well , at the point of inhalation , the burn zone temperature is around 850 and 900 degrees . Seared away all the evidence . DNA from saliva on the filters will take weeks to run . We 're screwed . Not really . Fingerprints . Ninhydrin . I 'll spray them all and then I 'll run them through the system . Investing in one of these is like buying a Monet . It 's easy on the eyes as it gains in value . Will you excuse me , please ? Hi , there ! Hugh Wilkins ? How can I help you ? By fessing up . The Tychon Food Chopper , it could n't really slice and dice a beer can , now , could it ? Sure it could . Of course , you have to follow the instructional video , sold separately . How did you ... When you got bonded to sell that crap door-to-door , you gave up your prints . We found one on a cigarette butt you left at Joe Sherman 's party . Did you have any trouble with his moms that night ? His mother ? I never even saw her . What 's this about ? Joe . Yeah . What 's his racket ? Oh ! The Trifecta Wizard . It 's an unbeatable horseracing software program . You should ask Joe about his llama ranch in Texas . That one even scared off his mother . She was an investor ? Up until two years ago , she was his principal backer . After that , she had to guard what was left of the nest egg . She cut the purse strings . That must have pissed Joe off . Well , he went broke . But then the old lady moves back in , lo and behold , he has start-up money again . According to everyone we spoke to , Joe has been a leech his entire life . Right behind you , speak of the devil . Look , I asked you to stay away from my investors . Three just pulled out . And we 're only through half the list . You 're ruining me . Like you were ruining your mother ? We pulled her financials , Joe . The only money I ever took from her was rent . Five times a month ? All made to cash . Let me see those . And was Andy at the party ? He stopped by , uninvited , with one of his deadbeat friends . He needed a place to sober up . They spend the night ? No . I gave him just an hour . Told him to stay in the den , out of sight . Where does your son live ? Jersey . With his mom . Now will you leave my investors alone ? What the hell ? Who let you in ? Your mother . We heard you were on the party circuit . What ? Dad 's ? Monday night ? I do n't call being exiled to the broom closet a party . We also heard that your dad was n't too proud of his dropout son . Dropout ? Is that what he said ? What do you say ? My gran set me up with a college trust fund . I had to drop out when Dad drained it . All he left me with is a ratty old Ilama-hair coat . I 'm not pissed at Gran . It 's my dad who 's a jerk . I 'm the only one who ever visited her at the home . You see her at the party ? Of course I did . She write you out any more checks ? Sometimes she gives me presents . She does n't even know her own name . Must take some prodding on your part . She 's the only person in my life who ever gave a crap about me . I would never , ever hurt her . What about that guy that you hang out with ? Hal ? Yeah . Does he smoke ? Yeah . Was he ever alone with your gran at the party ? I do n't know . You do n't know . I might have nodded off a bit . Mmm-hmm . Where can we find this Hal ? At work . Jubilee Towers , where my gran was . That 's where we met . He took care of her . Leave me alone ! Stop it ! Leonard ! Idiot ! Look what you did ! Hey , Hal , calm down . Who are you ? We 're the police . Sir , are you okay ? He 's trying to kill me . What do you want ? Are you always this good with the patients ? Help me , do n't let him take me away . Do n't you worry , nobody 's taking anybody anywhere . Oh , please , do n't encourage him . This happens every day . Mr . Leonard hates needles . But he is going to chemo . We need to talk . In private . Look , I 've got three patients late for appointments and I 've had nothing but troublemakers all day . Troublemakers ? How about Bess Sherman ? She one of your troublemakers ? No , she 's a dream . We heard you ran into her on the outside . With the end of a cigarette butt . Maybe that rings a bell . Even we non-medical employees are trained in CPR . Well , have the safety standards been slipping since Hal started working here ? Are all of those complaints ? You have to understand that many patients will complain if you just look at them wrong . Hal 's worked here a year . He 's only had one serious complaint against him . Which was what ? Well , Mr . Jackson accused Hal of trying to suffocate him . Well , did you call the police ? Uh ... Mr . Jackson is senile . Well , did you at least check on it ? Of course I did , but we found nothing . You have to realize that fiction and reality blend in the mind of some of our patients . You know , we get rape reports after the enema cart makes its rounds . Hal did n't strike me as a real people person . Now , why hire someone like that ? It 's a very low-paying job . Not a lot of people find changing adult diapers rewarding ... Whoa , whoa . Hal injured patients ? No , patients injured him . Mr . Jackson ? Yeah ? You the nude models I ordered ? No . Actually we 're ... That was a joke . What can I do you for ? Heard you had problems with Hal , the nurse 's aide . That man 's a serial killer . Tell us about it . He pinches me all the time . One day I bit him , real hard . Son of a bitch cut off my oxygen , whispered , " You 're gon na die soon , old man . " And nobody did anything about it ? Hell , no . Took his word over mine . Well , we believe you . He done anything since then ? Sheet people scared him off . Who ? You know who I mean . Klan comes at night , roams the halls . Better watch your back . Okay . We had Mr . Jackson till he took a left at Mississippi . Okay . Well , we heard you scratched his face . Why ? I ca n't say for sure . Oh , you know , just tell them . It was after I broke my hip last fall . Yeah , taking dancing lessons for that cruise . Anyway , when I came back after surgery , I woke up one night , convinced that someone was suffocating me . Was it Hal ? Well , it sure was n't the morphine . All I know is that I thought I was dying . I started clawing at something . Then , suddenly , I could breathe again . When I opened my eyes , Hal was standing over me , his face scratched and bleeding . What 'd he say ? That I was hallucinating . He pinches the patients , hides their dentures , and when he wants a real rush , he plays keep-away with their oxygen . But here 's the rub . Every victim was either doped up or senile . Making them the perfect victims . That 's probably why he took the job in the first place . He gets his rocks off watching them suffer . What do you got ? A notice of claim filed six months ago against Jubilee Towers . A $10 million negligence suit brought about by the estate of a deceased former resident . What happened ? Does n't say . A settlement was reached with a nondisclosure clause . Who was named in the suit ? Everyone the dead woman came into contact with , from the director down to the lowliest of nurse 's aides . Including our pal Hal ? This dead woman have a name ? Dahlia Brown . I 'm already working on an exhumation order . Not bad for nine months in the ground . Skin 's perfectly intact . She 's lost some muscle tone , but have n't we all ? You know the day 's coming when embalming fluid is put in a lotion . Until then that time , it will remain the medical examiner 's worst nightmare . Anything you could test for ? Tissue toxicology , heavy metals , which came back negative for arsenic , lead and cyanide . The death certificate said cardiac arrest . Which means we do n't know what really happened , but we do n't think it was foul play . The M.E . 's got ta put something down for cause of death . What would you have put ? I do n't know , but I certainly would have mentioned this . A tiny pinprick hole unaccounted for in the medical records . She was in the hospital wing . Maybe they gave her an IV . She was in to have her knee drained . The hole 's in the wrong place . You settled with the deceased 's daughter . Realize you made a mistake ? No , it was cheaper than going to court . Well , then what happened with Dahlia ? Well , grieving people sometimes have trouble accepting the death of loved ones . The pain makes them look for someone to blame .S . Any other nurses ' aides with those initials besides Hal Shipley ? We 're gon na need to speak with anybody who might have seen him with Dahlia that night . Okay . Man , I do n't want to grow old . In our line of work , be careful what you wish for . How 'd you do ? No one remembers any fireworks between them , but I did find out a little about Dahlia . Great lady , lousy patient ? When she was in pain , she was a pain . Needy and demanding , Hal 's favorite . Yeah , he had means , he had opportunity with Bess , Dahlia , Mr . Jackson , a dozen others . That we know of . He 's like a psycho kid in a candy store . Time to take away his candy . Excuse me , where ... Room 410 's coding . Quick , get the crash cart . 410 is Bess ' room . Hope . You were right . I saw it was him . He was ... Let 's calm down . Just take a breath and tell us what happened . After we talked , I called Hal in and , you know , I told him to finish his shift and leave . He wanted to know why , and I told him . I said , " It 's because of the way you treat the patients . " And he was furious and he just stormed out . You ca n't help in there . Now , did he make any threats ? No , but after what we talked about , you know ... I was worried , so I came down to check on Bess , and that 's when I saw him . What was he doing ? He was just ... He was leaving the room , but I did n't even think . I just went in there and her pulse was weak and thready and I just pushed the code button and started CPR . I 'm gon na go with her . Put her on a monitor and start an IV . She had a fresh needle mark . What are you still doing here ? We heard you were fired . The pencil-pushing bootlicker told me to finish off my shift . Account for your whereabouts for the last 15 minutes . Stockroom . Taking inventory . Let 's go for a ride , Hal . Am I under arrest ? No . Then screw off . Excuse me ? Whatever . Let 's party . I hope I 'm not interrupting anything . Yeah , a big tearful goodbye . Oh , you really do n't wan na miss this . You got a latent print report ? Hal 's known , identified print . From that last cig break at the Towers . You really should n't litter . You ca n't do that . Yeah , well , you voluntarily discarded it . Meaning legally , your butt is ours . As is this one , retrieved from Joe Sherman 's party trash . Lots of guys were smoking at the party . Yeah ? Well , how many had seared flesh at the end of their cancer sticks ? That we can match to Bess Sherman . Uh ... Where 's the lab on the DNA ? I 'm on my way there right now . Call us when you know . When we have the results , we wo n't need a confession from pantywaist here . No confession , no plea bargain . Which means you do the max . CSU said they could n't get flesh off of the cigarette . Oops . Okay , I burned her . What ? I burned her . Why ? It 's not like I planned it . Andy owed me a lot of money , which he said he could get from Grandma Bess . Owed you money for what ? Nothing to do with this . He pulls a check from her purse , says , " You need to sign this , Gran . " Bam , she does . So you go back in , get another check . And she yells , " Rape . " Just like she used to at the home when I 'd help dress her . As if . Your job sucked , we know . No , you do n't know ! I had to clean them and feed them and wipe up their crap . They owed you . So all she had to do was sign the other check . But what does she do ? She screams ? She tried to get you in trouble . So I go over to quiet her down , and my cigarette accidentally burns her chest . And she starts screaming rape at the top of her lungs , and I just ... I just snap . I say , " I 'll show you rape . " And I pull up her nightgown and I jab that cigarette at her again and again and again . What happened when you saw her today ? I did n't see her today . When she coded , I was in the stockroom . I can prove it . Hal 's been hacking into the drug computer . Son of a bitch was stealing drugs . Maybe he fudged the times . According to the tech , this machine is like the Fort Knox of drug dispensers . Then he 's covered . His list of stolen nurses ' codes matches perfectly to what we found in his locker . Well , Hope swore she saw him leaving Bess ' room . So , if the computer 's not lying ... Bess is n't the first patient Hope has saved , you know . Really ? She found Mrs . Mercer in cardiac arrest last Christmas Eve . Same situation ? She started CPR ? Can you imagine a more depressing day to die ? Sounds like a Christmas miracle . I think there was one other time . Zona ? Yeah ? Did n't Hope Garrett save another patient before ? Oh . She tried . The guy did n't make it . No , this was a woman . Their anti-youth counterstatement . You know , the punch always gets spiked , somebody tries to limbo and breaks a hip . So this woman that Hope saved was otherwise a healthy dance casualty . Well , she was n't dancing . She collapsed at the buffet table . It 's a good thing Hope knows her CPR . I 'm not gon na let anybody else hurt you , Ma . You 're coming home with me . You sure that 's in her best interest ? Oh , I do n't know , maybe I 'll throw her back in with that lunatic who burned her , like you did . Dad , you 're upsetting Gran . No lip from you . You 're the one that started this whole thing by letting that drug supplier into my house . I 'll come by later , Gran . I 'll bring those brochures of the other homes . Sweet boy . Oh , you 're so quick . It only took two attempts on my mother 's life for you to figure it out . You 're my friend , are n't you ? Yes , I am , Bess . Make this man be quiet . Do n't you worry about it . He 's just leaving . Guess again . I was wrongly accused . The protective order was dropped . Well , I hear that the misappropriation of funds investigation is just beginning . Uh , I 'm sorry , is this a bad time ? No , you 're welcome anytime . And thanks for saving my mother 's life . Oh , well , Bess is one of our favorites . No way she 's going anywhere while I 'm around . So , you have saved , what , three now ? Including Bess , yeah , I guess so . And just that one loss . Mr . Tazelo . But he was alone long enough to die unnoticed . Or was he still breathing when you found him ? He was . I mean , you know , he was dead . But you still tried to resuscitate him . Well , I did n't know how long he 'd been there . We bring people back all the time . So , I just , um , you know , pulled him to the floor and started CPR . I did n't want to give up . They had to pull me off . This woman is a complete wacko . It could be malignant hero syndrome . A person sets up a risky situation to create an emergency and then comes out a hero . Like a fireman starting a fire . It 's all about personal gain . In this case , attention , prestige . Like Munchausen by proxy . She kills people just to bring them back to feel better about herself . She had epinephrine in her system . That 's what they give when your heart stops , right ? Exactly . I guess that 's why it 's under the " no big surprise " column . Well , Hope revived Bess with CPR . Once her heart was started again , she should n't have been given epinephrine . And according to this chart , she was n't . What would happen if that was given to somebody who had a healthy heart ? It would speed up heart rate , increasing cardiac output and blood pressure to a dangerous level . Mimicking a heart attack . Perfect crime . Son of a bitch . Hope was a nurse . She worked at Oak Glade Nursing Home . Her license was revoked 15 years ago . On what grounds ? Gross negligence . " Failed to dilute potassium chloride doses . " It 's cozy , is n't it ? An elevator adjacent . Do you like to swim , Mr . It 's a hell of a lot safer than being injected with epinephrine . Is everything all right ? Absolutely . Excuse me one minute . Elliot , Olivia . Um ... This probably is n't a good time to talk about the unpleasantness . Oh , we do n't plan to discuss it here . Good . A squad room would be much more appropriate . Did something new happen with Hal ? Well , our techs pulled the used syringes on the Sharps boxes here . Hal 's prints were n't on any of them . Well , he had access to , you know , over a dozen boxes of surgical gloves , so maybe he thought to use a pair . You did n't . They found your prints on a syringe of epi in the box at the nurses ' station . Well , you know Hal did it . He confessed . To burning her . But you did n't give a damn about that as long as you could grab the spotlight . Hope Garrett , you 're under arrest for the attempted murder of Bess Sherman ... What are you talking about ? ... and suspicion of murders committed at Oak Glade Nursing Home . This is ridiculous , okay ? You have the right to remain silent . This is absolutely ridiculous . It 's a mistake . If you give up that right , anything you say ... This is a mistake ! I examined the records of 22 deaths at Oak Glade between May of 1982 and March of 1987 . And what did you find ? Evidence of potassium poisoning in seven of them . Why was n't this discovered in any of their autopsies ? People expect the elderly to die . An autopsy is performed maybe one out of 25 cases . Well , surely some of them were examined ? Yes , but when cells die , they release potassium . It would have been impossible to detect . So , how did you ? By examining their EKGs . Uh ... In layman 's terms ? Their hearts were beating too fast . Dr . Warner , what causes there to be too much potassium in the blood ? Kidney failure can , or it was introduced by an outside source . Did any of them have kidney disease ? No . Someone administered lethal doses . Do you have any idea how many mistakes doctors make , how many times I 've covered their asses ? Counselor , you control your client , or I 'll have her removed from this courtroom . Yes , Your Honor . The jury will disregard the defendant 's outburst . The People may proceed . One last question , Dr . Warner . In all these cases , how many different administering nurses were there ? Just one . Hope Garrett . Yes , but you have to understand every last one of them was at death 's door . Counselor . Your Honor , I 'm sorry . This wo n't happen again . You had no right to take it from them . You do n't understand . I help people . What do you do ? You stupid bitch ! Hope ! This is not helping . Court is recessed . Bailiff , take the jury out . How can you just sit there and let them crucify me ? I do n't need this , you know . I 'm leaving . Court officers , remove the defendant . This is not fair . All you tell them about is Oak Glade and Jubilee Towers . But I 've worked in homes for 15 years in between . And how many of them did you kill ? I did n't kill anybody . Maybe a few of them would n't pull through for me , but I have saved hundreds . Hundreds . And you do n't even care about them , do you ? Take your hands off of me ! Let go of me !

Listen , I knew you had a plane to catch , and I really wanted us to get together . And then this thing came up . I thought this place is just as good ... as long as you do n't put anything in your mouth . Honey , come here , look . This is Terry Bradshaw . This is the man Daddy 's gon na talk to about his new book . Hello ! Yo , Terry , hey . Steelers rule , man ! Listen , Ray , I 'm sorry .

Sit here . Honey , sit down . And let 's talk to the man . I can't . - I ca n't do this . - All right , you do n't have to . We do n't have to sit . We 'll just talk . I do n't think this is a good idea . I do n't normally do business like this . Of course you do n't . I know . I would n't have done this if I did n't think it was a great opportunity for both of us . I got some great ideas , really . Real quickly . I think the book should answer questions the public has always wanted to ask . Can I touch your head ? Hey , girl , look at this . You know , I can see you got your hands full . I know I do , but I still think we can talk for a little while . Mr . - Thanks , I think we did something here . - I 'm sorry . - All right . We had a good meeting . Laid a little foundation . I 'll have my people call your people . - You do that . - Okay . Who am I kidding ? This is " my people . " I do n't understand how the children got so sick . I mean , you do put coats on them , do n't you ? No , Marie , I send them out straight from the tub , buck-naked . Yes , of course they wear coats . - What coats ? - The coats that you bought them . I never see them wearing them . I know you never liked those coats . But I do n't think it 's worth endangering your children 's health ... - just to send me a message . - They wear the coats . You know , they 're very expensive coats . They 're good . They 're good , warm coats . - I bought bad coats . - No , they 're ... . - They 're fine , Marie . I just need to rest now . - Now , here . Blow . You know , I bought those coats from Frank 's friend , Leon . He said it was a deal . That crook . He sold me paper coats . If I can just make it to the phone . I should never listen to Frank . " Buy from Leon , " he said . " Leon has quality merchandise . " What he does n't say is that Leon wants to kill my grandchildren . Where 's the ketchup in this house ? - Oh , my God . What are you doing here ? - Looking for ketchup . That 's what you 're worried about ? It 's your fault that Debra and the kids are sick . - What ? - Your friend Leon , with his cheap coats . - Those coats were very expensive . - He made everyone sick . Please , my head . - They ripped the first day . - I did n't read the thing . You 're not supposed to sit in them . They 're not sit-down slacks . Please , you are actually killing me . See what you 're doing to her ? Go , please . She needs her rest . She should be up and moving around . She should walk it off . You do n't know what you 're talking about . You and your cheap coats . I know what sick people need . They need rest and peace and quiet . I know where the ketchup is . Upper left , refrigerator door . Upper left . That 's all I needed to know . Feel better , sweetheart . Ketchup . It 's great to see you again , Mr . Barone . It 's been quite a while . That 's ' cause Debra loves this part of being a parent . - Does this phone dial out ? - Why ? Is everything all right ? Yeah . Does n't matter . I just want the kids to get better . That 's all . - Do n't worry . Daddy 's here , okay ? - Now , that 's good . Sometimes I need a little help restraining the children when I examine them . Restraining the children ? You are a real doctor , right ? - How are you feeling , Ally ? - Crummy . She upgraded herself . This morning she was icky . - What has she been eating lately ? - Good things . Lots of green stuff . Sometimes hot , and sometimes cold . Debra does that mostly . - What about her sleeping habits ? - That , I know . I know that because I read her a book and tuck her in right about 8:00 . Well , if I 'm not at the game . Working . - I 'm a sports writer , you know . - That 's right . I remember . It 's kind of like that " tree falling in the forest " thing . You know ? But I read her the books . And I sing her the duck song , right , honey ? itte ducks , big ducks Lots of swinging ducks You have a lovely voice . Deep breath . She 's been around a lot of children who are sick ? Yes , in your waiting room . It 's like a hot zone out there , I 'll tell you . I mean , the children she plays with . Debra arranges the play dates , but then I go and pick her up sometimes . When you 're home . You sound like a typical dad . No , I 'm a very good dad . Yeah , I go on the road a lot , but when I come home ... then they 're all mine , right ? Like , what did we do last week ? We went to the video store , we got you your favorite video . I let them watch that as many times as they want . They love it . It 's great . They can sit in front of that thing for hours . Right ? We have fun , do n't we ? And Ally 's favorite video ? The Little Mermaid . No , Beauty and the Beast . Right . It 's the same thing . Ally , honey , I 'm going to take a look in your ears now , okay ? - Can you hold her for me ? - Yeah . It 's all right , now . Doctor 's making me do this . This is the doctor 's fault , okay ? - Daddy is still a great man . - Here we go . That 's it . All done . Go get yourself a lollipop . Ally seemed to have a touch of the flu . Let 's see how little Michael is doing . I 'm pretty sure that 's going to be the same thing , too . Mr . Barone , Michael seems fine to me . That 's impossible . No , I 'm telling you , there 's nothing wrong with that child . What are you talking about ? This morning ... . Feeling better , honey ? Yeah , you know , I think that garlic actually helped . To tell you the truth , I thought that was an old wives ' tale . Look who you 're talking to . Honey , button up your sweater , and let 's close your robe . I do n't want you to catch a chill . Is there anything else I can get for you ? Maybe I 'll just go upstairs for a while . No , you stay right here . I 'll go straighten out the covers . No , you do n't have to -- I know . I 've been ordering you around a lot today . But when of your own is sick ... you have to forget about winning a popularity contest . You 're in no danger . It 's nice to be taken care of for a change . Thank you . We 're both mothers . You know , there is not much difference between us . Is n't that right ? I do n't want to say the wrong thing . We are the same , are n't we , Frank ? Yeah , you 're exactly the same . Like me and Fabio . See , Frank thinks so , too . Okay , I 'm back ... with all the right children . How are the kids ? Daddy said we could watch TV until we get better . Dr . Hammond said they 'll be fine in about 24 hours . And he was amazed at how identical these twins are . You know , if they ever need x-rays , I bet we only have to bring in one . It was an honest mistake . Yeah , like father knows best . He brought the wrong kid . I know . I never mixed up you and Robert . Yes , you did , Dad . Thanks . - Good . - What happened to your shirt ? I was giving the kids their medicine . They love that stuff . Hello ? Oh , yes . He is . Just a minute , please . - It 's Terry Bradshaw . - Come on . Hi , Terry , yeah ? I 'm sorry about this afternoon . You know , being a parent is the toughest thing . Do n't you think ? No , I never had to see Mean Joe Greene naked . Yeah . Thanks , but my kid is still a little sick , and my wife 's still sick ... . You know what ? I do n't think so . All right , well , thanks . Okay , Terry , bye . What did you do ? His plane was delayed a few hours , and he wanted me to come visit him at the hotel . - And I told him , you know -- - What ? I told him what was important . What are you , out of your mind ? You 're gon na pass this up ? What are you talking about ? I 'm here . I 'm helping you with the kids , with the medicine . All right , not the medicine . Get Terry back on the phone before he hires somebody else . Is this a test ? Yeah . This is like the time you told me I could go to Bernie 's bachelor party . It 's not like Terry Bradshaw is going to give you a lap dance . What are you saying ? I do n't get you . Are n't you upset that I do n't know the kids as well as you ? No , Ray . I mean , you did your best . I needed you this morning and you were there for me . And now , I need you tonight to go and make the money . All right , I 'll call him . Right ? Yeah , six months ago . Right , I thought it was a little less crowded around there . Ray , come here . I mean , look , so you do n't know some things , you know ? But you 're trying , and you care , and you work hard . And your job takes you away a lot . But it 's because of your job you were able to pay the doctor today . - I was supposed to pay him today , right ? - Yeah . Here , take my temperature . You 're feeling a lot cooler . I think it 's time for a little " doctor and the patient . " Well , Mrs . Barone . Why are you taking your clothes off ? I 'm the dentist . Come on , Ray . - What ? - Because I 'm better , but I 'm tired . All right , do n't worry about it . I 'll walk it off . Or rub some dirt on it . I 'm glad we finally got some time to do this . I know we 've both been very busy . Okay , so tell me ... of all the places you 've played ... where would you say is your favorite ? In my room . Okay . Have you ever seen Mommy kiss the cable man ?

It 's my very own Patrick Ewing groin-pull doll . That 's nice , Peg . At least you wo n't be doing that to me now . This is the first time you 've been to a game so let me explain the rules of basketball . Rule number one , no talking . And when you break rule number one , and you will there 's rule number two , which is if I look at pretty girls walking up and down the aisles , and I will you ca n't say , " Are they prettier than me ? " Always know the answer will be , " Yes , she is . " And in some cases , " Yes , he is . " I 'm sorry , honey . I was pulling on Patrick . Did you say something ? - Not a word . - All , please rise . Tonight , singing our national anthem is Ms . Tina Turner . Oh , say can you see There 's more to see than this . What so proudly we hail Who wrote this song ? - AI , does n't that look like it could be ... ? - Shut up , Peg . At least it 's better than Roseanne . And the home of the brave Call me , Vlade ! And that concludes tonight 's national anthem . And now it 's time to meet your NB A All-Stars . And Danny Ainge . Al , I have to go to the bathroom . Come on , Al , I want you to go with me . - Why ? - To keep the men from leering at me . Peg , they 're not leering at you , they 're laughing at me . Honey , I really have to go . All right , but I do n't wan na miss the start of the game . I promise you wo n't . Come on , hurry . We 'll be quick . What a game . That was the most exciting quarter and a half of basketball I 've ever seen . Well , you know I told you about putting your hands down your pants in public . Well , it 's the only fun I 've had in this game so far , Peg . What I 'd like to do is watch the rest of it in complete , total and uninterrupted silence , okay ? Okay , sweetie . Hey , Riley , nice hair . What , are you using 30-weight now ? Hey , Barkley , you 're playing like a virgin . Al , you 're being obnoxious . You 're supposed to act like that at a game . The players love it . It shows you appreciate the sport . Hey , baldy . Are you a real player , or did Sinead O'Connor get a tan ? That 's the wrong guy , Peg . That 's Xavier McDaniel . They call him the X-Man . Oh , he 's coming this way , Peg . You do n't know me . X , I might leave him alone . He played high school football . You 'll hear it from me . You 'll be leaving the game on a stretcher . Hey , could n't we start things off as friends ? Could you help me get Shaquille O'Neal 's autograph ? You know , it is better being here in person . That 's the end of the first half , with the score tied at 81-81 . That 's good . I came to at just the right time . Hey , Al , could you change seats with me ? I ca n't see . You ca n't see what , Peg ? It 's halftime . Yeah , but I think that 's Joe Piscopo over there . Over there , Peg ? That 's an usher . Wait a second , that is Joe Piscopo . Honey , change seats with me . I wo n't ask you for another thing . I promise . Come on . And tonight 's lucky contestant is sitting in section eight row B , seat two . That 's me ! That 's me ! - It 's me . It 's you ? - Congratulations , miss . Right this way . But wait a second . No , see , see . She 's not me . I 'm her . That was my seat . We switched . Tell him , Peg . It 's me . It 's me ! She does n't have a chance of making the shot . That 's the way we like it . - Right this way . - Oh , come on , let 's go . And now , the precision choreography of our own All-Star cheerleaders . Hi , Vlade . My name is Kelly . I can make you very happy . You can show me how to set my VCR ? If necessary . Here 's my phone number . - There 's only six numbers . Ms . Bundy , we 'll be shooting in about five minutes . Here are the rules . You get one shot from the free-throw line . Make it , and you win $10,000 . - Sounds easy . - Any questions ? Yeah , just one . What 's a free-throw line ? Do n't spend it all in one place . She 'll be ready , wise guy . Shave your head , give me your hair , I 'm taking the shot . Do n't be ridiculous , Al . I 'm sure that if I practice , I can be just as good as that Smoking Joe Louis or any of those other quarterbacks . Another slow day , eh , God ? Okay , now , look , Peg . - Now , pretend that I 'm the basket . - I do n't know , honey . I 've pretended you 're a lot of things : A cowboy , a knight , Mr . T , dead , but a basket ... Peg , concentrate . This is $10,000 . Just one great one . All right , now , relax , take aim , bend your knees and let the ball roll slowly off your fingertips . Perhaps I did n't make myself clear the first time . Peg ! NBA action , it 's fantastic . And now it 's time to play Bask et-O-Cash . Tonight 's lucky contestant is a woman . From Chicago , Ms . Peg Bundy . Ms . Bundy says she 's married to a successful doctor and not to Al Bundy the shoe salesman . And now , presenting the Bask et-O-Cash ball a starting guard for the Portland Trail Blazers and proud member of America 's Olympic Dream Team Clyde " The Glide " Drexler . You know , anyone can do that . I have to make it from here . Do n't worry about it . Just think of the line from that famous commercial . Oh , you mean , " Just do it " ? Well , no . Good luck , Ms . Bundy . Do n't be nerv ous . Ten thousand dollars riding on this shot . Ten thousand people rooting for you . Or against you . Ten ... Go ahead and shoot it , baby . The court 's all yours , Peg . Ten thousand dollars . Gee , I wonder if I could get a cheerleader for that . Ten thousand dollars . Gee , I wonder if I could get a player for that . Hey , if we 'd had her instead of Ainge , we 'd have won the championship . Now , now , Peg . Now , that 's all right . You gave it your best shot . - You 're not disappointed , Al ? - Disappointed , Peg ? It 's the only way it could be . I wanted it , I needed it , I deserved it . How else could it have turned out ? - Then it 's your fault . - From the minute I said , I do . I guess not , Peg . Come on , sweetheart , let 's go . Okay .

Come on . - So your two-week review is coming up . - Oh , yeah ? I do n't think you have anything to worry about . The fresher the milk , the more delicious the cheese will be . Obviously , it would be best if you had your own cow . But if you 're not willing to make that sort of commitment , just buy milk and warm it up , but very slowly , on the stovetop . Now , when we come back from break , I 'll go into the different coagulants . Okay , back in ten . - Hi . - Hey . I just wanted to return your book . Thank you . Josh told me you quit , huh ? I did . - Yeah . And now you make cheese ? No , no , it 's just ... it 's a new hobby . Just trying to fill my head with other thoughts . Look , Gaby , I 'm so sorry for what happened that night that I , um , made you talk in an accent . And then told me it was n't up to scratch ? I actually , like , really needed a kick in " zee " butt . So thank you . It was a good wake-up call . I do n't think you know this , but ... I used to get into work early every single day so I could watch you walk down the street ... sort of see you out in the world . I would imagine that I was somebody that you did n't know , and you would accidentally bump into me , and then we would ... Okay , everyone , break 's over . Let 's go make cheese . You should keep this . I underlined passages ... not very subtle ... but I actually think page 35 is more for you now . - Page 35 . - Yeah . - Got it . - Mm .

That is what I 'm talk ... - Hey . - Just gon na ditch me ? - What ? - After I found her for you ? - I was just getting ... - Bullshit . And you went to my mother behind my back ? What kind of man does that ? The kind of man who has his eyes on the mother-effing prize , who is n't mooning over a red dress , ' cause the way I see it , man , you either want to find her or you don't . - Oh , I do . - Then do whatever it takes . Oh , I will , but I will not trust you . Oh , God . I think I 'm gon na cry . - Did you get the intel ? - Yeah . He wanted more money , but I took care of it . - You got , what , gum ? - I did what I had to do . So are you ready to go find her ? Yeah . You got to be kidding me . - Do n't do that . - What ? Do not be the guy that does not think that Chris Martin has it all figured out . Oh , my God . How are you gon na make that ? You are worrying way too much . We 're all good . I have all the logistics . I have all the data . All we have to do is head there on Wednesday ... Can I have an espresso and a croissant , please ? Yeah , do you want it to stay or to go ? How about to stay ? - Hey . - Hey . Uh , that 's all right . I do n't want to interrupt . You 're not . I was just leaving . - So next Friday ? - Yeah . It 's a business associate . I did n't ask . You did n't have to . Come on , why do n't you sit with me for a minute ? Princeton ... fancy . Following your dreams ? More like following the path of least resistance . I created an algorithm for my senior thesis . A few companies out here became interested , and ... What does the algorithm do ? - You really interested ? - So far . Okay . Well , let 's say one day you happen to meet a tall , good-looking guy that you think you might want to marry . For the sake of the story . Well , madame , we 've just met , so this certainly is n't an offer . Well , give it a minute . - I 'm kidding . - Touch ? . Anyway , so you 're online . You 're searching for rings and venues , and my algorithm says , " Hey , someone in here is a romantic , wedding-planning fool . " And then companies start sending you coupons for DJs and honeymoon places . It kind of helps the marketplace to ... But I like to say I 'm helping people find ... Buy more shit . Sorry . I 'm sorry . That 's really impressive . So you run a tech company ? I did run a tech company . And about six months ago , I got some offers to sell ... and here I am . Yes , here you are . You know , I know this is out of the blue , but , um , Saturday I 'm having a barbecue ... Some friends , some family coming by . Why do n't you join us , have some lunch , a few drinks ? - No . - Whoa . Sorry . It came out wrong . I-I would love to . It 's just , you know , new job and , um , a lot on my plate right now . Okay , well , yeah , no . No pressure . But just in case ... Keyes . Uh , Patrick , this is , uh , Florence , the new IT guy . The IT guy ? Got to watch those IT guys . He knows where the bodies are buried . - Ha ! - Anyway ... - Give me a call , just in case . - Great . - You guys have a great day . - Yeah . We 're not even halfway there , and at the rate we 're going through gas and snacks ... We need to eat every two hours to maintain peak performance . Whatever . Look , the point is $213.12 ... Is definitely not gon na get us there . We need to figure out how to get more . We need to get smart . So I ca n't buy protein shakes , but you can buy books ? Short cons . Let 's make some money the old-fashioned way . Start reading . I 'll give you a dime for every quarter you can lay on end . - Sir ? - How you doing ? Hi . Ten in a row . " Chapter one , The Fundamentals ... " No short-con repertoire would be complete " without the classic distraction maneuver " known as the ' bait and switch . ' " The key is picking the appropriate unsuspecting target . " So we 're really gon na do this ? I mean , I want to find her , man . I really do , but ... this guy and his family ? - That 'll make us just as bad as ... - Ava . You know , one of those books said you ca n't cheat an honest man . Yeah , I read that . I still do n't get it . - Hey , thank you . - You 're welcome . It 's like there are people who set themselves up to be taken because they 're , you know , greedy or selfish or mean . You know what ? We need some ground rules . We need , like , a code of conduct for how far we 're willing to go ... the true warrior must hold that loyalty , courage , and honor are important above all else . Nice . - No old people . - Sure . Yeah . No kids . No people who look , you know , sad . Yeah . No nice moms or dads ... or anyone who 's limping . No babies . What does that leave us ? Hey , lady ... next time get both hips replaced . Assholes . Excuse me there , bud . Uh , you know , I seem to have gotten a little bit lost . Maybe you could help me out here . Sure . I 'm tourist information today ... where you going ? So we are heading , um , to the east , and we need a ... I 'm trying to get on the 29 here . Yeah , that 's where your finger 's pointing ... - Right there , the 29 . - That 's right . Oh . Okay , that would make sense . What ? What are you two zibs doing ? You should be more careful with this , sir . What the hell ? Are you trying to lift my card , asshole ? Hey , he 's not an asshole . You 're the asshole . Oh , my God , an American eagle . Go , go , go ! He 's coming ! - I know ! I know ! - Go , go , go ! - I 'm going , I 'm going ! - Go , go ! - Okay ! - Turn , turn , turn ! - I 'm turning ! - Oh , God ! That did not go well ! I know ! I was there ! His big hobby , his passion is darts . - Yeah . - No , he 's in a darts league that competes every Friday at a pub called St . James 's Well . Oh , give me a break , Max . Maddie , I want to make something very clear . This job happens to be of special interest to the Doctor . Max is just freaking out ' cause I had coffee and talked to some guy at a coffee shop . No , it 's the way that you were talking to him that concerns me . You know what , Sal ? Why do n't you tell her about Tulsa ? - Max ... - No , tell her , Sal . - She needs to know . - What ? What happened in Tulsa ? It was almost ten years ago , I guess . We 'd just started working for the Doctor . It was a ... a long game ... a real-estate scam ... and about the hottest summer you can imagine , so I went to the movies a lot . And this guy was ... sitting a few seats from me one night , and he offered me some Junior Mints . We just seem to fit . You know , sometimes you get a taste of real life , and it seems pretty all right . You start daydreaming , you know ... about getting out for good . So what happened ? Well , let 's just say the Doctor sent me a message ... a little reminder that anybody not in the life , not like us , is a liability . And if you care about those people , you know ... you have to be careful . And sweet Max ... was there to put me back together , were n't you , Maxie ? Anything for you , Sal . You know that . Ahh . All right , I get it . But this guy at the coffee shop ... he 's a nobody . You do n't have to worry . Really , I 'm on it . Want something ? Yeah . I 'll have a Manhattan , please . - Mm-hmm . - Keep the change . I need a little favor . Why not ? If I let you , it 'll cost me more . All right , all right , fair enough . How about if I can get you to say the word " seventeen " ? - Hmm ? - I bet I can get you to say " seventeen , " and if I do , you have to join us . - You 're on . - All right . - What 's two plus two ? - Four . - Four plus four ? - Eight . - Eight plus eight ? - Sixteen . See , I told you I could get you to say " sixteen . " - No , you said " sevente " ... - See ? What ? You walked right into that one . Okay , I 'm impressed . All right , you can buy me a drink now . - All right . - What 's going on here ? Mr . Heller . Gary , you ... know this one ? Ms . Keyes works for me . What are you doing here ? I live right around the corner . Just getting to know the city . Is this a good spot ? Well , you have to go where the darts are if you 're in a darts league . Big darts game tonight ? Match . It 's called a darts match . Oh . Big darts match tonight ? You know , the game of darts goes back to the Battle of Agincourt in the 15th century . The first dartboard was actually the cross section of a tree . Wow . You 're a real enthusiast . I kind of like history in general . I like the perspective on why things happen . Hmm . Hmm . Never been my favorite subject . I do love old movies , like " Casablanca . " Mm , that 's kind of history , right ? Ms . Keyes , you are a breath of fresh air . Call me Saffron . We 're not at work . Gary , more vodka shooters before I take your money . Oh , and , um , when I come back , will you teach me how to shoot a dart ? Okay , but are you sure you do n't want the reigning champ to teach you ? Positive . I imagine Gary knows what he 's doing . Vodka , vodka , water . Drink them under the table . Ahh ! Okay , okay , okay . There 's a lot of money on that table ... I 'm nervous . No , no , I got your covered . Do n't worry about it . Do n't believe him ! Gary 's not exactly on a winning streak . Ignore that . Just ignore that . Focus just on this . Breathe . Just breathe . Do it ! Aah ! Oh , my gosh ! In your face ! That is bullshit ! No , no , no , that is such bullshit . Let 's go again , double or nothing . Double or nothing , let 's go again . I think I better quit while I 'm ahead . Hey , Gary is a pussy , okay ? You do n't have to be a pussy . And he 's , like , so cranky . He 's so cranky . Ever since Patty left him for the pool boy ... Keep talking , Freddy . Keep talking . - Jesus , calm down . - Keep talking . - Apologize to the lady . - I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! - Apologize to the lady . - Relax , man ! Gary , Gary , can we please just get out of here ? Please ? What the hell ? Sorry I lost my temper back there . No , it 's okay . You were just defending my honor . I do n't feel so good . Get you a glass of water . I know people say you 're a jerk , but ... they just do n't know the real you . I 'm just gon na put this here . You 're gon na need that ... - Yes ? - I was just wondering if there was gon na be a smoked brisket involved . Wait . So you 'll come based on the meat ? Yes . Yes , that 's the deciding factor . Done . So what 's up for tonight ? Uh , not much . Just a quiet evening at home . You ? Not a lot ... just getting my daily dose of jazz . You hear it ? Love that one . Crank it up . You 've got something right here on your ... - Me ? - What is that ... ketchup ? - What ? - Huh ? - Okay , not bad . - You felt it ? - A bit , a bit . - Ah . - Okay , my turn . - All right . Taxi ! - Oh , I 'm so sorry . - No worries . Ooh , man , only a slight breeze that time . - Yeah ? - Yeah , it 's getting better . All right . - Let 's go . I could use a little " Viva La Vida " right about now . Okay , how about this ? From now on , whoever has the wallet controls the radio . Deal , baby . Let the game begin . What the ... How 'd you do that ? - Thank you . - Son of a bitch . " At the bottom of every frozen heart , there is a drop or two of love ... " Till death do us part . " Just enough to feed a birds . " This better work . - It 's sourdough , right ? - Yep . Here you go . Thanks . It 's all old folks . Not an asshole in sight . Should we just go ? Oh . You know ... Hey , does " wheat " sound anything like " sourdough " ? You know , put a nickel in it , honey . Assholes trump old people . Good amendment . It 's a living document . Mustard dip . - You toast it ! Next , casually spill a condiment of your choosing on your unsuspecting mark . Here , let me give you a hand . Now , in one simple , fluid motion , remove your mark 's jacket .

@@5238141 These deodorants are a rip-off , they always run out by the time I get to my feet . Dick , the mail 's here . Ooh , it 's my package from the carousel Cd club . You infiltrated a club ? - Good work , Harry ! I got 10 CDs for one penny . All I 've got to do is buy eight more at regular store prices which are often at or below retail store prices . Well , way to go . - Like taking candy from a baby . Such primitive technology . I wonder if the people on this planet will ever discover the superior sound of vinyl . What kind of music did you get ? - I told them to surprise me . well , this is surprising . Uh ... why am I doing this ? Same reason I 'm doing this , I suppose . This is very powerful . I 'm feelin ' funky This is not good . I ca n't stop ! - Nobody panic . Let 's get out of here ! Enriched wheat flour , Butylated Hydroxyanisole , sodium acid pyrophosphate . The world has changed , huh ? It sure has . Once it was completely covered with ice . The administration office called . They contacted Stanford about transferring your graduate records , but they do n't seem to have them . Are you implying that I do n't have records ? All humans have records , and I 'm a human . Therefore , I have records . I 'm sorry , but Stanford says they have no record of you at all . Oh , those incompetents . Do I have to fly out to Denver and straighten this out myself ? Stanford 's in California , not Denver . Well , that explains it . They lost my records in the move . So you were at Stanford in the ' 60s . Ah , who was n't ? - I was at Berkeley . God , that takes me back . I remember I was at Stanford once to protest at .. - Apparently so . It was fun though was n't it ? Out-of-control , mind-numbing , self-destructive fun . It sounds like a clich��� ? but I actually remember burning my bra in front of the Lincoln reflecting pool . I hope you had the good sense to jump in and put yourself out . God , I was a rebel . You would n't believe it to look at me now , but back then I was a wild woman . If I wanted to do something , I just did it . Did you ever drop acid ? - Oh , constantly . You did a lot of tripping ? - That 's how I dropped the acid . No , seriously , I want to know . Were you involved in any movements ? - Well , uh , uh , this one . It 's one of my favorites . Dr . Solomon , every time I ask you about your past , you change the subject . How 's your brother ? Dick , I 'm here . Let 's go . - You heard him . Got ta go . You call your father Dick ? - Yeah . When he was younger , I used to call him peanut . Have to run . See you tomorrow . Have a wonderful night . " What about Tommy " " He'Il miss you when you go " " Ma 's on her own " " Karen 's almost grown " this is so sad . " Worried so " ... country singers have really tough lives . " stay with Dad awhile " Why ? What 's her complaint ? She lives in a trailer . She could just roll away somewhere , and the Cd club would never find her . What are you talking about ? Do you have any idea what 's involved with this ? The paperwork , the decisions . Why did n't I go with the cheese of the month club ? No guesswork , just cheese . That was a fiasco . So what ? Exactly how far back did you establish our identities ? Five or six ... months . Your assignment was to provide full and complete histories for all of us . I had a book report due on " are you there , god ? It 's me , Margaret . " Tommy , I 'm not sure you understand the importance of this . Humans are creations of their past . Society , culture , even biology , demand that they carry around their past like baggage . And your lack of effort almost exposed the entire operation . Fine . So from now on , my homework comes last . Those are the house rules , mister . Hello ! Hello ! I found those books on the ' 60s . - Good , good . Never mind the bourbon stains . - Thank you , Mrs . D . Oh , the ' 60s . What a lovely , lovely decade . Those long-haired freaks thought they were so cool . Let me tell you one thing . I was reading poetry with Jack Kerouac in a cage in 1956 , both of us buck naked . Yes , well , thank you for that disturbing visual . I did n't hear Kerouac complain . Aw , " the electric kool-Aid acid test . " Getting nostalgic ? - Ah , yes , " those were the days , my friend . " But you know , all this uproar , all this rhetoric , all this talk about mass movements what 's happening here ? History is made by the individual , not by the masses . Who said that ? - I did . No , where is that from ? - My mouth . No , somebody said that . Hello . That was me . This is so weird . Right on . - You 've been rinsed and hung out to dry . Think about it . Dig it , babe . That 's what 's happening . wow ! - That 's beautiful . What 's the matter ? - I could n't put it together until now . It finally clicked .. the evasiveness , consistencies in your past . Dick Solomon is a false identity , is n't it ? False identity ? Me ? You could have trusted me , you know . Well , I , I , I , I .. - There are so many people in the government who would love to get their hands on you . You ca n't let that happen . They 'd parade me around like an animal . Do n't worry . Your secret 's safe with me , Manny . Manny Rosenberg . But I 'm not Manny Rosenberg .. - Of course not , because Manny Rosenberg is still being hunted by the Fbi . For food or sport ? So Manny Rosenberg was .. what ? Manny Rosenberg was an act What ? Excuse me . Okay , where was I ? Manny Rosenberg was an activist involved in inciting a riot in 1971 . All right , I found another box in the basement . What 's " x-mas " ? - I do n't know , but it 's got to be something psychedelic . Check this out . This is heavy . - Far out . My mind is blown . - Who is this ? I think it 's jerry Garcia . Look , here 's a picture of Manny Rosenberg . He looks exactly like you . Oh , damn ! I was supposed to get a completely original body . Those guys in research ca n't do anything right . What do you expect ? They 're non-union . This could really be trouble . Tommy , how are you coming along with our histories ? I have them right here legal documents , school records , doctored pictures , the works . Dick Solomon , class nerd , held back by a domineering mother , went to work for Nasa in ' 74 , but was fired after a minor procurement scandal . Newspaper clippings are enclosed . - This is excellent . What about me ? - Stockbroker during the greedy ' 80s . Made and lost several fortunes before psychological problems and gender confusion led to a sex change operation in 1988 . I 'm next . - Harry , you 're adopted , but we have n't told you yet . Ohh , that 's gon na hurt . Dr . Albright , I 'm glad you 're here . Good morning , Dr . Solomon . Yes , well , I 'd like to clear up a few misunderstandings about yesterday . For some reason , you mistakenly think that I 'm this Manny Rosenberg fellow . I brought in this documentation to prove ... . Oh do n't even bother . I told you you could trust me . You probably do n't remember , but we 've actually met before . You spoke at my campus in ' 69 . Now , that 's impossible . I was in the circus then . The flying solomoskis . There were six of us . You 're sitting on my desk . You 've never done that before . Do you remember ever being at Berkeley , at a rally ? You 're not listening to me . I brought all this in to prove to you the stories you must have . - What ? You know I 'd be lying if I said I found this less than intriguing . Well , all those years underground , you do a lot of living . Harry ? You got another package from the Cd club . I do n't have time to listen to the ones I have . Those demons , they 're not human . Neither are we . Well , yeah , but we have an excuse . Hello . I 'm off to Dr . Albright 's . She bought my phony profile , huh ? - I do n't even need it . She likes me much better , now that she thinks I 'm Manny . hello . - For you . You should n't have . I 'm glad you came . And to think all this time I was just a desk away from danger . The thought of the F.B.I . watching us right now is such a turn-on . Yes . And even if I was n't Manny , it would be just as exciting . Do n't be silly . Are these ... " magic " brownies ? Pepperidge farm . You know , I think I have something . I found it when I moved eight years ago . It 's in the freezer . It 's a joint . Oh , a doobie . Let 's Bogart that fat boy . You know what I regret ? I never made it to Woodstock . Found it ! - The song was popularized by Crosby , stills Nash , which is ironic since theirs was the more commercial version which is the antithesis of the spirit of the festival . Here we go . This is n't a joint . It 's a frozen French fry . Oh , well , I guess we 'll just settle for wine . You 're an inspiration to all ... neo-trotskyite anti-Stalinist Marxists . You know , you 're pretty tuned in for a bourgeois chick . Meet me on the waterbed upstairs in five minutes . Oh , and , uh ... lose the pins . What ? Here 's to ... waterbeds . Okay .. here 's to ... floor lamps . Hello . Carousel Cd club ? I 'll call back later . - Do not hang up that phone . You can do this , Harry . You can break free . You can take your mind back , or at least what 's left of it . I 'm not happy , and I want my money back . Very good . - I 'm supposed to press " 2 " now . Yes . Hello ? We need to talk . I 'm at a place in my life where I 'm just not ready for this kind of commitment . I think it 's best that we break free , go our separate ways . You will ? Oh , thanks ! Hmm ? Well ... yes , I guess I do have a friend who might be interested . Her name is Sally Solomon . Oh ! Oh , I ca n't believe we 're doing this . Your hands are so small and delicate . I 'm not positive , but I think I can fit your entire foot in my mouth . Oh ! You are a superfreak . " The kind you do n't take home to mother . " Oh , Manny , Manny ! Now I 'm feeling a moral dilemma . I 'm not sure I can go through with this . What the hell ... ? - Do n't be uptight , babe . Leave your hang-ups in suburbia . You 're leaving ? - You bet your bippy I am . hey ! - You miserable creep ! I do n't understand . - Think about it . It 's like you put a purple haze inside my brain . Give it a rest . What did I do wrong ? - You know what you did . Come on , Manny . Berkeley .. 1969 . Oh , you 're mad at Manny . Yes , Dr . Albright is mad at Manny . Oh ! Oh , Manny . It 's okay because I have something to tell you that 's going to straighten this whole thing out . I 'm not Manny . Is n't that ironic ? Right , you 're not Manny . You just look exactly like him , know everything about his past , and have been carrying on this ridiculous charade for three days . You know me so well . I want you . Oh , my god , you ARE Dick Solomon . And you let me make a complete fool of myself ! How could you do that ? I needed to tell you . I was going to tell you . What stopped you ? - I thought you might sleep with me . Oh . Now I understand . - Oh , thank goodness . Get out ! You selfish , inconsiderate , opportunistic bastard ! You 're right . I guess I 'll be going . About inconsiderate , I did bring brownies . I sure am glad you wo n't be getting any more of these CDs in the mail . Yeah , and even if we do , there 's no reason to think that I would have anything to do with it cause I did n't . Dick , someone 's here to see you . I do n't want to be seen . Tell them that I 'm not here . He 's not here , Dr . Albright , so go away .. and because you realise that my deceit , although sophomoric , was meant as a pure gesture of affection . Well .. some of that . Would you leave the two of us alone for a minute ? Sure . Remember every word . We want all the details . Will do . Look , I .. I may have overreacted to this Manny thing . And I understand that men have a tendency to go overboard to impress me . I understand that . The only reason I pretended to be Manny is because you liked him so much more than me . Manny was n't what he seemed , but you are exactly what you seem . And I 'll admit that your lack of nuance is refreshing . Damn , I think I 'm wearing Harry 's underwear again . Well , a little nuance would n't hurt . So we 're still friends ? Peace .

It 's so terrible . Oh , my gosh . Do n't even look at me . I am such a mess . I am the lowest of the lowest . You 're gon na want to get my other suitcase out in the hall . - What happened ? - My apartment . It 's like the barrio or the projects or whatever . And I live there . I am a girl from the projects . I do n't know about that . Get this . I tried to call Doyle - - I have sunk that low . And there was no answer , so here I am . Not that you were the last resort , but I had nowhere else to go . Roaches . Live ones , dead ones . All skinny feet and creepy antlers . - Antlers ? - Oh , my God . I wonder how many are in that bag . Also , the water is all brown and spurty and not hot . I am dying for a shower . I actually smell . Smell me .

Of course you do . - Angel , you around ? - Hey , Doyle . You ever get that feeling like you just ca n't shower enough like you 'll never be clean ? - You got peanut butter on the bed . - Really ? I do n't think so . I 'll look . No , no , no , no , no . Angel , how could you ? How could I what ? You know I was crazy about her . I was wearing her down too . But , no . Handsome , brooding vampire guy has to swoop in all sensitive mouth and overhanging forehead . I was on the sofa . That 's okay , I suppose . At some point in recent history , you got peanut butter on the bed . It 's gross . You 'd better change the sheets . I do n't eat . Then I do n't even want to know how it got there . Hey , you 're looking great . I would n't know . Man does n't have a mirror . Like it 'd kill him to not see himself ?

You gon na tell me what 's going on ? You do n't even know who the demon 's collecting for . Here 's how it works . I owe some people , other people owe me . I do a favor , the debt goes away . It 's a system of checks and balances . Some of your checks did n't balance . Well , it 'll work out . It just takes a little diplomacy . The kind of thing you 're so good at , actually . Maybe you could take a crack at it . We all have problems . At the moment , I have a bigger one than you do . - Bigger than a Kailiff demon ? - Much . You can help me with mine , and I can help you with yours . I do n't know , man . I mean , what 's your problem exactly because vampire business is ... . Hi . I wish you 'd let me call my guy . He probably judges the property value on how far the bus ride is to the track . It ca n't get any worse than this . You ca n't tell from the hallway . Hey , you 're right . You know what I smell in here ? Potential . The next one 'll be better . It 's like a community . We share all the upkeep and chores . My urination has n't been public enough lately . We do n't believe in barriers . It 's the first rule of the Great Leader . You can come to meetings . Mornings at 5 . Okay . That 's just a touch too early for me . Oh , you 'll be up .

Really , really , it 's just perfect . It 's amazing in there . - What 's wrong with it ? - Nothing 's wrong with it . The previous tenant just broke their lease . I do n't know how you heard about it . It 's quite a bargain . And the furniture comes with . Do you think you want it ? I used to have this . I was -- - I guess it 's your lucky day . - I used to have those too . - Yeah , she 'll take it . - I 'll fill out the rental forms .

I do n't know his name . - You can get a message back to him ? - Yeah . - You 're letting me go ? - I 'm letting you up . - You were sent to collect for Doyle ? - At first . But I 'm not seeing any money . So now Doyle gets dead . A message for the others . And your boss never gets his money . You have my guarantee . I saw what I saw , right ? You 're a vampire . How come you 're helping some demon half-breed7 . It 's a good offer . You should take it . On the other hand , you 're making me want to fight . You get lucky , you might last 10 minutes . Really lucky , and you 're unconscious for the last five . You get Doyle to pay , and he 's safe . Thanks . Good meeting . What do you think you 're doing here ? You never should have come , I have to pay ? Man , I should have just handled this myself . I do n't have the money . You ca n't get blood out of a stone . They can get blood out of you . There 's a price on your head . They were n't looking for money . Thanks , man . You probably saved my life . - Seems like you 'd understand . - I do . Yeah . I do n't know why it 's important to you . This kind of life sort of picked me . You do n't have to do it this way . - What happened ? - Do n't worry about it . And things are n't all gloom in Doyle City . I mean , there 's bright spots . Like Cordelia . I mean , she loves that new place so much , man . She 's gon na be grateful for a long time . I knew this was too good to be true . I knew it . I 'm from Sunnydale ! You 're not scaring me , you know ! You 're not scaring me . ... one bit . Bright , shiny morning . Nothing bad here . You know what ? I get it . You 're a ghost . You 're dead . Big accomplishment . Move on ! Scary . What are you gon na do , chap me to death ? What else you got ? Cordelia , you in there ? Cordelia ? Cactus . It 's a housewarming present . Hi . Thanks . I 'm still getting it the way I want it . Maybe in a few days . The place looks great . You worry too much . But what did you have against that chair ? Oh , right , you ca n't come in . Wait . What about the rule ? You said when you got a place , I was invited over . I did n't have a place then . The rules are getting screwed up ! - Do n't touch that ! - I 'm closing these so our boss does n't burst into flames . Okay ? Yeah . I guess . It 's nice . How about a tour ? The kitchen , living room . I 'll knock out that wall . - Thanks for the cactus . I think the mantle is uneven . It lunged at me . What 's going on ? Okay , you 're right . It 's not the mantle . It 's a very , very bad trophy . - Dear sweet ... . - Come on . I 'm not giving up this place . - It 's haunted . - It 's rent-controlled ! - It says , " Die . " - Maybe it 's not done yet . Maybe it 's " Diet . " That 's friendly , if a little judgmental , sure . I am not giving it up . It 's perfect and beautiful . It 's so me . I need it . It 's just a place . - You 're more than that . - How ? How am I more than that ? We could cleanse it . We could try . Ca n't we ? Put the ghost to rest . - Can we ? - We can try . - We 'll figure it out at the office . I 'll die before I give up this apartment ! I 'll die ! All right , dear , If that 's what you think is best , A lot here about the building . - Construction bids , inspections -- - We need people who lived there . And died there . The ingredients for ghosts . Yeah . This is n't easy , you know . You know , this really is just a place to live . No , it 's more . It 's beautiful . - And if it goes away , it 's like -- - Like what ? - Like I 'm still getting punished . - Punished ? - For what ? - I do n't know . For how I was . For everything I said in high school because I could get away with it . And then it all ended , and I had to pay . But this apartment - - I could be me again . Punishment over . Welcome back to your life . Working for redemption . No , because you had that mansion . I found something . Ladies and gentlemen , we have a death . First person to live in your place , Maude Pearson . - How 'd you get it ? - Pearson Arms is carved over the entrance . I checked the obits for Pearson . We got lucky . Maude Pearson built the place and took a unit there . In 1946 , she died of a heart attack in Cordelia 's living room at age 57 . That 's it ! That 's her . It 's not a violent death . - Ghosts are usually -- - I know it 's her . The place has that weird little-old-lady smell like violets and Aspercreme . They did n't find her for 3 weeks , so it was n't violets at the end . This is easy . Little-old-lady ghost hanging around because she left the iron on . Get a cleansing spell and do it . It 's not easy . Hawthorn berries , lungwort and bile . Goody . One of Doyle 's guys . Is this the same guy that helped me find my poltergeist-elicious apartment ? Doyle , go . Get what you need . I 'm gon na try to get more information . Maybe Kate can find something . How come Patrick Swayze 's never dead when you need him ? Angel Investigations , We help the hopeless , If that 's you , leave a message , Cordelia , are you there ? I think we can end this thing , I 'm here . About time you called . You got something ? Meet me at your apartment , We 'll figure out what to do , Okay . Cordelia , I 'm in the bedroom . Angel ? You got my call . Poor thing . You just do n't fit in around here , do you ? Oh , too bad you would n't leave my son alone . Your son ? - I wish I could be more help . - It 's okay . - I am one . The thing about detectives is , they have r ? sum ? s business licenses and last names . - Pop stars and popes have one name . - I 'm a pope . Here you go . Davis , you are beautiful . Thank you . Let 's take a look . I did n't know you had records that old . Me neither . Let 's see . There was an investigation into the death . This guy , Detective Randall , thought the death was suspicious . The M.E . called it a heart attack but there were problems with the son , Dennis Pearson . - He lived with her . They argued a lot . - What about ? A girl . His fianc ? e . Mom did n't like her . Dennis skips town with her the day Mom dies . What a coincidence . - Cops never caught him . - Unavenged murder . - Sounds like . - But no other deaths in the apartment . No , not murders . Suicides . There 's a kind of killer that does that . Makes it look like a suicide . There are always signs . There . Margo Dressner , 1959 . And Jenny Kim , 1965 . Natalie Davis , 5 years ago . All in the same apartment . I 've got ta make a call . Angel Investigations . We hope you 're helpless . - Wait -- - It 's me . Put Cordelia on . She 's not here . Hang on , there 's a message . Are you there ? We can end this thing , I 'm here , About time you called , You got something ? Meet me at your apartment , We 'll figure out what to do , That 's not me . Whoever you think you 're talking to , it 's not me . My name is Cordelia . Oh , that 's the name of a cheap , small-town tramp trying to sound better than she is . You 're not good enough for my boy . You do n't have friends . Why would anyone care about you ? Nobody really cares . You do n't deserve to live here . You do n't deserve anything . We were right about the ghost . It 's Mrs . Pearson . - Her son killed her . - A murder victim ? Filled with rage and confusion . That 's why she 's been killing people . That 's a pretty strong ghost . Bile . I should 've got more bile . I will leave . Please . Oh , I do n't think so . - You 're worthless . - No . You 've never been kind or smart . You 're a user .

Well , why do n't we stick with " Wheels on the Bus " ? I do n't know anything that rhymes with clavicle , do you ? No . Exactly . The narrow pelvic inlet and flat profile of the skull indicate the victim was a Caucasian male , but it seems that his body was crushed by some kind of weight . That would be the woman who landed on him over there . Mm-mm . - Oh . Well , separating the peri from postmortem injuries will be quite challenging . What 's that smell ? Uh , someone doused the victim in corrosive chemicals . So it was a body dump . Yeah , but I 've never seen this pattern of decomposition before . That 's good for us . I 'll run an analysis back at the lab , see if I can figure out what kind of corrosives were used . Great . Uh , did you just say that ... the dirt had acid in it ?

Diabetes makes sense , given the extra organs I found . Uh , two pancreases and three kidneys , to be exact . Is n't it " pancrei " ? Pancreases . " Pancreata " is also acceptable .

This week on Gettin ' Spicy with Chili Reuben , you 're gon na want to fasten your seatbelts , because things are about to get muy caliente in the Spicemobile . I know how to cook ' em . And I know how to eat ' em . And there is n't a greasy spoon in this country I have n't hit . Mmm . Ah , here 's something . Look at the Twitter feed , huh ? Supposedly he was in D.C . last week shooting a new episode . I ca n't believe I missed him . When he was n't dead . Tell you what , maybe the producer 's still in town and we can talk to him . Oh . It 's a good lead . Hey , you got a minute ? Uh , hang on . I 'm cross-referencing the chemicals you found on the victim to see what products might match . Okay . Shoot . I got a call today from a company that wants to manufacture the honeycomb-structured ultra rubber covering that I invented . Oh . Honey , that 's amazing . Do you think it 's legit ? Well , I 'm having a lawyer look over the offer now , but if this checks out , this could be huge , Angie . Oh ... Oh , my God . 20 million ? Yeah . Whoa . Hold on . Does , um ... Okay . Wow . Does Cam know about this ? I mean , how do you think she 's gon na react ? If she had n't prevented you from working on it here , the ... the Jeffersonian would be getting most of that money . Yeah . You know what , let 's just wait and see if it all works out first . Yeah . Right ? Yeah . Okay . So ... looks like the sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid came from commercial cleaning substances . Drain cleaners . They 're both common brands , so that 's not gon na help us much . 20 million units . Just saying . I ca n't believe Chili is dead . We worked together for many years . On the show , Chili made it seem like the whole crew was family . Yeah . So you guys were close , though ? Chili and I had a real yin and yang thing going on , you know ? I was the calm one , Chili was the-the boisterous one . We were always friends . Right . When was the last time you saw him ? Friday afternoon . We spent the day shooting at different diners in D.C . After we wrapped , Chili got into the Spicemobile and drove off to do his own thing . Well , we found his car keys in his pocket and we already put out a , uh , search on the vehicle . Are you aware of any enemies he may have had ? Oh , look , Chili , he ... he may have had a big personality , but , uh ... And he could be a bit of a hothead . I 'm not gon na deny that , but people generally liked him . Be my guest . Uh , there 's a ton of footage because we have n't cut it together yet . Bet there 's some amazing stuff in there . I 'm happy to go through that . For the team . Why do n't you go back to your monitor ? Right . Oh . Mmm . Best fish tacos this side of the Mississippi . Mm-hmm . Up high . Yeah . He 's right , that place is amazing . Rolling . And action . Oh , yeah . Chicken and waffle ice cream might sound like these guys are winging it , but trust me , this stuff is mmm , mmm , mmm , finger lickin ' good . Well , that 's interesting . Oh , I think they deliver if you want to split a pint . No , no , I 'm talking about Chili 's earring . Does he always wear that ? Oh , yeah . That 's his signature - - the ruby chili pepper . Judgingfromthereview on Chili 's Twitter feed , the guy did n't pull any punches . Read that one . Perhaps one of the local restauranteurs decided to take their revenge ? Mm-mm . Not in the D.C . area . According to all the footage that we have so far , Chili , he 's given nothing but positive reviews . You still looking at , uh , the Twitter feed ? No . I'm_I 'm looking for words that rhyme with ... lachrymal , trapezium and ... pisiform . Right . Sorry I asked . Well , I want to compose an anatomically correct bones song for Christine , but songwriting is more difficult than I thought . Well , it would help if you were musically inclined . Well , what I need is a bone that rhymes with ethmoid . What about scaphoid ? More coffee ? Wow . Hey , wow , you speak squint , JoAnne . Thank you , JoAnne . Although , I do recall asking for no olives in my salad . Ah . Oh , I-I 'm sorry about that , Doc . I mean , I would have Frankie make you another one , except he 's kind of in a foul mood . Hurry up ! I need those fries ! You ... you know , I 'll pick ' em out for you . Thank you . Okay , here we go . That 's ... my ... Oh , phone call . I got it . I got it . Um ... It 's Aubrey . Aubrey , you solve the case ? Of the six greasy spoons that Chili visited in D.C . , he gave all but one a positive review . So we got a motive ? Yeah , and it 's one that you 're not gon na like . Listen to this . " The best burgers in the district " ? Maybe if you had your taste buds removed ! Why do you look so disappointed ? Because , um ... ' cause it 's Frankie . How many times do I have tell you ? ! Keep your mouth shut and do what I say ! Now get back to work ! That 's ... Wow . Frankie ? Order up ! Adam and Eve on a raft , wrecked . Cowboy with spurs . Cowboy with spurs ! Would you look at this - - my two best customers . Good to see you , Frankie , yep . I 'd like to visit , - but ... lunch rush . - I really hate to do this to you , Frankie , but , um ... Look , uh , you know , well , Chili Reuben was found dead , and this was the last place that he gave a bad review . We know this is difficult for you , but we have to ask you a few questions . I mean , look , hey , I 'd be upset , too . I 'd be really angry if somebody trashed my work . In his video , Chili called your burgers " bland and unmemorable . " I think they 're good . Chili trashed my food because I refused to pay him three grand for a good review . I 'm not paying blood money to some TV blowhard . He tried to extort you ? Was there any witnesses ? Well , the only one back here in the kitchen is my dishwasher , Glen . Excuse me . FBI Special Agent ... Booth . Sir , can you put that down , please ? Sorry about that . You would n't happen to have overheard Chili try to squeeze some money from my friend Frankie here ? I do n't pay much attention to anything that 's not my job . Okay . Frankie wo n't let me . You know I ca n't do that . That 's like you dropping your fries and putting them back on the plate . Man , I got to talk to you - - it 's my job , Frankie . Dr . Hodgins , have you found anything that might tell us what Chili was up to the night he was murdered ? You mean other than gorging himself ? Because so far all I have are fried potatoes , canola oil , beef , ketchup ... Well , I found evidence of alcohol and marijuana in his blood , so clearly , food was n't his only indulgence . There is one other thing that I found - - I am pretty sure that he had hyperhidrosis . Ooh . Excessive perspiration - - he just gets more and more appealing , does n't he ? Do n't turn your nose up at sweat . Our armpits have a story to tell . Yeah , from what I read of the victim 's file , I 'm guessing that is no fairy tale . Look , if Frankie is Chili 's killer , then that means JoAnne and the other waitresses will probably lose their jobs . Yeah , and we may lose our favorite lunch spot . Not that our history with the diner will affect our ability to remain impartial . But if another set of eyes could help ... You are a good , kind woman , Camille Saroyan . Just doing my job . Speaking of which , should n't you be in the bone room , Dr . Edison ? Yes , of course , but there is something that I want to show you first , so ... Okay , I lied . I have nothing to show you . I 'm confused . Okay , normally , I would n't put myself in the middle of these kind of things , and ... they have the potential to , uh , get a little awkward , so ... Do you mind cutting to the chase , Dr . Edison ? It 's Arastoo . It 's not weird , because we 're friends . Is something wrong ? Is he okay ? Nothing 's wrong . That 's the point . He just wanted me to reassure you that everything 's fine . Is there a reason why he did n't tell me this himself ? He said he did tell you , more than once , but you did n't seem to believe him . Well , because going back to Iran could get him arrested . Yeah , but he has n't been . He 's been with his brother - - that 's the only reason he has n't written more . He said Hamid is n't doing very well . No . But Arastoo is fine , Dr . Saroyan . And me worrying just makes it harder for him -- I get it . No , I ... I did n't say that . No , not in an obvious way . And for that ... well , thank you . Oh . Okay . Well , maybe ... maybe Chili was a sloppy drunk , and someone took advantage of him and stole it from him . Well , if those rubies are real , that could be a pretty valuable earring . Yeah , would n't be the first time that a robbery went wrong . I pulled Chili 's financials . Turns out he was flat broke . Wait a second , how does the star of a hit TV show end up broke ? Well , according to these records , a series of foolish investments , bad overspending , sports cars , houses in Aspen , Nantucket , Miami . Plus , the man did like his bling . Someone else did , too . We found his earring at a local pawnshop . Someone came in and pawned his earring two hours before Chili was killed . We get an I.D . on him ? Got a receipt . Lists him as Brian Terrio . Sorry to interrupt , but ... I 'm enhancing the pawnshop security footage , and I think I have a match . Why does that name sound familiar ? Because he worked on Chili 's TV show . Morton was the sound guy , and he 's got a record . Wow , look at the rap sheet , huh ? Breaking and entering , petty theft . Crew 's still at the hotel . All right , sounds good . Thanks , Angela . You got it . Take a look at this , Dr . Edison . Fractures on the victim 's left temporal and parietal bones that appear to have been caused by blunt force trauma from a single point of impact . Well , they must be from something big . The fractures extend all the way from the coronal suture , maxillary and zygomatic process . By measuring them , you might be able to determine the size and shape of the object that struck Chili 's skull . Dr . Brennan , I 'm confused about these notes . I was n't aware that we found injuries to the frontal , nasal , vomer or nasal conchae . Oh , that 's very nice . Well , if I was to write a song about all the fractures I found on these ribs , it might take an entire opera . They appear to run along a diagonal line across the sternal ribs , from three ... all the way down to rib eight on the left side . Well , Chili clearly got whacked there with something , too . Judging from the curvature of the indentations , the weapon must have had a cylindrical shape , like ... a golf club or pool cue . Or maybe something like this . The sound man 's boom pole . So ... two days ago your boss gets murdered , today we pick you up at the bus station , two grand in your pocket , about to skip town . I was going to Philadelphia to visit my mother in the hospital . You do realize that we have footage of you pawning Chili 's earring using a fake name ... whack him in the ribs using your boom pole , too ? No , no , it was n't like that . Chili and I were at some bar , and he wanted to ... " take the party up a notch . " So he gave me his earring and ... told me to pawn it and buy him some crank . Oh . And you thought , what a good idea ! He was my boss , so yeah . I could n't find any . I texted Chili , told him , but he never texted me back . So you kept the money . Yeah . And kept my mouth shut . It would n't have looked too good after he died . Yeah , no , you 're right . And it still does n't . Hey . You , uh , located the Spicemobile ? Huh ? No , no , not yet . Why ? Oh . Well , you could n't wait to see me , so I figured you were knee-deep in particulates . What ? ! Oh , my God . Yeah . Oh , my God ! Is this really happening ? Yes . And I do n't know why I 'm so excited , because it 's not like I 've never been rich before . Well , yeah , but that was family money - - this is the first time you 're rich because of something you did , alone . Yeah . Yeah . The hard thing now , though , is , like ... I mean , I just , I got to figure out how to tell Cam . Tell Cam what ? Uh ... Ijustheardback from the hospital in Philly-- Morton 's story checks out . So the mother really is sick ? Yep . He 's telling the truth . Maybe . Yup . That 's the jerk who gave me the black eye . Wait a second , you and Chili fought ? About 20 minutes after his friend left . I mean , that Chili guy was hammered . You do realize that according to Chili 's colleague , your bar was the last place Chili was seen alive ? Hey , look , I do n't know nothing about no murder . Last time I seen that fool , I was kicking his ass out the door , just like I do all the obnoxious drunks . So in other words , you ... you let a customer who was completely intoxicated get behind the wheel of a car ? I took his keys - - that 's when the fight started . That 's how I ended up with this . Right . You guys were fighting outside ... I was trying to help the dude . He decked me - - that 's when he took his keys back and he drove off . Any idea where he went ? No clue . At that point , I was just happy to see him go . You remember the honeycomb-structured ultra rubber covering that I was working on ? Um , I sold it . Oh , c-congratulations . For ... $2 million . That is just the advance . Sorry . So , I just wanted to make sure , you know , that there were no hard feelings ... Wait , wait , wait . If I had let you test that in the lab , most of that money would 've gone to the Jeffersonian ? Uh , legally , yes . Oh , my God . You're-you 're pissed . Why ? I followed every rule , every protocol , and for once I 'm not the bad guy ... this is ... It 's wonderful ! Gee . I wish we could go out and celebrate , you guys paying , of course , but we-we 've got a case . Right . And I got the results from the test on his hair follicles . It turns out Chili did have a crank habit , but there 's no evidence he used the day he was murdered . Well , if Chili wanted crank and Morton did n't get it for him , then maybe he just went and got it for himself . I found abrasions on Chili 's right metacarpals and second , third , and fourth proximal phalanges . That would be consistent with the bartender 's description of the fight . Yes . But I would prefer that we find evidence that points to something we do n't know . We will . We are quite a team , Clark . Yes . We are . Temperance . Hmm . I thought you could n't bring yourself to use mine . Yeah , I gave it a shot . I got to tell you , it hurt a little bit , but ... it made it easier for me , to , um , give you this . I could n't get the idea of your song out of my head , so I jotted down a few words for you . " From the incus to the coccyx , the stapes " to the talus , you better watch your ethmoid and vomer when you 're driving top down in Dallas . " Hmm , very clever . Well , thank you . You know ... you know , if you have any more ideas that you want for your song , you know , um , we 're quite the team , I 've been told . I would welcome your help . Thank you . You 're welcome . Hey . From the amount of remodeling , these injuries are at least three weeks old . So it seems that Chili had been in more than one fight recently . Because he did n't behave decently . He plays the nice guy facetiously . Get it . Get it , Dr . Brennan . Get ... Perhaps one song at a time . Yeah . Of course . Dr . Ed ... Dr . Edison , uh , can I have a word with you ? Oh . Yes , Dr . Saroyan . " Hungry , sleep-deprived , and in need of a shower . But otherwise , all is well . Miss you . Love , Arastoo . " So , this e-mail worries you why ? Wh-What if he 's been arrested and this is some kind of code ? Starvation and sleep deprivation are very common forms of torture . Oh , okay . But so is being hungry and tired because you 're in the hospital all day with your dying brother . Yeah , okay . That 's because it 's the middle of the night there . You think I 'm making too much of this , do n't you ? No , those are your words , not mine . I j ... I was fine . I really was . And then all of a sudden this wave of worry comes over me and I am just ... I am convinced that something horrible has happened to him . I ca n't stop it . Okay . Okay , look , it 's understandable . You 're so used to controlling things , and you just ca n't in this case . So now I 'm a control freak ? What ? - No . No , no . I 'm not ... - First of all , I did n't say " freak . " No , no ... We're-we 're good . Thank you . We 're done . You know , this is n't my fault , Dr . Saroyan . I 'm sorry . I ... I guess I'm_I 'm ... just ... looking for a reason why all this is happening . Something that ... something that would satisfy a control freak . But ... if you 'll just be honest with me if you hear anything ... Dr . Saroyan I 'm a very bad liar . I think that 's why Arastoo chose me to reassure you . I just wish I had done a better job . Wow , this neighborhood is horrible , is n't it ? Uh , yeah . So why the smile , Doc ? In the field . Gives me a rush . It 's like I 'm taking my life into my own hands . Well , I 'm not sure you 're taking your life in your hands . I mean , I 'm armed , there are cops here . Just saying , I 'm not intimidated . Booth knows that . Which is why he said , " You take him , Aubrey . I 'll stay here . " Exactly . I ca n't believe that I am actually seeing the Spicemobile in person . Oh . And smelling it . Yeah , this place is ripe . It 's pretty disappointing to find out your hero 's a total slob . Eh , I disagree . There are no particulates as good as slob particulates . At least he added a navigation system . If Angela can tell us where Chili drove over the past week , it might lead us to his killer . Oh , wow . This slob makes pigs look dainty . All right , you know what , we 're just gon na take the entire van back to the lab . I 'll bet this was delicious once . Aubrey , please do n't eat that . Bones . Hey . Booth , what are you doing here ? Well , I was doing some digging into , uh , Chili Reuben 's shoulder injury , and it turns out he was in Memphis in the emergency room three weeks ago . But you could 've just told me this on the phone . I got you this . Booth . Oh , it 's beautiful . Like it ? Love it . Yeah . Let me help you ... put it on . Here you go . Thanks . Okay . Kind of resembles a humerus bone , right ? Well , if you curved it , I suppose . How does it look ? Like I made the right choice . It is quite exquisite . I was ... talking about you . I made the right choice . I 'm just so lucky to have you as my wife . I have something for you , too . For me ? Well , what are you doing with my gambling sobriety chip ? I found it in the laundry . I must have left it in my pocket . It 's not like you , Booth . You always know where your chip is . Well , you know what , I know where it is now because of you .C . It turns out on four of the six days Chili was in town , he left the diners he was reviewing to drive to more respectable restaurants . And he did the same thing in other cities . Sounds like the King of the Greasy Spoon did n't practice what he preached . And I downloaded his calendar from the cloud . These are the people he ate with . Who are they ? Reality TV show producers . I thought he already had a producer . Looks like he wanted to get rid of him . Why would I kill him ? Without Chili , I do n't have a show . Chili was firing you from the show that you two created together . Okay ? Logic goes out the window when you 're in a rage , Sid . I-I had no idea that that disloyal bastard was planning to replace me .R . Then three weeks later , you decided to finish him off . Chili went to the hospital in Memphis because he jumped out of a moving car when I tried to take him to rehab . Rehab ? Yeah . I mean , this guy , he was seriously screwed up . Between the-the drinking and-and the drugs and all the one-night stands , do you know how many waitresses I had to pay off so they would n't leak their stories to the tabloids ? So what are you still doing in town then , Sid ? I mean , if Chili 's gone , there 's no more show , is there ? Well , the network is , uh ... is forcing me to finish the episode without him . Uh , they expect the ratings to go through the roof now that he 's dead . Oh , that 's interesting . Well , it could belong to Chili or to his killer . Wow . It is n't gon na be easy to find evidence of a struggle in this mess . I can not believe that anyone would treat such a fantastic vehicle like a rolling Roman food orgy . Uh , that orgy may not have been exclusively for food . We have body fluids . Ew . Well , if the van 's a-rockin ' ... Yep . And judging from the amount of hydration , they 're fairly recent . Do you smell something ? Yeah , I 'm trying not to . I do n't know . It 's something floral . But that could be a good thing for us . Yeah . If I can actually get an air sample and run it through the gas chromatograph , I should be able to isolate the smell and reformulate it chemically . Okay . Brennan , I 've already examined the skull . Yes , but based on the defensive wounds we found earlier , I decided to take another look , and I found something very interesting . There 's a crescent-shaped bruise on the occipital . How did we miss this ? Well , it 's likely we did n't notice it before because it was hidden under Chili 's hair plug scars . I 'd like to take another look at the X-rays of our skull . You seem agitated , Dr . Edison . Well , no , " frustrated " is more accurate . We 've only used 187 bones in the song so far , and I 'm having second thoughts about rhyming " calcaneus " with " malleus . " It 's ... Anxiety is a perfectly normal physiological response to the vulnerability that comes with engaging in a creative endeavor . Oh , that 's good to know . Look . I knew I saw something . There 's a tiny missing fragment on the occipital . Something must have hit him there . Yes , but still , if we found the implement that was used to make this , it could lead us to our killer . So I isolated all the aromas that were n't food-based into their own individual compounds , which I then reformulated into a condensed , more intensified version . Look , before you turn on the Smell-O-Vision , Dr . Hodgins , I just want to thank you both for being here today . Uh ... it 's kind of our job . I realize that , but anyone else who got a check for $2 million probably would have taken the day off . Oh . Yeah , I guess that 's true . I ... I did n't even think about that . Which is why I said thank you . I hope I have n't given you any ideas . No . No . No , no . Look , first of all , we know how quickly it can disappear , and we love our jobs , so ... sniffers ready ... This is gon na be tough , but ... It 's perfume . I 'd recognize that perfume anywhere . It 's JoAnne . Uh , who 's JoAnne ? JoAnne 's the waitress at the Royal Diner . She never mentioned that her and Chili got personal . In the back of the Spicemobile , no less . Based on the injuries to the side of Chili 's head , I 'm not so sure that that encounter was consensual . There was no assault . Chili and I hooked up in the back of his Spicemobile . Consensually . I 'm not proud of it , but last I checked , it 's not a crime . No , but lying to the FBI is . I did n't want Frankie to know that I slept with the guy who was about to trash our diner on national TV . Hey , look , maybe you just got angry at Chili because he used you for sex , so you ... The only way I could have injured him was with a partial disruption of his posterior sacroiliac complex . If you know what I 'm saying . Why is she talking like you ? It means an injury caused by excessive movement of the pelvis during sex . Nicely described , JoAnne . Thank you . Look , I mean ... just one of those things . It was a ... quickie in the back of a van . It was nice to feel like a kid again . And what happened after that ? Nothing . He took off in the van . That 's the last I 've seen of him . Look , you know what ? If we 're done here , I need to go back to work . I do make most of my living on tips . Oh , hold on . I got a tip for you . I would n't think about leaving town . I may have to talk to you again . You can forget about your free refills ... ? Very nice , Dr . Brennan . I had no idea you were so talented . Oh . Yes . Sometimes I surprise myself . Right . Well , I got the test results from the blood in the back of the van . It is n't JoAnne 's , and it is n't Chili 's , either . Well , it could still belong to the killer . Not unless Chili was murdered by a double cheeseburger . Turns out it 's beef blood . Oh . I was hoping for more of a clue . We all were . Dr . Brennan , can I ask you a question ? Oh . If I can sing while inspecting the bones , I can certainly converse . Do you think ... do you think Arastoo did n't ask me to go to Iran with him because I 've been so noncommittal about the whole marriage thing ? I imagine everyone is telling you that he 'll be fine over there . Yeah , but I ... If you were with him , you would have been in danger , too . He knew that . Wow . Thanks for ... not holding back . Arastoo loves you , Cam . Whether or not you marry him . That 's why he did n't want you to ... go with him . I would have done the same thing . So would I . Then you should feel better . I do . Yes . Thank you . Dr . Brennan asked me to take another look at the X-rays of the skull . I think I might have found something . Now , it 's pretty small , but there appears to be evidence of hemorrhagic staining on the tympanomastoid . Maybe you could swab it . Yeah . It 's the ear canal , right ? Well , technically , it 's the bone surrounding it . But you know what the strange thing is ? Chili showed no sign of cerebrovascular trauma . Forensically , drowning has no diagnostic features . And Chili 's lung tissue was too damaged by the corrosives to show evidence of excessive fluid . Plus ... this crescent-shaped bruise to the occipital is the same size and shape of a sink faucet . If Chili was killed at the diner , then the particulates and missing fragment may still be in the drain catch . Oh , yeah . So , according to Chili 's injuries , the killer pushed him against the edge of the sink , causing the line of fractures along the lower ribs . Then , when Chili tried to raise his head to gasp for air , he banged his head on the faucet , bruising his occipital . If that graphic is accurate , the faucet at the diner looks too small to have left that mark on his head . Yeah , you 're right . Well , I reexamined Chili 's lung tissue , and I found evidence of glycerin , sodium sulfate , hydrolyzed vegetable protein ... Wait , that sounds more like soap . Yeah . It does . Which would explain the foreign epithelial cells I found that were n't a match for Chili 's . Pull up the Web site of the motel Chili was staying at . There 's got to be pictures of the rooms . Okay , here , let 's take a look at the bathtub . Now , without exact measurements , it 's hard to be certain , but the bruise on Chili 's skull seems to be a match to that faucet . And I 'm guessing his rib fractures line up , too . - Sure looks like it . - Wait a minute . But I thought the FBI combed through Chili 's room and found no evidence of foul play . But the entire crew was staying at that motel . Chili could have been killed in someone else 's room . Except that it was because - - you know why ? Your mother is in the hospital right now dying of kidney failure . Records show that she spent two years on the transplant list waiting for a kidney that never showed up . What , and Chili just walks in and gets two organ transplants and he still abuses himself ? It was like him giving your mother the finger . We found a fragment of Chili 's skull inside your bathtub drain . And we found your epithelial cells inside Chili 's lungs . We know you did it , man . I did n't mean to kill him . I swear . He shows up drunk . I 'm in the bath . He 's screaming about how I could n't score any crank for him . And then he starts ransacking my bathroom , looking for pills . Yeah , but that only made him crazier . Then he starts swinging at me . I ... I-I could n't take it anymore . I held him underwater to shut him up . Then you just dumped the body and went to go see your mom . Yeah . I did n't know what else to do . Whoa . Wow , this place is packed . Probably because of all the publicity from our case . There 's Frankie right over there . Hey , my three favorite customers . I saved your table for you . Look at that , huh ? You sure you 're not still mad at us ? Are you kidding me ? Business is better than ever . Enjoy . Thanks . Can we sing Daddy the song while we wait ? Whoa . What , here ? Wait a second . What song ? " The Bone Song . " The real one . " The Bone Song " ? Wait a second . One , two , three ... ? The tibia , fibula , femur and patella . If the shoe fits your metatarsals . Then you might be Cinderella . So get off your sacrum . Get off your coccyx . Wave your triquetrum and capitate . In the air . Shake your cuneiform . And navicular . Like you just do n't care . ? Wow . You guys can rap . Now it 's your turn , Daddy . No , no , no , I do n't rap . Please , Daddy ! Come on , Daddy . Do n't be a spoilsport . Okay . Here we go . ? The mandible and palatine . The lacrimal and malleus ..... round of milk shakes , huh . Chocolate and vanilla , leave a mess on my maxilla . ? Good one , Christine . ? I 'll make sure . That I do n't twist my cuneiform . ' Cause I just might get soda on my uniform . ? Huh ? Ah , it 's gon na be a long night . Yep . More singing , Daddy . ? Clavicle , clavicle . Watch out ' cause Daddy 's gon na tickle your left . Schmavicle , schmavicle . ? No , that 's not anatomically accurate , Booth . I know , Bones , but you better be careful , or I 'm gon na tickle your schmavicle . No , I 've had enough of that . == sync , corrected by elderman == @elderman 
@@5239141 Hi . And welcome back to our Tool Time salute ... Ohhhhhh ! ... to golf . Let 's get to it . We have a very special guest for you . That 's right . He 's number eight in all-time earnings on the PGA tour . He 's in town at the Golf Expo . Let 's give a warm Tool Time welcome to Payne Stewart . Thanks for making time to be on the show . You know ... You 'd think with the kind of cash you 're pulling down , you could afford the rest of those trousers . Tim , when you 're in the public eye , you have to have a trademark . With me , it 's knickers . With you , it 's burns and abrasions . Well , Mr . Stewart , first things first . How does one go about choosing the right driver ? - Well , it depends on your ability . - OK . - Now , what 's your handicap , Al ? - Tim . Actually , it 's 16 . - All right . Tim , what 's your handicap ? Payne , Payne , Payne ... What 's a handicap ? I think golf is more of a Zen-like , jujitsu type of thing . His handicap is 35 . You guys think you 're so good ? Why do n't we take a shot at my golf simulator and have a driving contest ? Klaus ! Now , the way that this machine works is there are sensors in the pad which measure the velocity and the striking angle of the club . The vector and the velocity is then measured ... Al , shut up and shoot the thing , will you ? Vector velocities . Ninety-five yards . Nice shot , miss . All right , Payne . Let 's see what you got . See what we can come up with here . Two hundred-ninety-one yards . Nice drive . Wow . That was a great drive . Well , I guess this contest is over . Not so fast . - And what would this be ? - I know what this is . This is a special driver designed for senior citizens to get more distance . They do n't even have to swing it because it 's got 25 caliber charge in it . Not anymore . I bored it out to a 44 magnum . - That 's cheating . - Welcome to my world . Stand back , guys . All right . Fire in the hole . You the man . Where are you going in that shirt ? Well , it 's happy hour at The Tiki Hut . You got ta get there by five o'clock , or the pupu platter is picked clean . Do you actually meet women there ? Or just go there to pig out on pupu ? Well , I have n't met anyone yet . But I 'm forming a social network of people with similar interests . People who eat dinner off toothpicks in the middle of the afternoon . It 's a lot of fun . But Jill 's got the flu and I 'm stopping by the pharmacy to pick up medication . Anything you suggest ? These days I 'm strictly homeopathic . No wonder you 're not meeting any women . If that 's how you feel , fine . Goodnight , Al . Goodnight , Tim . - Heidi , is anything wrong ? - No , nothing . Are you sure ? Well , actually , Scott and I have separated . He moved out a couple weeks ago . Heidi , I 'm so sorry . Why did n't you say something about this before ? Because I did n't want to bring my personal problems to work . Why not ? Because you said , " Do n't ever bring your personal problems to work . " Since when do you listen to me ? Since you said , " I had better start listening to you . " Nice going , Mr . Compassion . I might need a little time off from the show . He 's got her this week . We ca n't leave Heidi alone when she 's this upset . Take her to the Tiki Hut . Well , nothing raises one 's spirits like a fistful of pot stickers . She does n't need food . She needs a shoulder to cry on , OK ? Well , I 'm not exactly an expert on relationships , Tim . But you 're a good friend and you 're a good listener . Come on , do it for Heidi . - Do it for the show . - For the show ? If she 's too upset to come back , you 'll have to squeeze into one of the skirts . - Here you go , Mom . - Oh , thank you , sweetie . What are you doing with all these mail-order catalogs ? Now that I 'm sick , I finally have time to look through them . You got ta see this . " The World 's Best Earwax Removal System " . All right , off we go . Yeah . We 're going to the mall to pick up some CD 's . You know what ? I 'll go with you . Wait a minute . You do n't have to go anywhere . I 've got a music catalog that 'll save you money . Look at this . Fifteen CD 's for a penny . Well , it sounds great . But who 's Pat Boone ? - We 'll be home before dinner . - OK . - Hey , guys . - Hello , Dad . Well , honey , how are you feeling ? How do I look ? That 's what I thought . - Help is on the way . Look what I got . - Oh . Ibuprofen . I got antihistamines . I got decongestants , analgesics . I got daytime decongestant . I 've got nighttime decongestant . You take two of everything here and that flu 'll be out of your system in an hour . - Heidi 's marriage is in trouble . - What ? - Yeah . She and Scott are separated . - Oh , my God . That 's terrible . Apparently , it has n't been good for quite a while . Oh , no . I have to call her . She probably wants a woman to talk to . It 's all taken care of . She 's having dinner with Al . That 's a good question . The show 's about to begin . Enjoy yourselves . - Heidi ? - Hi , Tim . I thought you needed time off . I did , too . But then I had dinner with Al . - He put everything in perspective . - You and Scott getting back together ? I do n't know . But I 've made it over this first hurdle . Al really helped me get in touch with my rage . Hm . No one brings out rage better than Al . But it did a lot of good . Well , last night was pretty incredible for me , too , you know . We talked about everything from the weather to intimate details of her life . Forget the weather . How about the other stuff ? Well , basically , you know , after Amy was born , Heidi did n't feel very sexual . Scott wasn't understanding and that turned Heidi off to sex even more . - So they 're not ... uh ... - No . No . Not for a while . Huh . But before the baby , Oh , my God ! What ? What ? Well , I 've already said too much . I do n't want to betray Heidi 's confidence . - I can respect that . - OK . Now , I could guess some things . If I 'm real close , you could just nod . Everybody know what time it is ? Tool Time ! That 's right . Woo-hoo ! Good morning . Good morning . Wait a minute . Hold on . Something 's different . Let me guess . You did something with your hair , did n't you ? It 's a sinus mask . OK ? But if it does n't work , it 's totally returnable . I 'd love to be the second owner of that thing . Before you waste more money , Al 's got a bunch of homoerotic remedies . Why do n't I call him ? Speaking of work , how 's Heidi doing ? Very well , thanks to Al . And he 's really taking care of her problems . Heidi must be grateful to have a friend like Al . Stay in the shower , Al . I got it . Good morning . Borland residence . Uh , wrong number . Bye-bye . - Who was it ? - It sounded like one of the Muppets . Oh , God . Oh , God . I 've got this image of Al and Heidi . Get out of my head ! Get out of my head ! Heidi did not sleep with Al . First of all , she 's a married woman . And second of all , she , she would n't go for a guy like Al . Her husband is tall and handsome . I mean , he spends more time at the gym than Al does at Hickory Farms . Honey , I 'm not saying that it happened . But I could understand how a woman like Heidi could fall for a guy like Al . In what universe ? Women like Heidi have had the gorgeous hunks . The second time around , they want somebody less exciting , more dependable . Me ... I went for number two first . You do n't understand . You do not understand . Al is like a dependable four-door Rambler and Heidi like a twelve-cylinder Ferrari . They do n't belong in the same garage . Oh , Tim . Look , even if they were parked in the same garage , you are not their mechanic . You 're just being petty . Oh , I 'm being petty ? Yeah . Why should you be the only one with an incredibly desirable woman ? - Hi , Al . - Hey . Hey , would you help me put my tool belt on ? I just touched up my nails . - Okey-dokey . - Thank you . - Hey . - Yeah ? I just want to tell you how wonderful it 's been for me these past few days . Well , it 's been pretty incredible for me , too . You 're really a special lady . Thanks . You have a good show . - You , too . - OK . - Morning , Tim . - Is it ? Hey ! How are you doing , buddy ? Good . Uh-huh . Well , anyway , Jill and I got to talking and we were thinking that maybe you and Heidi were ... What ? You know . Even though I told her that a Rambler could n't jump-start a Ferrari . But , you know ... So you 're saying it would be impossible for Heidi to be interested in Al ? No . I do n't believe it . But other people are talking . Well , those other people can think what they want . Amen . Amen . But , uh , would those other people be right or would they be wrong ? Well , Tim , are you asking me to talk about my personal life at work ? Yes . I think it 's about time we opened up and shared our experiences . OK . I , uh , I actually have something I 'd like to share . Let it go . Do n't hold anything back . The truth is , Heidi and I ... Yeah ? Yeah ? ... are entitled to our privacy . It shreds , decontaminates , and deodorizes . I wonder if it would work on your meatloaf . I 'll be back in about an hour . All right ? Where are you going ? I 'm gon na go over to Al 's house and do some repairs . - Dad , it 's ten o'clock at night . - I 'm a conscientious landlord , son . The same landlord who said , " Al , do you really need heat in February ? " What are you gon na fix with these binoculars ? That is such an insulting question I 'm not even gon na answer it . You have sunk this low . You 're gon na go spy on poor Al . I just do n't want him hurt . I 'm gon na need those back . No . Forget about it . You 're not going there . There 's nothing wrong with being curious . You are not curious ; you 're obsessed . I 'm not obsessed . It 's torture having this image filling up my brain . Especially with space at such a premium . Ooh . Something smells good out here , Wilson . What are you doing ? I 'm boiling up some sap for the Michigan Maple Festival . Speaking of saps , wait till you hear what Al 's been doing . You do n't have to tell me . I 've heard all about it . What ? What Al told me is in strictest confidence . - Well , you know , Wilson ... - Mm-hm ? ... I could get you a riding mower from Binford . Sixteen-horse rear-bagger for cost plus ten . Sorry , neighbor . I ca n't be bought . Why would Al tell you and not me ? Well , maybe because I did n't search his locker for long brown hairs . Which , according to the lab , either belonged to a collie or Al 's mother . And I 've never asked Heidi about hers . But you put the two of them together ... There 's that image again . Tim , have you ever heard of the term " cognitive dissonance ? " You know I 'm not into politics . Cognitive dissonance is when pieces of our lives no longer make sense . Beliefs we always held true seem to be false so we reorder our way of thinking . Are you saying a Rambler could hook bumpers with a Ferrari ? It 's very possible . No , no . If what you say is true then everything I believe is false . - Now , Tim . That 's not necessarily ... - Let me go with this for a minute . OK ? This means that maybe cars are n't the most important thing in the world . - Ohh ... - No , wait a minute . Opera 's more manly than football ? - Neighbor ... - Al 's mother is thin ? Tim , it 's not easy to change one 's perceptions . OK , Wilson . How far does this go ? How do I really know you are who I think you are ? - How do I know you 're who I think ? - How do I know you said that ? - How do I know you heard ? - How do I know you 're here ? Who else would have the time to come out and listen to this silly conversation ? Hey , Al . Can I talk to you for a minute ? I do n't think so . I 'm not gon na feed your appetite for lurid gossip and tawdry innuendo . And , by the way , I installed an alarm on my locker . I should n't have gotten involved in your personal life . From now on , your business is your business , all right ? Well , I appreciate that . If there 's any other part of my life you want to talk about , I 'm an open book . I 'm not much of a reader . Thanks . - How are ya ? - Oh , I feel so great this morning . - Oh , I feel pretty great myself . How about Sorentino 's for dinner tonight ? All week long it 's " Fettuccine Madness " ! - I 'm afraid I ca n't make it . - Why not ? Well , thanks to the things you said , I saw Scott last night . And we 're gon na get back together . Is n't that great ? Oh , that 's so great ! Yes , that 's ... Good for you ! - Thanks . I got you a something . - You did n't have to do that . - I wanted to . Here . - Oh , thank you . I also want to thank you for letting me sleep on your hide-a-bed . Well , now I call it the Heidi-bed . Good . Oh , it 's The Tiki Hut Cookbook ! - Do you like it ? - I love this ! Now I can make pupu at home ... Uh , Heidi ... Uh ... can I just talk to you about one thing ? Sure . What ? Well , after that night you stayed at my house , Tim got this crazy idea that , that you and I might have ... How do I say this ? - Slept together . - Yeah . OK . Yeah , that 's it . And he thought that was impossible because he does n't think a beautiful woman like you could ever be interested in , in a guy like me . Oh , is that so ? Well , let me tell you something , Al . If I weren't married , you 're exactly the type of guy I 'd be looking for . Thank you . I wish , I wish Tim could hear you say that . You know , I do n't think Tim really needs to hear anything . - Howdy , Wilson . - Hidy-ho . Not hidy-ho . Let 's talk Heidi-Al . She just drove it home . - Tim . - Yeah ? Get a hobby . Good-night . I think you 're right about what you said yesterday . Nothing 's right with me . I think I am suffering from communist discotheque . Tim , can we chat about this tomorrow ? I am a little busy . Wilson , where do you keep a copy of Lady Chatterley 's Lover ? I got ta get some new friends . You 'd think with all the money you pull down you could afford the rest of those pantaloonies ... You 'd think with the money you make ... I have ... I have ... I have ... I have to say the word " culottes " just once . You do n't want to be the only one with a desirable woman . 
@@5239241 It just made sense to move in to my grandmother 's house . She wanted to re-create for our daughter the happy memories she had in this house . I was stunned to see Amelia sitting up in bed . Who is she talking to ? I know I heard somebody , but there 's nobody there . Something was wrong in our house . I could feel awful , searing hatred . Who 's there ? Something paranormal was in our house , but I never would have thought a member of my own family would be trying to harm me . Chris ! Chris ! She 's back ! I grew up in a small city about 20 minutes east of L.A . called Whittier . I spent a lot of my time with my grandmother . She lived down the street from us . Hi , grandma . I 'd come in , and she 'd say ... How are you , sugar pie ? What you up to ? Not much . Ooh , what are we making today ? Your favorite pie . I loved my grandmother dearly ... And loving and inviting . What do you think ? Sorry , grandma . Got to go . Do n't you want some pie ? I met Chris in July of 2008 . Chris loved life . He had no fear about him and such strong confidence . Bye , grandma ! The common cliche ... It was just love at first sight . The minute I laid eyes on her , I knew she was the one . Chris and I got very serious very quickly . But my happiness was cut short . My grandma had a stroke . And our family decided that she needed round-the-clock care that we could n't provide , so she had to go to a hospice facility . Chris and I spent as much time as we could visiting her and trying to keep her spirits up . What can I do for you , grandma ? There was a day that she was really down and depressed . And she asked for her favorite blanket . The one grandpa got me ... It 's on my bed . Before Chris left , I told him ... Just go in through the back door . It 's always open . Chris works security , so he gave me a puzzled look . And I said , " she comes from the generation " where you leave your doors and your windows unlocked and open . " Sure enough , the door was open like they said . It was a creepy , dark house . And there 's all kind of antiques and sort that she had collected over the years . Damn it . All of a sudden , I got this really strange feeling , almost like somebody 's following me . I do n't see anything , so I shrug it off and think , " it 's just my imagination . Snap out of it . " I go into her bedroom ... And see her blanket sitting there . I still feel this heaviness about me . I 'm a big guy . When I got back to the hospital , I guess obviously I looked like something was bothering me . What 's the matter ? What happened ? Nothing . I do n't know . It just seemed like there was somebody in the house . But obviously , there was nobody there . Mr . Security . I thought Chris was just reading too much into it . You 're my hero . My grandmother passed away . I was completely devastated . This was someone who I had spent so much of my life with , someone who raised me , and my best friend , and now she 's gone . Chris and I got married . We had a baby girl , and we named her Amelia . It just made sense for us to move in to my grandmother 's old house . The price was right . The house was a perfect size . It had a backyard . It made me feel closer to my grandmother , almost as if still a part of her was with me . There was a lot of unpacking to do , getting rid of old stuff that was in the house . Wait . It 's my guardian angel . We did n't get to all of it . We just kind of took a couple of boxes of paperwork , shoved them in the den closet . It 's nothing that 's that important . We hung pictures in our hallway of family : His family , my family , past generations . Mementos of , like , people that had passed on or ... That we can see every time we walk through the hallway . - Well ? - It looks great . See what your man did for you ? " Rocky , I 'm afraid this joke may get Zeke in a whole mess of trouble . " Amelia had her own room . " Rocky laughed . " To find his first crowd of customers . " It gave me such a warm feeling . " They 're going to expect a ghost . Zeke has n't got anything but a rock and an old board . " " They 'll just run him over to jail . " It brought back memories of me when I was a little girl with my grandmother in the house . " After all , it was his mischief that started all this foolishness . " A few days later , we had put Amelia to bed . And welcome to Fact or Fiction . - I 'm your host ... - I glanced over at the monitor . And I was stunned to see Amelia sitting up in bed . Welcome to our champion , bunny . She was having a conversation with someone . It 's my daddy . As you know , bunny has won ... $17,380 dollars so far . Chris . Look at this . Here 's our child sitting up in bed having a full conversation ... With nothing . And then I hear another voice ... Almost like a really faint ... But you could hear it ... Woman 's voice . And I 'm kind of like weirded out , like , " what 's ... what the hell 's going on in here ? " Like , " am I just ... Am I hearing things ? " Who is that ? I start to freak out and , like , wonder , " who 's ... who 's in her room ? Did somebody break in ? " I go over , and I start checking the windows to make sure that they 're locked and make sure nobody 's in there . Who you talking to , sweetie ? To my friend . Who 's your friend ? She shut down , did n't want to talk about it . For her to want to keep a secret was very unusual . Okay . Good night . Good night . One night , Chris had gone to work . I went to take my contacts out , get ready for bed . I heard a very small , very light knock on the bathroom door . I thought , " meh . " Tried to brush it off . It sounded like a fist had pounded the door ... Very forceful bang , very loud . I 'm home alone with my young child . I needed to check on her . I reached out , kind of shaking . I felt blind . Everything was blurry . There was no one outside the door . My daughter was looking very happy and peaceful in her bed . I heard what sounded like footsteps on the roof . The thing that really scared me was that somebody could be trying to break into our house . What would anybody want with us in our house ? I called my husband immediately . I was talking probably a mile a minute . - Come home right now . Just sit tight . When I get home , I grab my flashlight . And it 's so heavy , I can double it up as a weapon if I need to . Stay here . I 'm gon na go check outside . I walk down the run behind our bedroom and do n't see anything . It was dead quiet . But we 're just east of L.A . , so there is always that possibility that we could have a break-in or anything of that nature . But there was nothing out there . So I kind of just said , you know , " hey , honey , " and just reassured her . Maybe she 's hearing new creaks and cracks of an old house . Smooch ! I was n't sure what it was , but there was something threatening about the house . This was not the safe place that I remembered from my childhood . Chris is working a lot , and it was wonderful to have him home . And Amelia was having fun playing with her toys . It seemed like a perfect evening . Holy crap . What was that ? What ? I saw this figure , like a black , shadowy figure , like , pass by the kitchen , and then it was gone . You did n't see that ? His face got really serious . You guys stay there . I 'm just gon na go inside for a second . I went into my room and grabbed my gun from the safe . I knew it was fully loaded . My heart 's racing , ' cause , you know , at any given moment , I can turn the corner and kind of see somebody . Amelia , come here . Come on . I feel like somebody 's on my heels ... Like a heavy weight on me . I had heard a creaking noise coming from the kitchen . Is everything okay ? Yeah , it 's nothing . I thought I saw something . But ... it 's nothing . I was n't convinced . I know that if he thinks he saw something and he went to investigate it , there 's a reason behind it . He saw something , and he just was n't telling me . Later that evening , Chris had gone to work . I was trying to just relax and finish up some housework . I hear tapping on the window ... As if fingernails were tapping . Nothing there , absolutely nothing . I hear this scratching on the outside of the house . The hair on my arms stood up . It sounded like the living room door slammed shut . I stood there really not wanting to go see what it was . Another bang ... The kitchen door ... The den door ... And then another ... And another ... And then another . They did n't actually close . They just made the noise . I felt something grip my shoulder . After what I had just experienced , I knew something was happening . Something paranormal was in our house . There 's definitely something or someone connected to this house . I was searching for any kind of reason as to what was happening to us . I started to think , " could it be somehow connected to my grandmother ? " Available 3.6 liter v6 makes 295 . In terms of fuel economy , Chrysler 's boasting up to ... Is grandma still here ? Maybe we had done something to upset her . What do you mean " here " ? This was her house for so long . What the ... Stay there . Amanda , you have to come see this . I could n't believe what I was looking at . This one picture came off the wall and landed in a very unnatural way . We were both completely at a loss . The nail 's still good . I started to wonder , " maybe we should have moved somewhere else . " Maybe we should have moved somewhere to start fresh that neither one of us had any memories from . " Hey , Chris ? Hey , Kevin . My boss asked me , " hey , you know " ... What 's going on ? I told him , you know , " I have some weird things going on in the house , a lot of things that I ca n't explain . " Neither of us can . Like what ? Like fingernails scratching at the window , footsteps down the hall . And he said , you know , " well , maybe I can help you with that . " My wife , Lisa , she 's a psychic . I was dumbfounded , ' cause I did n't really so much as buy into , you know , psychics and mediums and things of that nature . Amanda , she 's frightened . We were desperate at this point . " Okay . I 'm a psychic medium . I specialize in exorcisms and cleansings . I 've been gifted since about four years of age . Hi , Amanda ? I 'm Lisa . I did n't know what a psychic was except for the silly things you see on TV , and I did n't really know what to think , but I knew we needed something . They were a very sweet young couple . I could tell immediately they were very s they really needed help , and I really wanted to help them . She moved through the house as if she was taking photographs with her eyes and just kind of making observations . As I walked around the home , a pulse in my hand began to start . It got stronger and stronger , and it was leading me around . I got this very strong sense of history . Have you been living here long ? No , just a few months . Well , that 's strange . It was really odd , because we had n't given her any information . I was heading towards Amelia 's room . My hand started having a pulse . It 's like a Geiger counter . I was drawn to her little bed . And I pointed to a spot on the ground . Does she talk to someone there ? I froze for a second . Yes . I remembered Amelia sitting up in bed having a conversation with someone we could n't see . All of a sudden , I could hear talking . I can hear her now . The presence was in the room with us . I could hear talking . I can hear her now . The presence was in the room with us . She 's very kind . " He said , ' I 'll just put this ' " ... I like her presence . You could feel this good presence , and it was a very gentle , very kind , very nurturing voice . " When she turned to leave the room , I heard Lisa say something . That started all this " ... Sugar pie . Sugar pie . My heart stopped . What did you say ? Sugar pie . I got very emotional . It 's my grandma . That 's what she called me . It was a wonderful feeling inside to think that this woman was now protecting my child . But it was very confusing . We had a guardian angel presence , but on the other hand , these terrible things had happened . The next room I went to was the den . You could feel this dark , horrible feeling . It was overwhelming . I was jolted and pushed back . I heard this very aggressive voice yelling and screaming . Get out of here ! Lisa . Stop . I could feel that she was trapped . I could hear it . She 's angry . Stop it ! She wanted out so desperately . She was literally in a hell . Lisa . Lisa ! I looked at my hands , and I swear they were bleeding . Scratching . She wanted me to feel the pain that she was going through . What is going on ? Lisa . I could feel a presence literally physically there . Lisa turned around and said , " you have human remains here . " Right behind my hand on this wall , there 's a box of human remains . In the closet . My jaw dropped . I could n't believe what I was hearing . I open up the closet door , and we have all sorts of boxes stored in there . No . She tells me , " keep looking . Keep going . " No . It 's that one , that one . It 's in there . This is it . It 's in there . My God . As soon as Chris took out the box , I realized what it was . Great-aunt Almarie . I looked over at my wife , and she looked back at me , and , you know , she understood . Like , she understood what Lisa was talking about . Not everybody knew that my grandma had a twin sister . She lived out in Las Vegas , so I only saw her maybe once or twice a year . She had very long fingernails . Stop fidgeting . She was a very stern person , very difficult . Everything had to be her way or no way . Take the picture . When my uncle passed away , my grandmother had to bring her sister back home to take care of her there . The whole time she was there , she made my grandma miserable and would be very nasty . Homemade chicken soup . I do n't want it . T so . I do n't want it . It was very upsetting seeing my grandmother being treated in such a mean way . Get out of here ! A few months after that , my great-aunt passed away . I tried to explain to them the gravity of the situation . You need to get rid of these ashes to protect this family . Her great-aunt blamed them for her being in that box . She 's just begging to be out , and no one 's listening , so her only recourse is aggression . She 'd do anything to get out of that box , anything . What is going on ? Lisa . I tried to explain to them the gravity of the situation . You need to get rid of these ashes to protect this family . Her great-aunt blamed them for her being in that box . If these remains were not removed , this family would never survive living there . Me and Amanda had talked about what to do with the ashes . I had figured that we 'd just leave them in the garage overnight , and then we would just figure out what to do with them in the morning . Ha-ha , that 's great , bunny . Thank you . Bunny , are you ready to meet that new challenger ? Yeah , I really am . Okay , bunny . Let 's bring in that new mystery challenger . Well , hello . - Hi . - And your name ? - My name 's Sable . - Sable . Sable ... I hear fingernails tapping on our window . They were , " tap , tap , tap . " Sable 's from Harlem . Is n't that wonderful ? I 'm gon na get me some money . So you can get out of Harlem , And you can see that she is very serious . All right , Sable , you know how our game is played . Yes . I watch it every day ... And I looked out the window . Absolutely nothing . I was completely petrified . I knew that my great-aunt was back . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Yeah , I get him back to the car ... Come on . Come on . Hey , babe . Chris ! Chris ! She 's back ! What ? Chris , come home , please ! Okay . I 'll be there as soon as I can . Just ... Amanda . Amanda . All of a sudden , the phone drops call . Chris ? And the phone went dead . I was terrified , completely terrified . I could feel the most evil , terrible feeling . I hear this ... The door had shut , almost as if somebody closed it . No . Amelia ! No ! The door would n't open . Trying to pull on the door and hit the door and kick the door . On the roof as if this spirit was trying to cave in my roof . Mommy ! Mommy ! No ! Amelia ! My daughter starts to cry , and I ca n't get out . I ca n't get to her . Mommy ! No . Amelia ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Amelia ! I hear what sounds like footsteps . Something was coming at me . Quick , Amelia ! I was petrified for Amelia . Mommy ! Mommy ! Leave my daughter alone ! Stop messing with my family ! I 'm just yelling at the top of my lungs , " leave my family alone . If you want to pick on somebody " ... Pick on me ! I 'm right here ! We had to do something . We had to get rid of these ashes . They had to go ... As far away from our house as possible . I knew what I wanted to do with my great-aunt 's ashes . I had a good idea of where I wanted to scatter her . She was always very happy at the casino . It was definitely a place that she loved to be . We just wanted this thing out of our house and wanted to move on with our lives . As her ashes were flying in the wind , you could feel the sense of relief . I did . I knew that now she would be at peace and be happy . When we arrived back home , there was such a sense of peace and calm in our house . Our house was no longer tormented by this negativity . My grandma had always looked out for me when I was little , and now it 's a great feeling knowing that my grandmother is also taking care of my daughter and my great-aunt was now at peace .

But we 're sure the things are related , the singing and dancing and burning and dying . We 're not sure of much ... she does n't seem to ... She 's easing back into it .

I 'm worried this session 's gon na turn into some training montage from an ' 80s movie . Yeah , I 'm pretty spry for a corpse . Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween ? Oh .

I 'd better help her out Cos she is drawn to the fire - Some people never learn - She will never learn And she will walk through the fire And let it ... Will this do a thing to change her ? Am I leaving Dawn in danger ? Is my slayer too far gone to care ? What if Buffy ca n't defeat it ? Beady-Eyes is right , we 're needed !

I ca n't kill you , you take me to Hellsville in her place . - What if I kill you ? - Trust me . Wo n't help . - That 's gloomy . - That 's life . Come , now , is that really what you feel ? Is n't life a miraculous thing ? I think you already know . Life 's a show And we all play our parts And when the music starts We open up our hearts It 's all right if some things come out wrong We 'll sing a happy song And you can sing along Where there 's life there 's hope Every day 's a gift Wishes can come true Whistle while you work So hard , all day To be like other girls To fit in in this glittering world Do n't give me songs - She needs backup ... Now that was a show-stopping number . Not quite the fireworks that I was looking for ... Get out of here . Mm , I smell power . I guess the little missus and I should be on our way . That 's never gon na happen . I do n't make the rules . She summoned me . I so did not . He keeps saying that . You have my talisman on , sweet thing . Oh , but , no , I ... This ... at the Magic Box , on the floor . I was cleaning , and I ... forgot ... - But I did n't summon anything . - Well , now , that 's a twist . If it was in the shop ... then one of us probably ... - Xander ? ! - Well , I did n't know what was gon na happen . I just thought there were gon na be dances and songs .

" And I go , " He starts crying ? " That 's funny . You write for a network and they 're so paranoid about everything . Like , you 'll write a sketch , and they 'll come back ... " Yeah , this Adolf Hitler sketch is funny could he not be anti-semitic ? " And , um , three of these klansmen need to be black . Right . Is it bad when you refer to all alcohol as " Pain-Go-Bye-Bye Juice " ? No . Is that bad ? Not at all , I mean ... Like , easter is like ... When I was growing up ... If you wanted to color eggs , there was only one game in town , " Paas " you had to go to " Paas . And then , there was a little wire torture chair you 'd put the egg in and you 'd lower it into the water . Or like me , you 'll put all the tablets in one glass of water and then the eggs would come out brown . " Oh , brilliant , good Patton ! You ca n't get brown eggs ! That 's our little prodigy ! " And then you could take the box , and you could punch the holes out in the back and make the box into an egg holder . And that was it ... You went to " Paas . " And then ... Remember when there was all those other companies that came by trying to topple the Paas empire ? In the ' 70s there was " Shake ' N Egg " ... I 'm not sure what you mean . " Shake ' N Egg " was where you would put the egg in a bag with all this glitter ... And there was the " Ronco " egg-coloring thing it was was like a weird inquisition device where you 'd put the egg in a clamp and you 'd put a magic marker and then you could turn the egg and it would make a line on the egg . And if you were willing to spend , like , 4 hours you could make , like , a grid design . Which is great , if you were a contractor or ... " See , I 've broken the egg down into its component vectors ... " But recently I was in the store and I 'm looking at the egg-coloring kits there 's only one company left standing ... " Paas " ! And you know what their kit is ? The 6 color tablets , the little wire thing , and you can punch out the back and make a hole . They did n't change a thing ! I so respect that ! We are Paas ! Happy Easter and go to hell ! I 'm not changing a damn thing ! " Hey , dad ? Ben , where are you ? You 're not gon na believe where I 'm calling from ! I hope you 're not calling from the plane , ' cause ... I 'm in the plane . That is instead of our trip to Europe , Ben . This is a ridiculously expensive thing to do . How 's the trip ? It 's fairly smooth , I got very nervous during takeoff and then right after takeoff . But it 's not a full plane so there 's plenty of empty seats here and I got moved to the back ' cause I was making other passengers nervous . Statistically , the 3 most dangerous parts of flying , Ben : Taking off , the landing , and all that stuff in the middle . Dad ! I ... The planes are so modern now . It 's been about a year since I 've flown and they have really updated . Oh , everything has changed . The fleet is ... Spankin ' new ! There are men now , who serve drinks ... Those are women . Oh , I was gon na say , this is ridiculous . I mean , what 's happening to society when men can get equal jobs to women ? That 's true . But , I guess , the workplace is just evening out ... Okay , Ben , I love you and ... You do n't wan na stay on ? No , just call me when you land . I would like to know that you 've landed safely . Okay , I will do that . Maybe I 'll call you back after the movie , tell you about it . Hello ? Ben ! Dad ! Ben , I expected Sarah to answer the phone ! Well , I 'm at Sarah 's . She went to work . Oh , so you got the place to yourself ! Yeah , oh yeah ! It 's really nice . Is it going okay ? You guys getting along ? She good company ? Sarah picked me up at the airport and that 's the last I saw of her . Just dropped you off at the house and left you there ? No , actually it 's kinda weird ' cause she had plans last night . I 'm sure she wants to show you around . Well , no , she had plans that she kept with other people . You do n't feel comfortable tagging along ? No , it was because ... I was n't invited . That 's odd , that you 'd travel ... I do n't necessarily blame her she does have to work in the day and then wind down with her friends at night . At least I 'm glad you stuck around for my call . Sarah left me a list . I have to go shopping for her ... Sounds to me like you 're being a good sport . I do n't mind ' cause it 's Sarah and she has a very nice place . What is it like ? It 's very big . And she 's a lawyer . Right . You been through her drawers yet ? Good morning , sunshine girl . You 're feeling pretty chipper , seems like . Yeah , I feel pretty good today . I just feel like , a sense of peace has come over me ... I just have this distinct feeling of ... Well-being ? " No Ben " . I wish I could share your enthusiasm ... You can ! I have to admit , I miss the guy ! I really do . Yeah ? Do you miss him a little bit ? Not really . You do like him , though ... Umm ... okay . I do n't think you realize how much you mean to him . Katz 's office . could I speak to Laura , please ? Oh , Ben . I 'm not here . Laura , I did n't recognize you . Umm . That 's better . Uhh . There you are . Found you ! Why are you calling ? I just wanted to ... Give uh ... you know ... Where 's the old Laura that answered the phone ? Ben , how is it possible that you 're more annoying when you 're away ? ! Well , I just wanted to , you know ... Tell my dad what I 've done the last 2 hours but I can tell you . Sarah 's still at work . I am still in the apartment , and I 'm gon na probably meet Sarah for lunch ' cause she knows this little spot downtown , umm ... Called " The cafeteria where she works " ... But , uh , I 'll tell you , Laura , this city is fantastic !.. And it looks great ! Right . Man , I 'm bored here ! It 's so hard to have sex with women . They 're all so , like ... " No ! " Yeah . I hope I become famous , Dr . Katz ! ' Cause if you get famous , you get to have sex with a lot of women , and you get to be in orgies and stuff ... Oh my god , have you ever been in an orgy ? I 've ... I always had a scheduling problem . I ca n't wait for my first orgy . I 'm gon na be so excited ! I 'm gon na show up extra early help put up the decorations ... I wonder how orgies works , though . Do you just jump in ? Or is there orgy etiquette ? Like , do you have to announce it first ? Like , " Mitch Fatel ! Comin ' in on the right !.. With missing me ? You know what , Ben ? You do n't have to say it , I know you 're torn . I think I really would miss you if you ever left me alone for more than 10 minutes . Hmm , alright . Make me miss you , Ben , make me miss you . I like the way you 're talking . Dr . Katz , I was reading this book and they said hypnotism can help you remember your childhood , so I think that you should hypnotize me ! Okay , it 's not my strength ... I-am-now-hypnotized ! I had a bad childhood ! Do you want me to act like a chicken ? That would be nice ! I am not hypnotized anymore ! You know they say you ca n't be hypnotized if you do n't want to be . I-am-now hypnotized . Even though the kid drives me crazy , he is my best friend in the whole world . Yeah . Ha , oh ... You need somebody like that ! I could use a " Deaf ear " . I think it 's very important that he get out there ... See if he can function as an adult human . I think this trip is very good for him even though it was stressful ... The whole thing of packing and knowing what to take . Right . You know , when I was a sales manager ... - Did you just eat your booger ? - No ! Then what did you do with it ? There was n't any ! There was n't any ! Did you wipe it under the bar ? No ! Did you ? Let me feel under the bar , see if there 's any ... - Oh my god ! - Oh my god ! Aaahhhhhh ! Dad ! Oh god , I hope that 's you , Ben ! It is me ! Shut up for one second and give your father a hello hug ! Tell me about the trip , tell me everything ! Ssshhh ! Let me get it out ! I came home early because I ... Not ' cause I missed you ... But because , uh ... Was it fun to be with her ? It was good at first . It was good seeing her at the airport . Uh-huh . And then it was good seeing her once again when she saw me off at the airport . She 's very busy . Very demanding job , being a lawyer . I 've learned a lot about what it 's like to be busy . I was hoping that maybe some of her get-up-and-go would rub off on you ! It 's not that easy , dad . You got ta go to law school , and , uh , you got ta train , professionally . You ca n't just do the rubbing-off thing anymore . Although I did pick her up and rubbed . I tell you something I did ... I liked flying ... now I realize . The flight back was much better than the flight going . You start to get used to it . Were you sitting in the aisle or the window ? No , aisle . I prefer the aisle . Why ? ' Cause I never really like asking someone to get up when I have to go to the bathroom . Right . And if you 're on the aisle , you 're your own man . Yeah , it 's more freedom . I 'll tell you when I 'm gon na get up , I 'm not gon na ask you . I 'll go right here ! The window ... you have to ask a couple of people sometimes . Yeah . " Sorry to bother you " . They have to get up and get in the aisle . Right . Then when you come back , the whole thing again . Yeah . And then later in the flight , you have to go again . That 's why , for me , the aisle is , really , the most desirable seat there is . Good-night . I was reading about , uhh , these places ... There 's some in Florida and some in California called " Midget villages " . And only midgets live there , it 's all fenced off . You got ta be a midget to get in . And all the houses and the cars are scaled down to their height and ... maybe I 'm a little bit perverse ... I would love to get really liquored up and then hop the fence and just walk through the town going ... Woooo ! That would be so good for my self-esteem , you know . Yeah ! Attack of the 5 ' 5 " guy ! My god those are 30-length pants ! I do n't know where I stand on the gay issue , Dr . Katz ! Like I just agree with whoever I 'm talking to . " And then another guy can be , like , " What 2 people do in their privacy in their own home is their own business " and I 'm like , " Aah , I love men ! " You know what the music means , Mitch . We 're gon na have to stop now . Do you think I can bring my own music next time ? If I let you bring your music , I 'd have too let everybody bring their own music . Am I your favorite out of everybody ? I want you to be very honest with me . It would help me a lot ...

Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Heller ! Granddad , why are we watching a Winston Jerome play ? Ah , shut up , boy . Stop hating . It just so happens Winston Jerome is holding an open casting call for the leading man in his new play , and I 'm preparing for my audition . Audition ? Like an acting audition ? Acting audition of a lifetime . But you do n't act . Oh-ho-ho-ho ! But this was long before the days of Terrence Howard . See , Hollywood did n't have room for a young , handsome , light-skinned black man with good hair in those days . And action . They call me Mr . Pibb . What 's so funny ? Mr . Pibb . That 's a soda 's name . Oh , is it " ribs " ? They call me Mr . ribs . He is so bad . Bull  Mr . handyman ! Oh ! My foot ! My foot ! Oh ! Ooh ! Cramp ! Cramping real bad ! Oh ! Maybe you 'd like to see a real man . I bet you stay up late dreaming you had a real man . I pity the fool . Thank you . That 's enough . We 'll call you . Thank you for the opportunity . Breaking into Hollywood at your age ? He 's looking for mature men . See , look right here . " Casting for a black leading " man , 50 and older . " That 's me all day . Do n't you ever think you 're too old to do some of that stuff you do ? Why ca n't I be a sex symbol ? Why ca n't I be a heartthrob ? I say do it before it 's too late . And it 's gon na be too late real soon , so , uh , yeah . Hurry up . Thank you , Riley . I 'm gon na really let him have it , show him my stuff , give that man everything I got . Pause . Pause ? Pause what ? You said something gay , so you got to say " no-homo , " or else you 's a homo . What did I say gay ? You said you was gon na give this dude everything you got - - no-homo . That 's not gay . I said I was gon na give the man everything I got . Pause , granddad . " Okay . You want to be a homo . Stop calling your granddaddy a homo ! Then say " no-homo . " I do n't want to say " no-homo . " I 'm gon na homo your ass , you do n't stop saying " pause . " Pause . The typical Winston Jerome story starts with a beautiful , educated , professional black woman trapped in a troubled marriage with the brown-skinned bald dude from " law order . " How can you do this to me ? Get out ! I 'm gon na marry this white hussy because you are too virtuous and strong and might make me a better man . Then a dude who looks like Shemar Moore shows up as the shirtless light-skinned gardener who just got out of jail . Excuse me , uh , may I rake your leaves ? At first , she acts like she does n't like the light-skinned gardener . Oh , lord , thank you , Jesus ! I never thought I 'd ever be with a man so loving and light-skinned . And I will always be light-skinneded just for you . Being a good Christian woman , she gives her marriage one last chance , because Jesus said so . I am dark-skinned and bald , so I hate you , and I hate Jesus . Just when the brown-skinned dude from " Law Order " is about to hit her , here comes the shirtless gardener . Hold it right there , bald-headed dude from " Law Order " ! The woman and the gardener kiss , having found true love through Jesus . Which role are you auditioning for ? Oh , no , no . You ca n't get her . I did n't think there would be this many people here just for a play . Wait a minute . You 're Kadeem Hardison , star of TV 's " A Different World . " What are you doing here ? I do n't know if you know this , but there ai n't exactly a bunch of other  We could be doing right now . I mean , what , I 'm supposed to wait for the next " Akeelah and the bee " to pay my mortgage ? Huh ? No , thanks . It 's him ! Back this way , man . Shh ! Mm-hmm . Mnh-mnh . Mr . Jerome would like to see you . He would ? You wo n't be needing that shirt . Jesus told me in my next play Ma'dukes should find herself a man . Yeah . Try this line . " Ma'dukes , you are a strong , " intelligent black woman who will " make me a better man . " Ma'dukes - - wait , wait . Something 's off . Lotion ! What flavor you want , man ? I got tropical peach , sunrise orange , minty mango , and apricot . Or I can just take two flavors and swirl them together . Just tell me which ones you like . You want me to pick one for you ? Minty mango it is . Hmm . Turn around . Hey ! You want me to pop these bumps ? Uh , no . All right . You good , then . Okay , Robert . Again . M'dukes - - that 's it ! Breathtaking ! You know , I remember when I sat down to write my first play . I asked Jesus , " will you cowrite with me ? " And he said , " yes . " Since that day , I 've searched the world for the sexiest black men alive . And I found them - - my shirtless men . And Jesus was pleased . I did n't know religion worked like that . Then I asked Jesus , " how can I further spread your message on " earth ? " And he said , " cross-dressing . " And so I put on a dress and a wig , and Jesus was pleased . With that dress , that wig , and these beautiful , muscular gifts from God , I have built an empire . And soon I will crush ice cube , and my supremacy of black Hollywood will be complete ! Ice cube ? We do n't allow just anyone on this journey . Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and savior , Robert ? Yeah , uh , I-I guess . Get on your knees , Robert . Ow ! On your knees , Robert ! Okay ! Do you accept me , Winston Jerome , as the representative of Jesus Christ in the TV and movie business ? Sure . I guess . Do you renounce ice cube and all his works ? Well , you know , I kind of like " Friday " - - do you renounce ice cube and all his works ? ! I renounce ice cube . Louder ! I renounce ice cube ! And all his works ! And all his works ! Including " Friday " ? Yes ! Including " Friday " ! Yes ! Rise ! Rise , my new leading man ! We 're having a fondue shindig at the compound tonight . You should come . Tom , thanks for agreeing to watch the boys tonight . No problem , Robert . I mean , this is your big break . So , what is he like ? Who ? Winston ? Uh ... Nice guy , down-to-earth . Nothing strange or freaky or bizarre about him at all . That 's what people need more of - - positive entertainment , without all the cursing and people saying the n-word all the time . Hey , are there gon na be some steamy scenes to look forward to , huh ? Who 's the lucky leading lady ? Uh , actually , um ... They have n't cast her yet . Probably , uh , Sanaa Lathan , maybe Halle Berry ... You know , somebody hot . Man , stop lying ! Granddad 's leading lady is a dude . What ? Shut up , boy ! You do n't know nothing ! We read the script , granddad . How dare you read that script ? ! That 's top secret ! It was really , really terrible , by the way . Do n't front , granddad . You playin ' a dude 's boyfriend . It 's that Winston Jerome guy in a dress ! Ha ! You mean Ma'dukes ? You 're playing Ma'dukes ' boyfriend ? There are no love scenes . I think that 's great . Robert , you 're a real actor now , completely dedicated to the part ! I say do the love scenes ! But there are no love scenes ! Well , I think it 's gay . Dude wear a dress ! Jesus told him to wear that dress ! You just mad ' cause Jesus does n't love you . Hello , Robert . We 're so glad you decided to join us . Come in . I do n't mind if I do , cupcakes . Hello , how do you do ? We 're so glad you joined our crew . Welcome to our lovely compound , where it all goes down . Is that in the play ? No , we just do that for fun . Come , let me show you the compound . The cast and crew of my plays are like family . We work together , eat together , pray together . Now , let me show you where you 'll be staying . Um , did you say " staying " ? Oh , yes . You 'll live here at the compound during the run of the play . I want everyone totally immersed in the production . And we do n't allow outside calls here . We must remove all distractions . Tell them you wo n't be coming home for a while . Best to make it a clean break . Uh , I 'll just call ' em back . Answer it ! Hey , boys . Hey , granddad , we were just wondering how late rehearsal was gon na go . Tom had to leave , and we 're getting kind of hungry . Well , uh , I 'm not coming home for a while , so do n't wait up . How late ? Uh , maybe a week or two or more . We got a lot of rehearsal stuff to do . Uh , there 's some cash in my sock drawer . Praise Jesus . This is a great day , brothers and sisters . The first day of rehearsals for " Ma'dukes finds herself a man " ! Let us pray . Lord Jesus , you are a wonderful savior and an excellent producing partner , as well ... Waa waa waa-waa ...  I ca n't believe I 'm here . Man , look at these broads in here . The big ' ol zesty-chesty on that one . ... In Jesus ' name we pray . Amen . Yes , amen . Yeah , boy ! We 're so happy you 're here with us , Robert . Jesus is so good . I 've been working with Mr . Jerome for nearly 10 years . Oh , your family must be very proud . Honey , I do n't talk to my family anymore . This is my family now . Soon it 'll be yours , too . I 'm gon na get me some kool-aid . Well , this is my first Winston Jerome project , but I 've been in the business for almost 12 years . Oh , that 's nice . Anything I might have seen ? Let 's see . All that time , I was giving up the ass for me . Now I only give up the ass for Jesus ... And his homeboys . Mm-hmm . Praise Jesus in the name of Jesus . Robert , would you join me in my study ? Beautiful , is n't it ? I had the sweater put on him because he just looked so cold up there . I just wanted to warm him up ... Because I love Jesus . Do you love Jesus , Robert ? Oh , yes . I love me some Jesus , mm-hmm . He 's my copilot . Lord , we thank you for ... Well , it appears you love ta-tas , too . Yeah , uh , I 'm , uh ... It 's okay , Robert . You love women more than you love Jesus , do n't you ? It 's hard to say . I mean , it 's kind of apples and oranges . Well , now , since you put it like that , I want some of them , uh , Alicia keys and a couple them Beyonc ? s and something Spanish and a big-ol ' - tittied white woman that look like Lynda Carter . Then Jesus will provide them . But you must give yourself to Jesus first , Robert ... and to me . You know how I feel about the  phone ! It 's my grandkids . They 're probably just worried . You must choose , Robert , between your old life and your new one . Hey , boys . Uh , no , everything 's good . Look , please do n't call me again . This is my family now . Uh-huh . Okay . You made the right choice , Robert . I do n't get it . They his new family now ? It 's worse than I thought . Granddad 's in a cult . A cult ? That 's gay . Well , he 's in trouble . We got to save him . Cut ! Frown ! How are they gon na know you 're mad if you do n't frown ? More ! More , more , damn it ! You want me to put something nasty in your mouth to help you frown ? ! Ugh . Okay , continue . Well , at least I have Jesus and the strong love of a black , African , beautiful , independent black woman - - cut , cut , cut , cut , cut ! This is n't working ! I can not work like this anymore ! I 've worked with Jesus ! Damn it ! Let us pray . Jesus , Holy Jesus ... Help us with this scene . It seems to be a little flat . Wait - - Jesus is trying to tell me something . Hold on . Praise Jesus ! Yes , Jesus . Uh-huh . Right , right . Hey , you 're the boss . Jesus says the scene would have more impact if you grabbed Ma'dukes and kissed her deep on the lips . Change it in the script ! Praise Jesus ' rewrites ! Are you sure he did n't say " kick " ? I should kick you ? Or maybe " kill " ? Let me kill you . Nobody 'd ever see that coming . No ! He said " kiss " ! Kiss ! There was no ambiguity at all . Chapstick ! Robert , it 's okay . I totally understand your concerns . Winston Jerome would never , ever kiss a man . That would be homosexual and against my Christian faith . Whew ! Exactly ! Mine too ! But Jesus wants us to be actors first and heterosexuals second . Now , Winston Jerome is a very , very straight man that loves the ladies . But Ma'dukes is a woman , and when I go onstage , Jesus wants me to become her , inside and out . I ca n't just have a woman 's clothes . Excuse me , do you know where I could find Robert Freeman ? Just walk in the path of Jesus . You 'll find him . Uh , excuse me . We 're looking for Robert Freeman . Oh , he 's on the rehearsal stage . Y'all remind me of my grandsons . But they like ice cube movies , so I ca n't never speak to them again . Excuse me . I 'm gon na get me some kool-aid . Well , at least I have Jesus and the love of a strong , black , African , beautiful , independent black woman ! And that 's all I need . Aah ! Oof ! Boys ! Stop that ! Get his legs ! His legs ! I rebuke you in the name of the lord ! Get them ! Ow ! Get them out of here ! These niggas is too glisteny . Did you think you could just take him ? It 's too late . Your granddaddy is one of us now . It 's okay , guys . Granddad , snap out of it ! Ow ! Damn it ! Ow ! Nigga , have you lost your  damn mind ? Granddad , you 've been brainwashed . You 've been sucked into some bizarre homoerotic Christian theater cult ! Yeah , you was about to kiss that dude , no-homo . Boy , I 'm just acting . I know it 's a homoerotic Christian theater cult , but if it gets me into Hollywood , who cares ? It ca n't be worse than Scientology . Do you really want to be famous that bad ? Yes . My whole life , I 've been normal . Normal sucks ! I want women half my age to throw themselves at me ! I want people to treat me better than they treat other people . And Riley was right - - I do n't have much time left . Maybe it 's a stupid dream , but this is the last chance I 'm gon na get at it . No-homo . And when you get home , go in my clean-underwear drawer . There should be $200 in quarters . That should be enough to get you through the week , and I 'll be home soon , okay ? All right , granddad . If this is really what you want , we 'll get out of here . Good luck with that . Thank you for saying " no-homo , " granddad . That really meant a lot to me . No-homo . * Uh-huh , uh-huh * Well , at least I have Jesus and the love of a strong , black , African , beautiful , independent black woman ! And that 's all I need . Kiss me , Ma'dukes ! And now it 's time for me to get my big prize . Huh ? Uh-uh-aah ! Oh , you look just like your pictures on MySpace ! Oh , my goodness ! Mr . Jerome would like to see you ... Alone . Robert ! You were amazing . Jesus and I were so pleased . Do n't give me that bull  This is the big prize ? Where are the Alicia Keyses ? Where are the Beyonc ? s ? Where 's wonder woman ? All I see is Florida Evanses ! I can get a big bitch on my own ! I had to kiss you onstage in front of everybody , and all I get is them mud ducks out there ? ! That was n't the deal ! Robert , Jesus never said it would happen overnight . Well , how long do I have to suck lips with you before the women out there become hot ? Look , Robbie , I 've just sold " Ma'dukes finds herself a man " as a movie . And guess who 's my leading man ? Really ? I 'm gon na be in a movie . Look , man , all bull  Aside . Can I please just have some ass ? Okay . Wait a minute ! You mean to tell me you made up this whole cross-dressing Christian-cult crap just so you could sleep with men ? Uh , pretty much , yeah .  you ! Now stick that up your ass ! No-homo . Pause . Pause again . Pause again , granddad ! Pause again . Pause again . Pause again , granddad . Pause again , granddad .

Just announce that P.E . Is indoors today ! Sorry . I missed it . I like that you went there , though . Um , is that my face on your trapper keeper ? Yep . You know I have a girlfriend , right ? - Alison . - I know . I call next . Ri-i-ight . See you , Reba . I hate to see him go , but I love to watch his butt . Are you still on the computer ? I want to work on my keyboarding . We need to monitor how many people are seeing this stain on our reputation . Luckily , it 's holding steady at 149 . You would n't be able to tell unless you hit the refresh button . Refresh button ? It went up to 154 ! Phil wrote back . He says he 'll give us another chance . He 's coming back to the restaurant on Wednesday . Okay , this is our shot at redemption . We need to make sure Cattleman 's Ranch is funner than it 's ever been ... Even if it means replacing every " c " with a backward " k . " Four ... Hello . ' Sup ? 555-c-o-r-n . Hello ? Hello . Who 's this ? Dad ? Sweetie ? Hello ? Is someone on the phone ? Hello . Who 's this ? This is Louis Huang . Who 's this ? This is Gary Olsen . Gary Olsen ? That was a disaster . I know . I was listening . I hate talking on the phone . She ca n't see me , and I 'm like 80% body language . It 'll do the talking for me ! That 's a great idea , Eddie . Yo , girl . This is your boy , E-Money ... Notorious E.I.G ... E to the M.C.-Squared . What 's up , physics ? For the next 90 minutes , I 'm gon na make you an audio love nest , ' cause , girl , if you 're feeling this ... Look at these fun hens just sitting here , sunglasses on , ready for the beach . Festive hens , new staff uniforms , googly eyes on the toothpick dispenser ... No way Phil can call us dull . Uh , Mitch ? Yeah ? Your new comically small hat is n't askew enough . It 's supposed to be sitting on your head at a jaunty angle . That angle is not jaunty . Jauntier . Jauntier . Jaunty . Hey , hey . Hello ? Down here . Phillip Goldstein , what are you doing here ? I have a reservation . It 's under Phil ... As in " Phil 's Phaves . Phillip Goldstein , the Chinese-Jewish boy who abandoned our son at the Beastie Boys concert . I sleep well at night , if that 's your next question . Of course you sleep well . You 're a child ! I thought Phil was an adult . Probably because my writing style is straightforward and concise , like a man 's . Well , whatever our differences , it is a relief to find out it 's you , just like you 're finding out that this is our restaurant . So you can gahead and change your review . Why would I do that ? Well , you know ... I actually do n't understand Chinese , but I do understand good service . Do I have to seat myself ? More iced tea ? - No , thank you . - Okay . Um , that crayon looks stubby . Here . Let me get you some fresh points . No , those are fine ! Oh , I thought that was a typo . This is ridiculous . He 's just gon na give us a bad review anyway . I would never let our personal history color my review . Oh . Mm . That said , I 'm bumping you down to a c-plus . A c-plus ? ! Did you see the sunglasses on the hens ? I did n't , because your staff was surrounding me at every moment ... refilling my mug , taking my crayons . It was a nightmare ! Nuggets were good , though . And that 's why I say that Marky Mark is the nucleus of the funky bunch . Huh ? I made you something . You did ? What is it ? After class . All right , now to turn our attention from the subatomic world to the state-mandated , although not state-funded , unit on dissection . Namely ... Rocks ? No . Oysters . Yeah . Like Marky Mark , let 's do the unexpected . Alison , you can partner with Ned . Eddie , you 're with Reba . No . You 're in my station . Hi , Eddie . This is gon na be fun . For who ? I understand . You 're too gentle to dissect a living creature . But lucky for us , I do n't give an " elf . " I 'll fill out your dissection journal for you . All right . Let 's see what 's under the hood . Cattleman 's Ranch is our livelihood . So you can understand our concern when we found your son 's website . Oh , I do understand . I am so sorry about Phillip 's review . Great . So you 'll take it down ? Oh , no , I ca n't do that . Phillip 's father and I have been teaching him about journalistic integrity from our years working at Mother Jones . Miteh , haust du gizane mana ... Oy . Only one Chinese boy can tarnish the Huang family name , and that 's Eddie . Please take down your website ! I ca n't do that . It 's called integrity , madam . - But I just want you ... - W-we understand . Thanks for hearing us out . We 'll be on our way . May I just use your restroom first ? I did n't really go to the bathroom . Is that their computer mouse ? Yes . I 've crippled his access to the Internet . I 've shut him down . You 're a genius . Eddie , it 's for you ! It 's a girl ! Alison ? Do n't worry . It 's not her . Reba ? I got your mixtape , and I love you , too ! Oh , da-a-mn . Evan ? ! No . Reba ? Egg-salad Reba ? Why do n't you just tell her the mixtape was n't for her ? I tried . Reba , I made that mixtape for Alison , not for you . I understand . I 'll talk to Alison for you . No ! I mean , I 'll do it . Like what sisters with voices said on your mixtape , You put sisters with voices on there ? It 's a good-ass song . Good morning , students ! To the mix master supreme who taught me the way to a woman 's heart is through her ear holes . Hi , Eddie ! A big shoutout to my new boyfriend ... Tell the firemen I know how busy they are and I 'm sorry ! I do n't understand . How did Phillip update it ? Taking his mouse does n't make his website disappear . But he has no way to control the little hand . There 's only one thing to do . Evan , I 'm extending your bedtime . But why ? ! I need you to make me a website . I ca n't believe Our luck is finally turning around . I 'm not sure I 'm comfortable with this ... " f . " Table manners ... " c . " He used his salad fork properly . Grudging respect . Mm . This is like teasing someone but on the computer . It 's like we 're ... E-vigilantes , because we 're dishing out justice and clearing our name . If Trent had n't pulled that fire alarm , Alison would think I had a honey on the side . This Reba girl 's out of control . Eddie , you can clear this whole thing up if you just call Alison . No . Not gon na happen . I need to look my woman in the eye like a snake charmer . So what are you gon na do ? If a good mixtape can make Reba think I love her , then a bad mixtape can scare her away ! I 'm a genius ! Emery , get out . You 're in my room . Oh . Hey . I got all the lamest CDs from my dad 's collection ... These are perfect , Nicole . Weird choices for a mixtape . Well , it 's kind of an anti-mixtape . Oh , a nixtape . Been there . You trying to get rid of Alison ? No . Alison is dope . It 's this other girl . You know , it 's a long story . So , how 's what's-his-name ? Hot Chris ? He 's hot . He did this Forrest Gump impression the other day . It was hilarious . Lieutenant Dan , I got you ice cream . Well , I better get going . For the record , you never made me a mixtape . No sign of him yet ? He 'll show . Hello , Mr . and Mrs . Huang . Well , how did you get in here ? Through the kitchen . In keeping with your barn theme , the door was open . It 's a ranch ! I want you to take down What 's that ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . But who knows ? Maybe if you take down your bad review , that site will magically disappear . Obviously you do n't understand how magic works . Oh , and you do ? He just carries those around ? I keep underestimating him . I have some bad news . Apparently a cat got into the storage room last night and ate up all the oyster cadavers . So , project complete . Yes ! Hey , Reba , I made you a new mixtape . So prolific . You 're like the Stephen King of love . Eddie ! Is there something you want to share with the rest of the class ? " The real me " ? It 's a tape . Huh . I guess there 's no way of knowing ... You could put it in the tape deck you used to teach us about the doppler effect . That 's a very good idea , Ned . Let 's do that . - Yo , Reba ... - Reba ? ! Unfortunately , there 's a new threat targeting our students in our libraries , on our desktops , in our homes . It 's called ... Compu-teasing . Uh-oh . Compu-teasing ... What 's that ? It 's like a crank call , but on a computer , and anyone can listen in . And sadly , one of our students has already fallen victim . He 's still into drama . My name is Phillip Goldstein . I used to enjoy posting restaurant reviews on my Internet website . But ever since I found a page compu-teasing me , I 've been too scared to use my computer . You 're doing great , Phillip . I have my suspicions about who 's behind the teasing , but without proof , I wo n't accuse anyone . They can insult me all they want , but I wo n't let them take my integrity . That makes me love him even more . That makes me want to kill whoever 's hurting him . So we 've created the city 's first cyber-crime division , headed up by Peter . With Peter 's help , we will track down Phillip 's compu-teasers and bring them to justice . Rest assured , we will not stop . They 're just trying to scare us . They got nothing . They got nothing . According to our research , the website was made on a gateway computer . He bought it ! He bought the computer ! Uh , what ? No ! It was her idea to do the website . Wait . Are you saying you 're the compu-teasers ? No . We 're e-vigilantes . He said Cattleman 's Ranch was dull . You know me . You all know me . I am fun . I am fun , damn it ! Great work , Peter . Hey , Eddie . You okay ? I heard what happened . My life is ruined . I 'll be lucky if Alison ever speaks to me again . Eddie , just talk to her . Just call her . You embarrassed yourself . Trying to discourage me with some cornball mixtape . I know I come on a little strong , but you know what ? That 's who I am . And if you ca n't handle that , we 're never gon na work . Find yourself , boy . Reba . Hello ? Hey , Alison . It 's Eddie . Do n't hang up . I 'm ... Sorry . This whole thing happened because I was too afraid to talk to you on the phone . I mean , Eddie , nothing you say is gon na ... Eddie . And that 's why I 'm doing this special live apology mix , just for you . And , girl , I 'm hoping you 'll say ... This is n't gon na make ... Kid can make a mixtape . The hell ? Where 's the computer ? ! We put it away after being publicly shamed in front of Eddie 's entire school . You 'll sign me in , right ? But you just spent all that money on it . Well , the good thing about computers is they last forever . We 'll hook it back up in a few years - when you boys are older . - Once the heat dies down . But I just enrolled in the University of Phoenix . I 'm minoring in nursing !

Kara , do not walk away from me .   But I 'm regent . They should respect me . The target on your back , it comes with the job . You got to respond with a show of force . What are you doing to us ? The Crescent curse . Now you will be trapped in wolf form . You 're trespassing . This whole area is now property of kingmaker land development . My team and I are animal control . Hayley ! Hayley ! Hayley ! Jackson : Where is she ? Where the hell is Hayley ?  Davina , let me out of here right now , or I swear I will kill you . You can try , or we could have a polite conversation . Do not talk to me about polite . I drew you here to help you . Elijah asked you months ago to break the curse , and you said no . The regent of witches ca n't be seen doing favors for the Mikaelsons , but maybe we can help each other . Look . I have access to the witch ancestors . I can channel the power of the one who created the spell used to curse you . You can be free , Hayley . Under your terms , I 'm guessing . Spill . There 's a witch in the ninth ward who hates that I 'm regent . She tried to kill me . If I retaliate , I 'm starting a civil war , and I do n't want to do that . Fine . Just tell me who you want dead . ugh .  Ergh ! Unh . Take my blood . I 'm good . We need to find Hayley . There 's still no sign of her . I 've seen the bodies . Any wolf that was n't taken out scattered . Elijah , how many bodies ? A trap would n't hold Hayley after she turned back . Nothing would stop her from seeing that little girl . Something 's wrong . Where are you going ? I 'm taking my niece home . Then I 'll continue the search . You stay here , you tend to your dead . No , no . Look . I got 5 hours until I 'm a wolf again . Elijah , she 's my wife .  Need a break from family drama ? Thank you . You see , I 've been trying to get my brothers to mend fences , but Elijah remains bitter , and Klaus remains obstinate , thus tequila ! Thing is , it 's almost midnight . Well , I 'm not wearing glass slippers . Do you have to turn the best club in town into your personal blood bank ? We feed on tourists , compel them to forget , locals turn a blind eye ... - I 'll pass . - Good . This one 's coming with me .  Woman : ? I 'm gon na lose my faith . I 'm gon na burn it out . I 'm talking to myself . The walls are coming down . And every breath that I take . Feels like the last , and I 'm tired . Every time it 's a shot in the dark . And I do n't know why . I 'm feeling brave tonight . I never won , I do n't know why ... ? Lucien : Listen to the advice of your superiors , then do better . Study the weaknesses of those who outrank you and eliminate them from your own experience . Authority is meant to be challenged . Great achievers refuse to stand in shadows .  ? I kept it to myself . I learned to turn it down . And I 've been living with the memory ... How about a little decency ? That kid 's got a family . I 'm not instagramming it . I 'm with the " sentinel . " Would you care to comment on all the rumors ... Behind the tape , please . Sirens , @radio_chatter ? I never won , I do n't know why . I never won , I do n't know why . Whoa ? I thought I smelled swamp . What 'd you do with Hayley ? Tell me what you know . Has Jackson misplaced his bride ? Come to think about it , I did read that global warming has disrupted migration patterns . Try Georgia . I just left the bodies of people I care about to rot in the woods because you left them defenseless against poachers sent by kingmaker land development . That ring a bell ? Yeah . The CEO is Lucien Castle . Elijah tells me that you two go way back . So I will ask you once again ... You could use a good laugh . Stay here . Niklaus and I will deal with this . Actually , as long as Hayley is prowling about on two legs and unaccounted for , I am staying with my daughter , and should I discover that this is yet another cockeyed scheme for Hayley and you to abscond with her ... The paltry remains of your beloved wolf pack will be sniffing at your entrails come morning . This does n't frighten you , brother , but one day , your daughter will know exactly the kind of man that her father is . If anything should happen to Hayley , you mark my words , no one will have to take hope from you . She will without question leave you of her own accord . You 're completely cloth . She runs the Caf ? Chim Lac in the Lower Ninth Ward . She 'll be there before done . As long as the candle burns , your curse wo n't be active . And when a strong wind comes along ? My magic will protect the flame . Of course , you 'll have to work with me . - Err . - Unh ! I 'm doing this for my pack . If I turn into a wolf tonight before seeing my daughter , I will come for you , Davina , and I will tear you apart . When the sun comes up tomorrow and you 're still you , you 'll owe me an apology . Heh . Unh ! You have two hours . Get it done . Klaus : Freya , I 'm aware that 21st century technology remains a mystery to you , but when you see my name pop up on your phone , you answer it . Come home immediately . You appeared through the window like a creeper . Besides , this is a matter of life and death . Oh , how novel . Call it a hunch , but I think your friend Lucien is torturing and killing humans in the quarter . There have been two victims so far , but I 've constructed a psychological profile of the killer , and I do n't think it 's going to end there . Lucien would never be so sloppy . Although I admit there is a familiar method to this particular madness . You want to prove to me you 're turning over a new leaf ? Make sure this latest victim is the last one . Heh . Are you suggesting I prove my redeemability by killing my oldest friend ? Such irony . Look . Nola pd ca n't take down a thousand-year-old psycho with vampire powers , but you can . You 're the smartest and the strongest and the scariest , so make him stop .    Elijah , what a glorious pleasure . It 's a boundary spell . No vampire from another sire line can enter without an invitation ... Ahem ... given the circumstances , you know . Lucien , I did n't come here to chinwag . Your little corporation has been butchering wolves in the Bayou Lafourche . It 's population control . There 's viable land out there , viable , that is , once the sudden influx of mangy wildlife has been eliminated . I take it you are alluding to the Crescent pack . Hayley Kenner , one of the alphas , is missing . The , uh , hybrid Nik knocked up ? Heh . Surprised by your concern , Elijah . When your family left her to prowl the woods all these months , I just figured the tramp was persona non grata , fair game . Unh !  Huhhh ! Aah ! Aah !  Now he asked you what your hunters did to my wife . Answers now . Err . You go to the compound , fetch the chains from the carriage room . My darling Lucien , I 'm quite happy to stand here and watch you die , or you can invite me in . The choice is yours .  Aah ! Ohh ! Hey . Hey . It 's just me . Maybe not the best time to be sneaking up on people . Oh , sorry . It 's been a long night . I saw you walking in . Thought you might not mind pouring me a drink . Nightcap ? You 'll find bourbon on basically every horizontal surface . Or we could skip to the fun part . Freya ! It is about time you brought a gentleman home to meet the family . I 'm Freya 's brother , and you are ? No . Do n't tell me . Let me guess ... Brad , Chad , Brody ? Let 's go with Brody . What are your intentions for my sister ? Shall we discuss a dowry ? Bro , what the ... Leave now . Not 3 months ago , you utterly despised me . Now you 're playing protective brother . I 'm sure you 're quite capable of protecting yourself from the scourge of fraternity row . I need you to perform a locator spell . Hayley 's missing . You 're worried about her . I prefer to know the whereabouts of my enemies . Besides , Hayley has a history of taking what 's mine . No . You 're afraid she 's truly lost . I 'll need the best connection to Hayley . You 'll have to wake hope . So any progress on the killer 's profile ? Listen . I know Vincent said that I could help , but you should probably consult someone with a little more experience . Yeah . True . I 've seen you around town before with Klaus Mikaelson , a mysterious philanthropistartist with no past on record . Is he a friend or a patient ? You know , I think we should call it . Cami . I 'm not allowed to discuss my clients . It is . But after Vincent brought you around , I did further research . For example , your uncle Kieran 's death last year , that autopsy report was just full of plot holes . He had a heart attack . Perfectly rational explanation . There 's always a perfectly rational explanation . Your family has a whole century of strange deaths , unexplainable behavior , grave robberies , beheadings , missing persons , police reports with entire sections blacked out . Whenever there 's a problem in the quarter , there 's an O'Connell either causing it or cleaning it up . Are you accusing me of something ? No . I just think your whole good catholic family thing is a cover . I just have n't figured out what you 're covering yet , but I will .    I ca n't find her . There 's ... nothing . It 's like she does n't exist , or sh ... Or she 's dead . No . No . Please . Please . You need to listen to me . Please .    Oh ! Ohh ! Oh , Klaus , the chains . Please . I know you do n't want to help me , but Hayley can be used against Klaus . She 's the only one that he truly fears .   Ohh ! Freya , please ! Please do the spell again ! I ca n't go a month with ... agh ! Unh ! Davina : Please , please . I need you to listen to me . Agh ! Ohh . It stopped . Aah ! Aah !  Aah !   My contacts will get back to me if they have any information about a wolf matching your description . You 're going to need Niklaus ' blood for that wound . Just FYI . I 'm sure he 'll respond favorably once the mother of his child has been ... Recovered . Oh , feel free to have a drink . She 's not dead , just mouthy . So you say that you 're in conflict with those of my sire line . Am I to assume that the lord Tristan Du Martel is up to his usual tricks ? This is no quarrel , Elijah . We are on the brink of war . Tristan knows that if he kills Klaus he will eliminate all his enemies . And so wait . By this logic , am I to assume that I am your ultimate target ? If I kill you , then I trade all of the money , the women , the jets all for an eternity on the run from Nik and Rebekah . Leave this city . No one needs your protection . The white oak was destroyed . We can not be killed . You 're wrong . Talk to Nik . He 's seen the prophecies . Visions of darkness surround your family . You are not immune to death , Elijah , and you do n't seem particularly fazed . Well , I 'm no stranger to death , young Lucien . After all , you 've abandoned your eternal effort to save Nik 's soul . What 's left for the legendary Elijah Mikaelson without that single motivation ? We got a problem . Marcel : 11 bodies , a lot of pissed off loved ones . They thought it was a vampire thing , but all my guys were accounted for at the abattoir last night . Where 's my mom ? Where is she ? Oh , no ! No , no !  Shh . I taught you better than to leave your leftovers in the streets , my streets . You 'll have to elaborate , mate . Two bodies were found sporting rather memorable lacerations . Are you exorcising your demons by carving up the innocents of New Orleans . Ha ha ! Your family 's full of unfounded accusations today , and if I was the culprit , why would you care ? We used to make fantastic messes together . There is a delicate balance in this city . There are rules . Ahh . And people you care about . Come see me . I 'll give you my blood in exchange for your word that these killings will stop . I 'm afraid your family dog missed the mark friend . Barely a scratch . No venom reached the skin . You listen carefully , friend . My city has enjoyed months of relative peace . If that peace is any way disrupted , the next gruesome murder will be yours . Heh . Now there 's the Klaus I know .  Can I get you some water or something ? Let me out . It 's dawn . I have n't turned back yet . It does n't make any sense . I need to find Hayley . I can feel the curse in your blood . Something 's restraining it , but you could transition at any moment . Where the hell is that bastard ? Versailles witches , this is an unbearable tragedy . Whoever did this was strong and , for all we know , might return . If you follow my rules , I promise to keep you safe . Nothing like this will ever happen to you . Not again . Hayley , what happened ? Klaus : Hayley . Come to apologize for all your transgressions ? Do you have any idea what you have taken from me ? Aah ! The very thing you sought to take from me ... The chance to raise our daughter . Your punishment fits your crime . Your family was ruining her life . My family saved her life while you were off playing hide-and-seek in the forest ! Unh ! Unh ! Aah ! God . Let me go . He 'll kill her ! He 'll kill you ! There 's a very short list of people who 've tried to take hope away from me , and you 're the only one left breathing . Yes , yes . Your precious pack , that family you chose over us , and in doing so , you chose over hope . Is that what you were planning on telling her when she got older and asked for me , that I abandoned her ? My parents left me ! Yours turned their backs on you ! Look at us now , Klaus ! Aah ! Niklaus ! She deserves something better than what we had , and all I have ever wanted for her is something better ! Fight back ! Fight back ! Ohh . She 's walking . When did she start walking ? I missed it . I missed everything .  Hayley . What happened ? Is the curse broken ? I 'll explain later . We 're safe for now . Klaus : Good for you . I 'll have your bedroom made up . The only way that I will stay under your roof is if I 'm in a coffin . Welcome to a 21st century custody battle . Moms win them now . Elijah : If I may . The apartments across the street have recently been renovated . I might pay a visit to the management . The fact that hope will never be out of earshot should assuage your incessant paranoia . So we are to listen as my daughter is raised by savages ? Because everyone here is so damn civilized ? Brother , you created the problem . This might well be the solution . Put the place in Jackson 's name . Klaus wo n't be invited in . You 're gon na need to take care of those bodies discreetly . I know . Keep everything covered up , keep it out of the papers . Davina . Tell me you did n't do this . You 're the one who told me I had to use a sign of force . Against the one who went after you . I did not suggest a massacre . I learned that from you . Guess who I learned it from . You 're not gon na get the better of Klaus by becoming him . All right ? You need a break . Get out , live a little , have some fun . Vincent should have never gotten you into this . You 're too young to have that kind of blood on your hands . I 'm a french quarter witch . I was born with blood on my hands ! And you 're not supposed to be in the cemetery , Marcel . Aah !   Are you ok ? I 'm fine . Come in . Jackson 's gathering the pack to tell them to go back to their families , what 's left of them . Ahem . You should be quite comfortable . Thank you for this . You know , there was a moment at the bonfire last year when I thought we would be ok , that hope could be raised by a real family . For the first time , I was happy . I recovered them after you turned . I thought only of you . Every day , I fought for your return , and ... Searching for a way . You were not forgotten . Those remains used to be my mom . I 'm so sorry . Spare me . She went after you . We had our differences , but ... Look . I 'm gon na find out how this happened , and I 'm gon na expose you . Then you 'll be shunned , unable to practice , exiled from the city . Basically ... I 'm gon na erase you . Ahem . Oh . Come on in . The woodbine sessions : ? walking shadows . Tracing silhouettes ? Not quite as luxurious as the airstream , but ... Eh , we 'll make it a good home , Hayley . Hope will be surrounded by people who love her . She 'll be happy , you 'll be happy . ? Snapped beneath my step . I 'm still walking out ... ? Ohh ... ? However I go , oh , I know ? These were found in the junkyard . ? I go on ? Huh . ? I go on . I go on . I go on . I go on ? Well , you saved us again . Mmm . For now . Davina 's not gon na let us forget she 's the reason why we 're here . Our freedom comes with a price . Everything does in this town , but the worst is over , and so just for today , why do n't you let me take care of you for a change , huh ? Ok . Just this once . ? I go on . I go on . I go on . Standing in the shadows . I go on . I go on . I go on . Standing in the shadows ? Staking out my apartment now . You 're not an amateur . I finished up the end of that video you were watching . Lucien Castle . Highly motivating . Feeling like my best self already . So he fits the profile , right ? What , narcissistic personality disorder ? I should report you . You definitely should , yet you have n't because you know I was right about your family . You 're not a suspect , Cami . I 'm actually looking out for you . I think you 're mixed up in something much bigger than you realize . Trust me . I realize . Woman on radio : Possible serial killer in the quarter . Wait . Turn up your radio . Man on radio : While police refuse to release information , sources allege that a manhunt is on for a possible serial killer . Two violently mutilated bodies entirely drained of blood have been recovered . How the hell did they know about the blood ? Hmm . You 're welcome for the tip . You 're new . What is it ? I received some unsettling information . From Lucien Castle . I do n't trust the source , but I ... trust you . If you fed on this prophetic witch , her blood is still in your system . If there 's a weapon that can kill you , we need to know .  Freya ? Stop !  It 's true . You have a terrible shadow over you . Rebekah , too . If this prophecy is fulfilled , you will all fall . One by friend , one by foe , and one ... By family .  You 're distracted . My time with you is limited , Tristan . I 'm thinking only of you , sister . I 'm told there was an incident here yesterday . Well , as I recall , I was awaiting your visit when I received a letter informing me that you were unavailable . Can you imagine my dismay ? I had so hoped you would handle it better . " Well , it 's time . I 'm fine . Let me out ! You know I ca n't do that while you 're in this state . I will miss you , though , my sweet Aurora . Miss me ? You 're leaving ? No . No ! Why ? Aah ! Tristan , no . No , please . - Shh . - Please . - I 'll be better . - Shh . Please take me with you . - Shh . - Take me with you . Shh . It 's all right . It 's all right . Tristan , please . Increase her dosage while I 'm gone . She may be a danger to others , to herself . Tell her I 'll be back soon , and I 'll bring her a gift , a lovely little souvenir ... From New Orleans . 
@@5240441 All right , Donna put your chair here . I wan na get Steven 's attention , and with you next to me I 'll look like a tiny porcelain doll . Y'know Jackie , some people actually find me to be of normal height . Sure if they 're green and jolly . - I ca n't take it . Watching Donna lie out , knowing she 's gon na go to college and I have to stay here , She 's so , so ... Juicy . My Juicy . Well I 'm not gon na stay here locked in the house just cause Jackie looks ... ridiculously hot in that bathing suit . - Later Forman . - Bye bye juicy . Ladies . Ladies bodies . I wish someone would rub lotion on my shoulders . Think they 're getting a little red . Yeah , you should be careful . Looks like you 're starting to scab . Oh , that 's a burn about a burn . That 's a second degree burn ! Y'know Jackie , I think maybe Hyde 's moved on . No , no , no . Okay ladies . All these sound waves are interfering with my sunrays . Let 's tan . Alright , I 'm gon na need you to lotion me up , darling , but only rub where you can see . No roaming ! Hey , Mom , Dad , I have something I wan na tell you . I 've decided not to move away . - What ? I 'm gon na stay and put off college for just a little while or at least until you 're well enough to go back to work . - My baby , my baby , my baby . Mom okay , this is actually kind of embarrassing . You 're actually really hurting me , yeah . You mean I 've been waiting eighteen years for you to get your butt out of this house , and now you 're staying ? I signed over my pay check to you . I want you to go buy yourself something pretty . - It might I just had a heart attack . Speaking of which , I just found this in the garbage . Why would you throw away the list of all the food the doctor said we could n't have in the house ? Kitty did you look at that list ? If I had known what I was coming home to after my heart attack , I would 've walked straight into that bright light and never looked back . Oh come on , it ca n't be that bad . I 'll do it with you . Cause what 's good for the goose , is good for the gander . Actually , Mom , Dad 's the gander . The male goose . So it would be what 's good for the gander is good for the goose . Let 's take a gander at what you 're giving up with the gander . That 's how you do that . Potato chips , other salty snacks . Alcoholic beverages . - Okay , that doctor 's a quack . God , it 's gon na be so hard going off to college without you . But we 'll see each other on the weekends right ? Well you say that now , but then there 's that weekend when you call home and say you have to study but I here Moose , the place kicker in the background , asking if you want another shot of tequila . Eric , that would never happen . I would never date a place kicker , it 's Quarterback or nothing for me . The more I think about leaving you , the sadder I get . And the sadder I get , the more I wan na be with you . Right now . - Now ? Well yeah , I ... Whoa , alright this is great , it 'll be like completely spontaneous , like I just ... Why are you talking ? - I 'm sorry , I ... Dude if something 's crunchy , you should really have that looked at . There 's no time my friend , I have a distraught neighbour girl to attend to . Dry your eyes baby , the lovin 's on its way ! Toe ring . - Oh , Fez you like ? Yeah , got a toe ring . - On the little piggy that went to the market . Steven what do you think ? - Ca n't resist toe ring . Whatever . I have all sorts of things now that I did n't have when we were going out . Toe ring , tan lines , a tattoo . - You do n't have a tattoo , you 're bluffing . Do you have a tattoo ? Well we 're not going out , so I guess you 'll never know . " Oh , baby , I love you so much . " Were you doing Jackie ? - Yes , yes . Why am I even thinking about her ? Man , she 's like Tahiti . It 's warm and it 's beautiful and you wan na go there , but when you do you get bit by a mosquito and you get malaria and you 're sick for the rest of your life . She 's obviously not over you either . She 's practically putting on a show to get your attention . Just imagine it . I love to dance . Okay the doctor wins . Eric and I boxed up all the liquor . Man , look at all this , it 's like Dean Martin exploded . There were bottles in the liquor cabinet , the dining room hutch , my Mom 's nightstand . Oh no , no , that 's for polishing furniture . - Mom , there 's lipstick on it . It 's just your luck Forman . I mean avoid . Do homework next to . Pray near . Come on ! Yeah , it 's gon na be pretty boring around here . You know what you should do ? Go to college . Mom would it be too much to ask for Dad to be grateful that I 'm staying ? Honey , we 're all going through hard times . You 're giving up your future , I 'm giving up my Schnapps . Let 's not compare our pain . Hey , sorry I 'm late . Donna was really upset about leaving , so I had to comfort her in a bedular way . It turns out if I get her sad , she gives it away like goldfish at a freakin ' carnival . Eric , I think you may have found a secret open sesame to sex . Make the lady cry . Perhaps I should try that with my wife . " Laurie here 's a dead cat , now do me . That usually does it . Actually I only ever got as far as ' Hi ' . Fez , I did it with your wife ! God I have so much power over Donna now , it 's like I know how Obi-Wan Kenobi feels . " These are n't the droidsyou 're looking for . " Man , I wish I could do it with Donna in a land speeder on . That would be so awesome . Hey , Steven , check out my new super sexy tattoo . Hard to keep your hands off , huh ? Steven ! Sorry , here 's your tattoo back . I 'll take that . - Steven , why are you being so difficult ? Jackie , no amount of tattoos or toe rings , are gon na fix the fact that you have a lot to apologise for . You 're the one who should apologise . - Then I guess we 're not getting back together . I guess we 're not . I hope she gets it on her hienie . Jackie , it really bugs me that you and Hyde are n't back together , so as the man who used to pleasure you endlessly , I feel it is my obligation to step in and fix this , cause when I 'm a cop I 'm gon na have to deal with domestic cases like this all the time . And the good news is , he 'll have guns . Yeah , this is gon na be a piece of cake . Y'know they should have put me in charge of Vietnam , I would have had those people making out in a week . Wow , Donna , that might be the last time you 'll ever get to see Kelso make an even bigger mess of a problem . Yeah I 'm gon na miss that . And I 'm gon na miss you . Yeah ... What ? - Nothing , it just could be the last time that you and I stand beside the Vista Cruiser . I just waxed her she 's all slippy slidy . Donna this might be the last time I bring you your toothbrush . That 's not my toothbrush . Might be the last time ... I bring you the wrong toothbrush . Hello , darling . I see you are washing your unmentionables . Yeah , do you know what gets out grass stains and Kailua ? Anyways ... I was thinking how sad you must be considering the mess you made of your life . With all that sadness , do you not also get needy ? Y'know , I sorta do . - Ali Baba , the treasure is mine ! I 'm gon na go see if Carlos is home . That Carlos is one lucky SOB to have a wife like mine . Like that time that you told me to eat that stuff , and I did n't know what it was , and then you licked your lips , and you rubbed you stomach and you were like ' Mmm it 's really good Kelso ' and then I ate it and then I wished I had n't of done that . Yeah , well , maybe with Jackie I was sort of impetuous and maybe a little rash . Now see , that 's something that Jackie ought a know . Hyde say 's that he was sort of infectious and he has a rash . What ? - I 'm just telling you what he said . All right , look , Michael , Steven 's the one who messed up the relationship . He thought you and I were together but he was just wrong . He fabricated the whole mess . - Well somebody ought to make that clear . That ca n't be what she said . - It 's word for word , man . Kelso , would you get outta here ? - What , I 'm helping . You 're making me wan na kick your ass . That better be the rash talking . Busted , mister . - You 're like a damn cat . I 'm gon na make you wear a bell . Bad health in a can , that 's what that is . The doctor said he wants nothing like that around here , and I agree . All it takes is a little bit of will power , Red . Even though you used to do something without thinking , you just have to grab a hold of those thoughts . Can I get you a refill there ? Well there 's a lesson for you . You 're welcome . Oh hey , listen , son . It means a lot to your mother , you staying here and helping out the family . And as for me I ... There . Yeah , the lawn thanks you for all that mowing you 're gon na do . You 're welcome , Dad . - Yeah , well . All right , we 're both men here . Oh , God . - What 's wrong ? Nothing it 's just this could be the last time that ... you and I watch Gilligan get hit on the head by the Skipper . Eric , the more we talk about me going away , the sadder you get . And being with you so much lately has been great , but afterwards ... well you always used to look a little bit ashamed and I mean now you just seem depressed . Oh no , no , I 'm not depressed , Donna , you are depressed . Okay , let 's do this . All this last time stuff , have you been saying that just for sex ? What ? Have I ... what ? This is not the one you 're angry with . You 're disgusting . Y'know Fez , this whole thing with Hyde and Jackie is stupid . They both wan na be together , and they would in a second f they just thought that other one had said I 'm sorry . Eureka , Fez , Eureka ! I 'm one step ahead of you my friend . - Yeah I 'll just lie to both of them , and tell them the other one said I 'm sorry . - I thought we were going to pan for gold . Okay , here we go , let 's make up . All right , look , Steven , I heard what you said . Yeah , I heard what ... wait a minute , you heard what I said ? Yeah , Michael told me , and just so you know I 'm sorry too . Too ? No , you 're not sorry too , you 're sorry one , I 'm sorry too . Wait , what , no Michael said that ... - Yeah , he said that ... So nothing 's changed then ? - Guess no . Forget this . - Okay , enough . Look , you guys , who cares who apologised first ?

There 's got to be something you can do . I can only think of one thing , but it 's pretty drastic . Anything . ? I wonder why ? I wonder why ..... ? Look who thinks she 's Eydie Gorm ? . Eh ... you know , she 's got a nice set of pipes for a shrink , huh ? Beautiful . ? ... just what 's the matter ... ? Hey , guys , listen up for a second , will you ? Fellas ? Hey , Lilith !  : Lilith ! Lilith , cut it , please . ? ... on my shoulder . Sam , what 's going on ? I was enjoying that . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Always leave them wanting more . Guys , listen up for a second . Will you , please ? Uh , when Rebecca comes in , she 's , uh , probably not going to be feeling too good , so just take it easy on her . All right ? What 's the problem , Sam ? Well , she called off the whole wedding . Get out . SAM : No , it 's true . I went over there last night . Good morning , everyone ! Jonathan , thank God you 're here . I 'm in such a rush . Now , I do n't have any time for those curlers , so you 're going to have to do your trick with the blow-dryer . Yeah , Sam , she 's in agony . Ordinarily , Sam , people do n't deal with depression by putting on a wedding dress and acting giddy . Except maybe Clavin . Men do n't get giddy . Yeah , right , nice . This is crazy . I got to go find out what 's happened . Way back on my head or up forward like this , whichever way we decide . Hi , Sam . What are you doing ? I know , I know . I know you were n't here last night . You were at your apartment . I was there with you . Remember ? Oh , do n't be silly , Sam . I would n't let anybody in that apartment . It 's a mess . Oh , my God , she does n't ... you do n't remember , do you ? Excuse us . We 're working here . Dear , I 'll need an extension cord for the dryer . Oh , sure . Hey , yo , pal . Listen , I do n't care what you 're doing here . Th-This happens to be the most important thing that ... You use this gel ? I tried this . It just dries my hair out . Are you touching it during the critical drying stage ? What do you think I am , a rookie ? You guys , I have my new wedding dress and now all I need is something old , something borrowed , and something blue ... I want you to know what a great honor it would be for me to sing at your wedding . Okay . Really ? Cool ! Jonathan , I found the extension cord . We 'll have to finish down at City Hall . SAM : Honey , now , wait a minute . We were in your apartment together . Do n't you remember ? You came on to me . You said that you could n't possibly marry Robin because in your entire life you never had anyone as exciting as me . My ! Someone 's full of himself on my wedding day . Well , Sam , do n't just stand there . Yeah , you 're right ; I got to find something to jog her memory . No , no , you got to help me get this machine in the car . I 've got a gig . Test , testing . One , two . A-one , two , three , four . Yeah , boy , City Hall - - the civil servant 's home away from home . Yeah , you know , whenever the job gets me down , Norm , I just come around here and roam the halls . Hey , pal , I thought we told you never to come back here . How many times we got to throw you out ? Look , I-I 'm with the wedding . Is that true , sir ? Uh , yes , yeah , yeah , it is ... but , uh , stick around .  : Oh , great , I 'm not too late . Where 's Rebecca ? She 's in there . What 's all this junk ? Oh , this is , uh , just some of her stuff . I broke into her apartment . And you passed up her stereo equipment for this ? Stay a bartender , Sam . No , no , no . Hey ... honey , Rebecca ? Hi . Sam , is n't that mine ? Yeah , you bet it is . Here , open the pizza box . Look at that , huh ? Some pizza with Canadian bacon and pineapple and ... look at your robe here with Canadian bacon and pineapple . Huh ? Now , does this all remind you of something ?  : Oh , God , oh , God , I just remembered ! Oh , yes ! Oh , God , thank you ! Th ... I thought I was going crazy . Yes , I remembered I left my garter in my car . Would you get it for me , please ? Well , sure , but ...  I do n't know why people get so nutty during weddings . Hey , compared to some cultures , we got it easy . Take the Wanobis in Central Africa . Now , there 's a ceremony . Uh , this man 's bothering me . We 're talking ... Why do n't you come with me , pal ? We 're going to that little room downstairs ? Yes , yes . Hey , Rebecca , this is ... wow , nice hair . I brought you some samples I had in the car . Oh , yeah , thanks . Give us a yoo-hoo if you like them . Honey . Honey ... Sam , where 's my garter ? Oh , I sent Woody after it . Listen , sweetheart , we 've been friends for a long time , right ? Right . I hope you understand that what I 'm doing , I 'm doing for you . I 'm doing it out of our , our friendship over the last four years . I 'm doing it because I care . Okay , Sam , go ahead . Snap out of it , will you ? ! Let the fog lift here ! You said that you did n't love the guy ! What the hell are you doing ? ! Woody , what am I going to do with these ? Well , they may not look so great , but they , they 'll probably hold up your stockings . Of course , they might leave a mark . Great , and what am I supposed to do after the ceremony ? Throw a tire iron to the bridesmaids ? All right , I 'll be right back . SAM : Oh , hell , I give up . You know , do what you want . Marry Robin . I hope you 'll be very happy , waking up every morning to ...  : ... " Good morning , Rebecca . " Good morning , Rebecca .  Darling , I know it 's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding , but , well , I 've , uh , lost my fortune ; I 've been to prison . That was a wonderful present , Robin . Well , I thought it would be sweet if , uh , I could find some way to relive that memory on our wedding day , and now that I 'm finally unchained ... ? Oh ... my love  ? My darlin ' . I 've hungered for your touch ... ? My God ! It 's the other Righteous Brother ! Bobby Hatfield . Oh , no , no , to me he 'll always be the other Righteous Brother . ? ... so slowly ... I 'm , uh , ready to start . ? And time ... Who 's this bozo ? I 'm Bobby Hatfield . Yes , Robin gave him to me as a present . He 's going to sing at my wedding . Is n't that wonderful ? Oh . So he 's in and I 'm out ? Well , fine . So you can cut out my heart again . Young man , would you make sure everyone gets seated ? Oh , yes , Father . I 'm not a priest . I 'm a government official . Oh . I 'm sorry , Your Honor . No , son , that would be a judge . I 'm a Justice of the Peace . Well , then , what should I call you ? You can call me Ed . Well , it looks like I ... I wo n't be singing after all . But Rebecca has graciously invited me to push the buttons for Mr . Bobby Hatfield . Let 's see . What number is " Unchained Melody ? " U-14 . Yes , master .  ? Oh , my love ? My darling That 's a lovely song . ? I hunger That 's because we 're close to the speaker . ? For your touch ... Music is perhaps one of the most evocative of the associative stimuli . ? And I ... Some fascinating data-gathering was done in 1957 in Brussels , when the ... ? So slowly ... They always leave when I get to the interesting part . ? And time ...  It 's okay . It 's her other favorite song . ? We 've got tonight ... ? She sang it to me just last night . BOBBY : ? Who needs tomorrow . Let 's make it last , babe . Let 's find a way ? I know I 've heard this song before . ? Turn out the lights I just ca n't remember when . ? Come on and hold my hand It seems like it was ... ? We got tonight , honey Oh , God ! ? Why do n't you stay . Why do n't you stay . Turn out the light ... Rebecca , this is insanity ! I have fishing licenses to pass out . Uh , well , there 's got to be another key someplace , Ed . Second floor . Security . Oh . You know , I just do n't understand this . She 's always seemed so stable before . Did you two ever really talk ? Hey , guy , what 's , uh ... what 's going on ? Did I miss much ? Uh , no , not much . Looks like the wedding might be off . What are you talking about ? After I spent all that time tying tin cans to the back of Robin 's car and spraying it with shaving cream , tying toilet paper to it ? Robin does n't have a car . Oh . It just irritates me . I mean , I was all ready to sing at this wedding , and then you walk in the door . Well , naturally , you 're the better singer . You 're a professional . Really ? Uh , how long have you felt this way ? Then again , I could be wrong . Boy , I could sure go for a taste of this cake . We really do n't need this congratulations anymore . No . Not if they 're not getting married . Hey . Wow , we 've really kind of made a mess of this top part here . CARLA : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , well , we 'll just take out the whole layer . Okay . CARLA : Yeah ! Are you ready to go on with the ceremony ? No . Not yet . I need to work a few things out . I-I need somebody to talk to . Anybody . I-I ... I really need some help !  REBECCA : Not Paul ! I ca n't help somebody who does n't want to be helped . You okay , honey ? No . I need time to think . I have to talk to somebody about this . Did you try talking to Paul ?  No , I did not talk to Paul ! Well , he 's always helped me . He 's got a super outlook on life . You know , when I heard that song starting to play , suddenly , it all came back to me . Everything that I said last night . Oh ! Oh , God , Sam ! Why is this happening to me ? ! Because you do n't love him . I know . I did love him . Well , m-maybe you loved him when he was rich , but that 's different now . What ? ! What are you saying ? Are you saying that I only cared about Robin when he had money ? Well , it 's the truth , is n't it ? How dare you tell me that I only loved him for his money ! I am not that shallow . I am not that superficial . I am not that creepy ! You think that I only loved him for his money . Robin ! Ed ! Bobby ! Hit it !  ? Oh , my love ... Cliff , let 's try to put the cake back together . Forget the cake . How are we going to get these presents re-wrapped . Hunger for your touch ? A long lonely time ...  Under the bylaws of the Massachusetts Fish and Game Commission ... Oops . Sorry . That 's ... that 's all right , Ed . We 've , um ... We 've prepared our own vows . ED : Oh . Go ahead . R-Rebecca ? I only loved you for your money . REBECCA : I 'm hateful . I am the most awful person that I have ever met in my life . I do n't deserve to live . Carla , what am I gon na do ? You could throw yourself into the Charles . I do n't think so . How about heaving yourself off the Prudential Building ? That 's a 52-story drop . You hit the pavement , they 'll be scraping you up with a spatula , just like they do in the cartoons ! Oh ! You know , Paul was right . You ca n't help somebody who does n't want to be helped . Aw , honey . Oh . What 's the bad news ? Well , the bad news is Robin 's outside , and he wants to talk to you .  Oh , my God . What 's the good news ? I lied about the good news . Will you see him ? Hey , will you look at that ! Your hair still retained its bounce ! I mean , that 's something , is n't it ? Rebecca ? What 's going on ? Have I done something wrong ? Oh , no . Robin , it 's not you . It 's me . I do n't understand . Oh , I ca n't say this to your face . Please turn around . Oh , gee , you 've got a cute butt . Robin , I ca n't say this to your butt . Turn around again . I do n't love you , Robin . I thought you were the one who was going to stand by me . I thought I was your sweet baby . No . You was my rich baby . All right , so , you loved me for my money . Well , what if I were to tell you that I had $6 million stashed away in a money belt before my arrest ? Now , would that make any difference ? No . No , it would n't . I see .  Well ... What 's that ? $6 million . Farewell , Rebecca . Honey , I hope you do n't mind , but I was listening outside . I ca n't believe you turned down all that cash ! You 're changing , honey . That was the bravest thing I 've ever seen you do !  : I thought he was bluffing , Sam ! Just let me go ! No ! No ! No ! 
@@5241041 There . That should do it . - Can you hear me ? - Huh ? - Can you hear me ? ! - Huh ? You 'll be all right . Okay , put ' em up . I 'm not going to hurt you . What is the point ? I can hardly fight off a cold . I 'm just wasting your time . Fighting is n't just physical , Iolaus . It 's about outsmarting your opponent . I mean , most battles are won before the first punch is even thrown . So , you 're saying ... I can use my head . Yeah . Great . I can do that . - Now I 'm gon na take a swing at you . - Okay . You 're gon na block it just like I showed you . Block . Right . Oh , darling ! Hey , look at ... Sorry about that . You were supposed to block it ... Yeah , I know . I got distracted . Oh , they look happy , though , do n't they ? Yeah . You can come out now . A rose by any other name would smell as sweet ... , ... and honey , I 'm the sweetest . Hello , Aphrodite . Roll up your tongue . That 's my sister . Sorry . Long time no see , baby bro . And you , Curly from the swirly . Nice haircut . How you diggin ' life on our side of the vortex ? Well , now that you ask ... Glad to hear it . Herc , have you seen the Tribera Ruins ? There are n't any ruins in Tribera . Well , there 's gon na be if you do n't jam on over there . Heard there 's , like , a major mud slide heading their way . I 'd go with you , but I just had a mud bath yesterday . Yeah , well , I can see your hands are tied . Hey , you want me to go with you ? No , thanks . Could you do me a favor ? Iolaus is n't really adjusting well to this world . You talkin ' to me ? ! Say no more . Let me take him under my wing , show him the ropes . Actually , I want you to leave him completely alone . I do n't need him any more confused than he already is . Okay . Here is where you , like , totally owe me an apology . I 'm the goddess of love ! What could possibly go wrong ? This is what I 'm saying . What 's not to like ? He comes from a good family . Daddy , he ca n't keep his tentacles to himself ! So he 's a hopeless romantic . You know how writers are . Just because he spills ink all over the place does n't make him a writer . You 're marrying Cedric . That 's final . Father , he 's a squid ! Well , nobody 's perfect ! I 've never even left Coral Bay ... , ... but your place is here with your family and with people who need you ! Now , you 're marrying the squid , and that 's that ! - Life 's a beach , ai n't it ? - Who are you ? Someone who knows just how it feels to be a big fish in a little pond . It gets kind of claustrophobic , does n't it ? Yeah . Ever disobey dear old dad before ? Well , no , but I ... But there 's a first time for everything . Why , your Romeo could be beach side , and you 'd never know it . Are you really gon na let Triton stop you from finding your dream man ? - Maybe you 're right . - Of course I am . And I happen to have a first-class ticket down lover 's lane with your name on it . There 's just one little catch . Ready ? Wait ! Wait ! Here goes . Hold on , hold on ! Have you ever done this before ? No . But there 's a first time for everything , all right ? Now this is it . Okay . Just ... Just one more thing . What if I wan na go back ? To what ? To life with Mr . Tentacles in a three-bedroom shell with a pink coral fence and a two-seahorse garage ? Since you put it that way , I 'm ready . - Wait . I almost forgot . - What is the holdup ? Get wet and you 'll have quite a " tail " to tell . - Pun intended . - Got it . Forgive me , Father , for what I 'm about to do ... , ... but I 'm not a little guppy anymore . Thank you , Discord ! A word of advice : learn to walk before you run . Good thinking . Hook , line and sinker . Only one man dared to challenge their power : Hercules . Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen , a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart . He journeyed the Earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother , Hera , the all-powerful queen of the gods . But wherever there was evil , wherever an innocent would suffer , there would be ... Hercules ! How 's that for gratitude ? I offer to keep you company and he insults me . My own brother . Can you believe it ? Well , I 'm sure he did n't mean anything by it . What 's with you ? Why ca n't you look at me ? It 's just I 'm not used to seeing so much of you . Well , get used to it , sweet pea , ' cause I travel light . Goddess of love , huh ? What 's it like ? It 's pretty cool . I get to travel a lot , I 'm my own boss ... No . I 'd be happy to help you out ! - Oh , baby ! - No ! Aphrodite , get her off ! - Ah , that 's your job . - I ca n't breathe ! Hi . Creep ! Not your type , huh ? Well , how about him ? Aphrodite , I do n't want to seem ungrateful , but ... - ... that did n't feel like love . - You mean " love " . - Yeah . - I thought you meant " love " . Oh , you 're so cute ! A real , old-fashioned romantic . I like you , Iolaus . With a little help , someone else will too . Appreciate that , but ... I want ... to fall in love . I do n't want you to drop it on me . No problem . Excuse me , sir ? Hi . I 'm new in town and I was wondering ... , ... - Shameful ! Simply shameful ! Oramus , come here ! You 've got ta see this ! What a show ! Not much of a novelty . Get your halibut here ! This place ca n't be good for my pores . Iolaus ! Thank the gods you 've come ! Where 's Hercules ? He 'll be back in a moment . Never mind . I 'm sure you can handle them yourself . - Them who ? - Them them . Brutus 's goons . He sends them out to collect his so-called property tax . If we do n't pay , they start breaking bones ! From the look of things , you 've got some very brave people around here . Not really . Even if we pay , they still beat us . Oh ... okay . Well , seeing as it does n't make any difference what we do , bye ! Wait ! Do n't you see ? This is your big chance ! If you beat these guys up , you 'll have your pick of any chick in town . What good 'll that do if I have to carry my head round on a date ? Excuse me . Say , what 's wrong with this picture ? I got it . He ai n't wearing ' a cast . Guys , could we talk about this ? That ai n't gon na be easy when you 're spittin ' teeth ! Yeah , good point . I can see you got the brains in the family . And what did you get , sir ? Ah , I see . The liver . Well , I should be running away now , but my feet wo n't cooperate . Let me guess . You 're just giving ' em a false sense of security , right ? No . Actually , I 'm just trying to savor my last few moments on Earth . - But I thought you knew how to fight ! - What gave you that impression ? - I saw you fighting with Hercules ! Make a fist ! Let 's get ' I'm ! - Did I do that ? - Yeah ! Not so hard ! Oh , do n't be such a baby . If it hurts you , it hurts them . This is great . Let 's get outta here ! - He 's a one-man army ! - Save yourselves ! Yeah ! All right ! - What a workout ! - You 're telling me . I 'm still getting palpitations from all the humiliation ! Oh , buck up , little camper . They think you 're a hero ! Yeah ? Too bad I know I 'm not . - Who is that ? - His name 's Iolaus . Iolaus , huh ? What a catch ! My , my , what a pretty little fishy . Thank you , Brutus . Pretty enough to eat . Please , do n't eat me , Brutus . Do n't what ? Eat me . If you insist ... Playing with yourself again , Brutus ? Discord . Discord . - Discor ... ! There , there , my little potato head . - I did n't mean to yell at you . - I may be a big guy ... , ... but I have feelings too , you know ? Of course you do . And you know how much I need you , sweetums . You do ? See , I ca n't get too directly involved here . Poseidon is Triton 's brother , and if he found out what I have in mind for his glorious oceans ... , ... he 'd fillet me faster than you can say " fish sticks " . But , ai n't you already involved ? I mean , you did give the fish-girl legs . She thinks I did her a favor . Now , if we can just keep her on land until the sunset ... , ... the seas will be ours forever ! But I ... still get to beat people to a bloody pulp . Of course . Terrible ! He was like ... like a human tornado ! One man did this to you all ? Hercules ... No . No ! The other one . The man he travels with ! The court jester ? Please . He could n't hit water if he fell off a boat . There 's something fishy going on around here . Some hero . Wait 'll they find out I 'm a fraud . Excuse me , sir . You sure you got the right guy ? I just wanted to tell you that ... I think you 're very brave . Oh , thanks , but actually , I 'm ... A little ... tongue-tied . I think I love you . Miss ... It 's not that I do n't wish I was the kind of guy that could take advantage of this situation , but ... , ... what you 're feeling is n't love . - Aphrodite made you feel like this . - Who ? Aphrodite . Goddess of love . So where exactly are you from ? Oh , it does n't matter . My home 's a whole other world away . So 's mine . To tell you the truth , I felt like a slave there . Really ? But I 'm trying to let go of my old life and get on with my new one . - What 's your name ? - Nautica . Nautica ... Fish heads ! Fresh fish heads ! But shnookie-lumps , I swear we 're just friends ! I catch you with your arms around a naked woman in our living room and you expect me to believe you ? She 's a nudist ! She was choking ! I 'm so sorry I did n't believe you . That 's all right , my darling . I did n't believe me either . Well ... , ... if it is n't the multi-talentless and easily inflatable Aphrodite . What do you know ? It 's the goddess of skank . Here to defend your title at the kielbasa-swallowing contest ? Take that ! So what if I did ? Do n't tell me those gorillas work for you . I 'm warning you , Aphrodite . This is none of your business . Skip town , sister , before things get ugly . Oops ! Too late . Have you looked in the mirror lately ? - Enough ! - Fashion victim ! Blonde ! - I love you . - I love you too . Fresh fruit right here ! Observe . - " Orange " you glad you met me ? - Let 's water these fish . What is it ? Nautica , what 's wrong ? The water . It 's a new dress , and I did n't want to get it wet . - Okay . - Iolaus ... , ... when you left your world ... , ... how did you know it was the right thing to do ? Good man ! I mean , what kind of father wo n't let his own daughter see the world for herself ? The kind that loves her so much , he 's afraid to let her go ? You know what ? You 're the first man I 've ever met who talked to me and not at me . Can I ask you something ? Can I kiss you again ? Oh , no ! What is it ? Something I ate ? Cousin Abernathy ! What have they done to you ? ! Nautica , are you all right ? Sure ! It 's just that I ... I used to have a fish . And it looked exactly , exactly like this one . And I called it ... Cousin Abernathy . Would you excuse me ? I 'll be right back . - What 's the rumpus , Curly ? - Aphrodite ! Hey ! I expect a little more enthusiasm from my fans . I 'm sorry ... and we have everything in common , and just once I thought she 'd like me for me . Hey , I did n't have anything to do with it . You mean ... , ... you did n't sprinkle her with whatever it is you sprinkle people with ? Okay , now I 'm confused . I thought you did n't want me getting involved . No ! No , that 's great , that 's great ! That means she ... she really thinks I 'm brave , and ... No , she does n't like me for me . She likes me for the me that she thinks is me . The me that is n't me , I mean . You know what I mean ? Chill , Curly . This is , like , a golden opportunity . When those goons come back to rip the flesh off your face ... , ... you can stand up to ' em for real ... , ... and then you 'll be the you she thinks you are . Fashion victim . Me ? ! Who does she think she is ? ! At least I do n't double as a floatation device ! Do n't sell yourself short , my little leather-clad licorice stick ! I ca n't take any chances with her around . Get a grip , Brutus . I thought you 'd never ask . No , you idiot ! I want you to catch that fish ! - You all right ? - I 'm better than all right . Iolaus , I want to stay with you forever . - Let 's get married . - Nautica ... We have to slow down . I mean , we hardly know each other . I have n't had time to ask you what your favorite color is ... , - ... your favorite hobby ... - Blue ! Swimming ! You know what I mean . Iolaus , do n't you believe in love at first sight ? When I saw you standing up for those poor people ... , ... I knew you were the one . - So do I . - I 'm not the person you think I am . - I 'm not who you think I am . Time to sort out all this confusion . Now , which one of you 's Nautica ? So which one of you 's the creep ... who beat up my men ? ! Ok . You ... are dead . And you ... are mine . Well , you 're really asking for it this time ... , ... because Iolaus went easy on you before . Nautica , let 's not try and upset the ... rather large gentleman who obviously has his own zip code . - Is that right , Mr . Tough Guy ? - Wha ... Time to teach you a lesson . Wait , that 's it . Lesson . The fight is often won before the first punch is thrown . Yeah ... You know what ? I would really hate to do this without telling you that your shoes are untied . - Well , it ai n't gon na happen . - Okay , okay , okay ! I tried ! Run ! Let 's go ! All right , all ready ! Those sirens are like the dog whistles of the gods ! Call ' em off ! Thank you for answering my call , Aphrodite . Any friend of Poseidon is a friend of mine . What 's up ? It 's my daughter . She swam away from home . You blew my eardrums out for that ? Listen , my main merman , do n't sweat it . She 's a kid . She 'll come back . And could we , like , turn up the heat in here ? It 's freezing . That 's just it . I ca n't . When Nautica was born ... , ... my brother Poseidon gifted her with a heart so pure it warms the seas . If she does n't return by sunset , the waters of Greece will turn to ice . Bummer . Instead , I tried to arrange a marriage to make her stay . Did you say " Nautica " ? That 's great . I just saw her in the village . She 's on the land ? How 's that possible ? Discord . I knew that scheming little skeezer was up to something . Do n't worry , Triton . I know exactly where to find her . She 's with ... Curly . Oh , no . It looks like we left ' em behind . - You 're amazing ! - Only when ... I 'm with you . I wonder what they wanted with you . - Beats me . - Nautica , I ... Well , I 've been thinking about what you said before ... , ... about ... love at first sight . And I do n't know . When I 'm with you , I I am the person I always wanted to be . Nothing will ever change the way I feel about you . Well , I would n't be too sure about that . I 've been looking all over for you ! Now is not a good time . Can we talk later ? - Was it something I said ? - No , no , no . Not you . You ! - You who ? - Me me ! She ca n't see me , Curly , and we have to talk , like , pronto ! Okay . Could you just wait for one moment ? You lost them . They were running really ... fast . How fast could she have been running ? She 's only had legs for one day ! Well , we 're trying our best ! And now , you 're hurting my feelings ! Yeah ! You 're hurtin ' his feelings ! Anyone else have something to say ? - Brutus ... - N ... o ! Darling ... , I know it 's not your fault ... , ... I would 've killed you long ago . Gee , thanks . Shut up ! Listen carefully . I 'm gon na make it easy for you . Step one : approach the girl . Step two : grab the girl . Step three : bring the girl here . Got it ? What girl ? Oh , yeah , right ! And I 'm a centaur ! I 'm sorry , Iolaus , but it 's true . She 's got ta go back . Have you taken a look at her recently ? She is not a mermaid . She has legs . Yeah , which Discord gave to her , to freeze the oceans . Oh , why would she wan na do that ? Hello ? ! Her name is Discord ! I know what this is about . This is about you ! Me ? ! Yeah . I found love without your help ... , ... and you ca n't stand it . So not , even in the hard-corest of ways !.. out of the goodness of my huge heart . Yeah ! Which we could all see beating if it were n't for your skin ! Put some clothes on , for the gods ' sakes ! That is it ! You 're on your own ! Let the seas freeze for all I care ! I hope you two are very happy ! How ? He loves me . He loves me not . He loves me . He loves me not . He loves me . He loves me not . He loves me . What are you doing ? ! Iolaus ! My , my ! Discord will be pleased ! Nautica ! Nautica ! Oh , no ! - Here . - Why are you doing this ? ! Tie her down ! Discord ? ! I thought you were my friend ! What makes you think I care about your happiness in the slightest ? - Why did you help me then ? - Help you ? There 's no greater handicap than innocence , my dear . Yeah ! Must be ... nice . Time to pop the balloon . Your father never told you the real reason he wanted you to stay . If you 're not home in time for supper ... , ... the seas will freeze ... , ... along with everyone you left behind . No ! Look on the bright side . We can all learn to ice skate . Okay , I can do this . Flowers work every time . Here . Aphrodite , I know I 'm the last person you want to see right now ... , ... but , well , Nautica 's been kidnapped and I need your help . Please do n't punish her for what I said . I know I did n't believe you , but , well , that 's ' cause ' cause I love her , and I do n't wan na let her go . Did I mention you 're my favorite god ? Go on . You 're funny , and you 're ... Come on , Curly . Let 's go save your girlfriend . She do n't look like no mermaid . Think of her as powdered milk . You just add water . Then what are we waiting for ? Iolaus will find me , and he 'll stop you . Iolaus would run from his own shadow without Aphrodite 's help . He 's not the hero you think he is . But I 'm about to be . What you 're about to do , my pesky little friend ... , ... is find out how much love can truly hurt . Get him ! Now , now . Let 's keep this fight fair . You want a piece of me , Elvira ? What are you gon na do , love girl ? Shower me with hearts ? - Hi . - Iolaus ! I knew you 'd come . Look out ! - Tramp ! - Tootsie ! Trollop ! You ... ! Time ... to meet your maker . I 'm sorry , Iolaus . She really is a fish ! Hey ! That 's my girlfriend you 're laughing at ! Looks like you got a nasty case of crabs . Get these things off of me ! You better hightail it out of here , Discord . I do n't think you wan na be too close to the coast when I tell Poseidon what you 've been up to . The good thing about being immortal ? You always have time to try again . - Nautica ... - Iolaus ! It 's all right . You do n't have to say anything . We should 've been honest with each other from the beginning . We were . I meant it when I told you " I love you . " . So did I . That 's why I 'm gon na get you home . Nautica ! Tell Triton he owes me one . And do n't be too hard on him . He loves you , you know . Thank you , Aphrodite . This is where we first met ... , ... I still would 've kissed you . How about one for the road ? I 'm never gon na be able to thank you enough . For what ? For giving me something to fight for . Are you ready ? I 'll never forget you . Iolaus ? Hey . - Hi . - So , how was your day ? Oh , well , you know how it is . I did a little of this ... and a little of that . Well , I ran into Aphrodite down the road . Looked like she 'd been crying . - You guys have any trouble ? - No , no . Nothing I could n't handle . So , how about you ? You 've been saving innocent people ... , ... helping them rebuild their lives in the face of senseless tragedy . Actually , the mud slide missed the village entirely . I spent the whole day signing autographs . - Really ? - Yeah . Go figure . You know , roust a few bullies , kick a little butt ! Iolaus ... Are you sure you 're all right ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm gon na be fine . Yeah . Hey , Iolaus ? Why do you smell like fish ? Subtitles : @marlonrock1986

Hey , I 'm done with Catholic school . And my dad fixed it so I can graduate at Point Place with you guys . My best memories are under that skirt . Hey , Mom ? Where 's Daddy ? I need $20 . - For what ? - In an effort to clean up my act ... I 'm buying my own drinks now . Well , he 's not home . When Eric told him about his little plan to move away with Donna after graduation ... your father went fishing . - What ? - No ! What the big deal ? You guys are really freakin ' me out . My dad only goes fishing when he 's , like , super-pissed . I think something about stabbing a worm over and over again with a hook is , like ... um , therapeutic for him . Yeah . - What ? - Eric 's moving away ! That 's right . And that 's why your father 's angry . This is your way of acting grown up ? Grown-ups do n't just leave the comfort of their parents ' home to- to move to a new city and start a life ? Well , maybe not in the 1930s- ' 40s-God , you 're so young .

And I 'm pretty sure the answer is pink jelly beans . Now , they used to be pink and white jelly beans , but I ate all the white ones ... ' cause I know you do n't like things that taste white . Okay . Look . Michael , just because Steven and I broke up ... does not mean I want you throwing yourself at me . Whoa . Jackie , this is the new and improved Michael . Okay ? I 'm not throwing anything at you except for happy thoughts and jelly beans . Yeah , I think it is . - So why do we still have clothes on ? - Oh , God . Michael , get out ! Oh , Jackie , I 'm talking about our emotional clothes . Okay , look , I know I 've made mistakes in the past , okay ? But I 've changed , and I just want you to get to know the new me . Yeah , the new you , huh ? What does the new you cheat with- every skank who throws her fat , furry butt at you ? Jackie , no one I ever cheated with had a fat , furry butt !

But then the third time- the third time is when I get funky . - Jackie-- No , no . Steven , I 'm not here to see you . Okay ? I 'm just here to see Donna . Look , I told you I 'm sorry , and I made a mistake . Can we just talk , please ? Talk about what ? You cheated on me . Okay ? It 's over . I feel nothing . Ooh , bitchy . You know what ?

I 've been waiting for this moment since ... well , the last time we vandalized the water tower . So , Hyde ... gaveJackie some jelly beans today ... and that is the bean of love . And I got her that particular bean because I never stopped loving her . Yeah , well , you stopped long enough to cheat on her with Pam Macy , Laurie and Annette . - Who else am I forgetting ? -  There were many others . But you cheated on her with a nurse . It was a misunderstanding that you caused . - That 's it . Let 's go . - Oh , yeah ? I 'm ready . I hope you got that nurse 's number . You 're gon na need it when I 'm done . Hey , stop it .

All you can do is punch my ass . - Hey , get down ! - Just face the fact , Hyde . You 're down there and I 'm up here , and I am invincible .  -  - Kelso , are you okay ? I think I fell ! - I 'm gon na go check on him . - Okay . Okay , I think he 'll be fine . Now , let 's see . Where do I begin ? I want it to look like it 's coming right at me .  ManOnP.A . This is the Point Place Police Department . You 're under arrest ! Um , I am a painter from a foreign country ... and this is my gift to America . Get off the water tower ! People of America ... I give you Genitals in the Sky . -  - Run for it . No , you do n't . You made your bed . Now you have to lie in it . Oh , who am I kidding ? You never make your bed . Eric , wait . Listen .

Inhales , Singsongy You 're gon na get it . You 're gon na get it . Lay it on him , Red .  While I was fishing , I had a lotta time to think . - That 's right . - And all that thinking made me very angry . Very angry . And the fish that were unlucky enough to cross my path-Well , you know how they say that fish ca n't feel pain ? That 's a load of crap . A big load . And I finally came to a conclusion ... Eric ... - I 'm proud of you . - And that goes double for- What the hell did you say ? I did everything I could to stop you from getting married ... but you stuck to your guns . And I admire that you 're willing to go out on your own . You 're a man now , and you have my blessing . This is like The Godfather . I think you have to kiss his ring . How can you just give in and let Eric leave home ? He has defied you over and over . He 's a- a lying , cheating , conniving liar ... and I wo n't let you send my precious baby boy away . Kitty , my mind is made up . And , Eric , we 're gon na pay for your college too . Really ? Dad , I-I do n't know what to say to you , except ... you 're great ! That 's all right , Son . We do n't do that here . Okay . Well . He can go to school in the fall like everyone else . We can take a pottery class ! No , Kitty , he 's leaving : No pottery class , no mother-son dancing lessons ... no trying out for Family Feud . But this deal is only good if you stay focused . If you do something stupid- like get Donna pregnant- you 're on your own . Then I guess this is a bad time to give you the news . I 'm kidding ! I 'm just so giddy ! - So it 's just a sprain , huh ? - Yeah , it does n't hurt too bad .  I guess the best part is I 've now fallen off the water tower in every grade . That record will stand until your son goes to school . - Thanks for drivin ' me to the hospital , man . - Oh , whatever . No . Not " whatever . " I mean , look ... and we fought over her ? And then after you pulled my head out of the toilet , and I let go of your bean bags ... we made a pact to never fight over a girl again . You know , you 're right , man . I mean , neither of us has a shot with Jackie anyway . - So I 'm steppin ' back . - No . No , no . You go for it . I 'll step back . No , I 'm serious . Door 's open for you . No , I 'm serious . The door is open for you . - I just closed the door for me ! - Well , I 'm closin ' the door for me ... and I 'm lockin ' myself inside , and I 'm swallowing ' the key ! Fine . We 're both done with her . You 're my bud . -  Steven ! Are you okay ? - Why ? Well , I heard someone fell off the water tower , and I thought it could be you . L-- No , it was Kelso . -  Wait . You came down here , ' cause you were worried about me . No , I did n't . ' Cause you still care about me . Uh-uh . - So I still have a shot with you . - No . No , you do n't . I mean , okay . I do n't know . Steven , stop staring at me , or I 'll kick you . Ah ! Jackie , hope you did n't come here to make love to me . - No , Michael . L- - ' Cause I 'm fine . All I need is my buddy Hyde . And no chick is gon na come between us anymore . - Right , Hyde ? - Uh-h-h , yeah . Yeah . Let 's go , buddy Hyde . Aah ! - Oh , cool .

Just Kelso and Hyde . No chick can come between us . All right . So what do ya wan na do ? We can play air hockey , give Fez a wedgie , uh-Oh , my brother just got a new stereo . We can throw it off an overpass . Actually , I changed my mind . I 'm gon na getJackie back . What ? No way . What about our third-grade pact ? We also made a pact to invent a formula for invisibility . Look , Kelso . I never felt this way about a girl before , okay ? And that pretty much beats our third-grade pact . I 'm sorry , but I wan na be with her . Well , at the hospital , you said that I could have her . That was when I did n't think I still had a shot with her . Your - For your information , I still have a shot with her . She accepted my jelly beans . I do n't know what that means , but you ca n't have her . You closed the door . Yeah ? Well , now I 'm closin ' the door on you , and once again , I 'm swallowing ' the key . And you 're locked inside , and I 'm gettin'Jackie back . Well , you 're gon na lose . Heh-heh . Yeah ? Well , if by " lose " you mean " win , " then you 're right . I am gon na lose . Fez , what happened ? Well , I got arrested . And they did a background check ... and found out that my student visa expires when I graduate from high school . - What ? - Yeah , and now I have to leave the country after graduation . That 's in a week . And I have to relearn my native language . - Good day . - No , but Fez-  Way to go . If you had n't fallen off the water tower , we could 've helped him out . Aah ! Aa-aa-aah ! They should 've x-rayed your head at the hospital . They did . And for your information , they found nothing . Hmm . I ca n't believe our little Fez is gon na be deported . God , I wish there was something we could do . Maybe I could talk to the mayor . He owes me one . Eric , we ca n't let this happen . If Fez goes back to his country with those pictures he took ... Shut up and eat . Dear PresidentJimmy Carter . The following is a list of reasons ... why I , Fez , should be allowed to stay in your great country . Number one : I have never gone number one on your beautiful soil . Number two : I have never gone number two on your-Wait . Scratch that . Number two : " Fez " is also a word for a hat . Uncle Sam wears a hat . Coincidence ?  Yes . Three , where else am I going to live ? France ?   France . 
@@5241341 MAN AS JACKIE ROBINSON : I AM PROUD OF MY BLACKNESS , PROUD OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF BLACK PEOPLE . THINK OF ME AS THE KIND OF NEGRO WHO COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE IS N'T GOING TO BEG FOR ANYTHING , THAT HE WILL BE REASONABLE BUT HE DAMNED WELL IS TIRED OF BEING PATIENT . JACKIE ROBINSON . HOWARD BRYANT : MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE , WHAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE WANTED FROM AMERICA IS A SEAT AT THE TABLE . JACKIE ROBINSON KNEW ONCE HE GOT IN THE DOOR , HE COULD KNOCK DOWN ALL OF THESE CONVENTIONS . FIRST , YOU GET OUT THERE AND YOU PROVE YOU CAN PLAY . THEN YOU CAN START TALKING BACK TO UMPS . THEN YOU START DEALING WITH WRITERS ON YOUR TERMS INSTEAD OF THEIR TERMS . THEN YOU START FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THE HOTELS ARE INTEGRATED . AND OVER TIME , JACKIE ROBINSON HAS PUSHED US FORWARD . FOR HIM , THERE WAS NO SATISFACTION WITH SIMPLY BEING ALLOWED TO ENTER THE ROOM . BUT THAT 'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE FOR HIM TO SUSTAIN . HE HAD PURCHASED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK HIS MIND MANY TIMES OVER . NARRATOR : ON APRIL 15 , 1947 , JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE MODERN AGE TO PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL .  IN HIS FIRST SEASON WITH THE BROOKLYN DODGERS , HE HAD SILENTLY ENDURED RACIST TAUNTS , THREATS , AND ABUSE , PERFORMING SPECTACULARLY ON THE FIELD AND BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEN IN THE COUNTRY . LATER , UNBURDENED OF HIS PROMISE TO BRANCH RICKEY TO KEEP QUIET , TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK , AMERICANS WOULD BEGIN TO SEE THE REAL JACKIE ROBINSON , AND THEY WOULD NOT ALWAYS LIKE HIM . RACHEL ROBINSON : EARLY ON , THEY LIKED JACK , BECAUSE HE WAS BEING A GOOD BOY AND HE WAS DOING WHAT THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD DO AND HE WAS KEEPING HIS MOUTH SHUT . NARRATOR : AFTER BASEBALL , HE WOULD SPEAK OUT TIRELESSLY , USING HIS IMMENSE FAME TO PROMOTE EQUALITY AND CREATE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS EVERYWHERE . BUT IN AN AGE OF PROFOUND SOCIAL UPHEAVAL AS HIS INFLUENCE DIMINISHED AND HIS HEALTH DECLINED , HE WOULD SOMETIMES STRUGGLE TO FIND HIS PLACE IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HE HAD ONCE SYMBOLIZED . AND HIS HOME , ONCE A HAVEN FROM THE FIGHT OUTSIDE , WOULD SEE UNIMAGINABLE SORROW . RACHEL ROBINSON : JACK NEVER TALKED ABOUT CARRYING THE ASPIRATIONS OF OUR RACE AS A BURDEN . HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IT AS ... AS KIND OF OPPORTUNITY . AND HE WAS PROUD , VERY PROUD , WHEN HE SUCCEEDED IN SOME WAY AND DEVASTATED WHEN HE DID N'T . BUT HE KNEW THAT WE HAD TO HAVE RACIAL EQUALITY IN AMERICA . AND IF WE DID N'T , IF HE DID N'T DO HIS PART AND DID N'T ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THEIR PART , NO CHANGE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE . AND IN WALKED OUR HERO , JACKIE ROBINSON . WE WERE STARTLED . AND HE PAID FOR HIS NEWSPAPERS , AND HE TURNED TO WALK OUT , AND HE TURNED BACK AND SAID , " WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE SOME ICE CREAM ? " EVERYBODY SAID , " YES , MR . ROBINSON . " HE SAID , " NO , NO , NO . CALL ME JACKIE . CALL ME JACKIE . " I WAS SO EXCITED ... MY KNEES WERE KNOCKING ... TO SEE A REAL HERO WHO LOOKED LIKE US . WE SHUFFLED OUR FEET . WE DID N'T SAY ANYTHING . WE DID N'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY ANYTHING . BUT HE SPOKE , YOU KNOW , GAVE US KIND OF A PEP TALK . NOW WE SAW HIM AS SOMEONE WE COULD ALMOST TOUCH . AND HE BECAME EVEN MORE INTENSELY OUR HERO .   NARRATOR : IN MARCH OF 1948 , JACKIE ROBINSON REPORTED TO SPRING TRAINING 25 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT . " WAIT UNTIL OPENING DAY , " HE PROMISED .  BUT WHEN THE SEASON BEGAN , ROBINSON WAS SLUGGISH ON THE BASE PATHS AND BY MID-JUNE STILL HAD N'T STOLEN A BASE . ALTHOUGH HE KEPT HIS BATTING AVERAGE NEAR .300 ALL SUMMER , THE DODGERS FINISHED 1948 7 12 GAMES OUT . ROBINSON 'S NUMBERS WERE NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE YEAR BEFORE , BUT HE KNEW HE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER . THAT SEASON , JACKIE ROBINSON WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR " EBONY " MAGAZINE CONDEMNING NEGRO LEAGUE BASEBALL . THE CLUBS , HE CLAIMED , WERE UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISORGANIZED , AND SOME OF THE PLAYERS LACKED " CHARACTER AND MORALS . " EFFA MANLEY , THE OWNER OF THE NEGRO LEAGUES NEWARK EAGLES , BLASTED ROBINSON FOR TURNING ON THE LEAGUE THAT HELPED GET HIM TO THE MAJORS . " I CHARGE JACKIE ROBINSON WITH BEING UNGRATEFUL , " SHE SAID , " AND MORE LIKELY STUPID . " GERALD EARLY : JACKIE ROBINSON WAS AN INTEGRATIONIST . ONCE INTEGRATION HAPPENED , THE NEGRO LEAGUES WERE NO LONGER VIABLE . AND THEY CRUMBLED .  @band_playing " THESTAR-SPANGLEDBANNER " NARRATOR : AS THE 1949 SEASON BEGAN , BRANCH RICKEY TOLD ROBINSON HE COULD NOW PLAY WITHOUT RESTRAINT . ROBINSON DID N'T NEED ANY ENCOURAGEMENT . WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM WHAT OPPONENTS COULD EXPECT FROM HIM , ROBINSON REPLIED , " THEY BETTER BE ROUGH ON ME , BECAUSE I 'M GOING TO BE ROUGH ON THEM . " RACHEL ROBINSON : JACK SAID , " WE 'VE GOT THIS THING GOING . " THE TEAM IS WINNING . I 'M DOING WELL . I 'M GON NA SPEAK OUT . " AND SO HE BEGAN TO CHALLENGE OTHER BALLPLAYERS AND CHALLENGE UMPIRES WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE . MAN AS JACKIE : SPORTSWRITERS SEEMED TO COME DIRECTLY TO ME WHENEVER THERE WAS A HINT OF A STORY ... THAT I WOULD N'T WHINE THAT I WAS MISQUOTED . IT FELT GOOD TO BREATHE FREELY , TO SPEAK OUT WHEN I WANTED TO . NARRATOR : THAT SEASON , ROBINSON PLAYED BETTER THAN HE EVER HAD . BY MID-JULY , HE WAS LEADING THE LEAGUE IN HITS , BATTING AVERAGE , STOLEN BASES , AND RUNS BATTED IN . WHEN ALL THE VOTES WERE TALLIED FOR THE 1949 ALL-STAR GAME , ONLY RED SOX OUTFIELDER TED WILLIAMS HAD RECEIVED MORE . CARL ERSKINE : YOU KNOW , KIDS , THEY 'RE HONEST . AND WHEN A KID CAME BACK 3 TIMES FOR MY AUTOGRAPH , I SAID , " WHY WOULD YOU WANT THREE OF MINE ? " WELL , HE WAS HONEST . HE SAID , " ACTUALLY I WANT SIX . " " IF I CAN GET SIX OF YOURS , " " I COULD TRADE IT FOR ONE OF JACKIE ROBINSON 'S . " NARRATOR : OTHER TEAMS WERE BEGINNING TO INTEGRATE , BUT NO CLUB MOVED AS QUICKLY AS THE DODGERS . BUT THE THREE MEN WERE ASSIGNED LOCKERS IN A CORNER OF THE CLUBHOUSE , AND THEY SHOWERED SEPARATELY FROM THEIR WHITE TEAMMATES , MANY OF WHOM WERE STILL UNCOMFORTABLE PLAYING WITH BLACKS .  ANNOUNCER : EBBETS FIELD , BROOKLYN , SCENE OF THE 16th ANNUAL ALL-STAR GAME . JACKIE ROBINSON UP . JACKIE RIFLES A SHOT INTO LEFT FIELD . THE FIRST NEGRO PLAYER TO APPEAR ON AN ALL-STAR GAME , THE BROOKLYN DODGERS SPEED MERCHANT DOES N'T STOP RUNNING TILL HE FLIES INTO SECOND WITH A DOUBLE . NARRATOR : IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPECTACULAR 1949 SEASON , ROBINSON WAS ASKED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE , WHICH WAS INVESTIGATING INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS SUSPECTED OF HAVING COMMUNIST SYMPATHIES . PAUL ROBESON :  HE DO N'T PLANT TATERS   HE DO N'T PLANT COTTON   AND THEM THAT PLANTS ' EM   IS SOON FORGOTTEN ...  ROGER KAHN : YOU HAVE NOT HEARD A BASS BARITONE SING UNTIL YOU HEAR A RECORDING OF ROBESON . ROBESON :  ... JUST KEEPS ROLLING ALONG  HE WAS ALSO A SERIOUS RADICAL . HE WAS A GREAT FAN OF THE SOVIET UNION . AND HE SPOKE HIS MIND . ROBESON : I ' AND YOU LAND IN THE JAIL ... I ' HARRY BELAFONTE : FOR ME , PAUL ROBESON WAS THE TALLEST TREE IN OUR FOREST . ROBESON STOOD THAT STRONG IN OUR MIDST AS THE KIND OF VOICE , NOT ONLY FOR THE ISSUES AFFECTING BLACK PEOPLE , BUT FOR ISSUES AFFECTING POOR PEOPLE , SAYING , " THIS IS ALSO OUR SPACE , THIS IS ALSO OUR TURF , THIS IS ALSO OUR COUNTRY . I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS ON PAUL ROBESON 'S STATEMENTS IN PARIS TO THE EFFECT THAT AMERICAN NEGROES WOULD REFUSE TO FIGHT IN ANY WAR AGAINST RUSSIA BECAUSE WE LOVE RUSSIA SO MUCH . I HAVE N'T ANY COMMENT TO MAKE EXCEPT THAT ON THAT STATEMENT , EXCEPT THAT IF MR . ROBESON ACTUALLY MADE IT , IT SOUNDS VERY SILLY TO ME . IT IS N'T VERY PLEASANT FOR ME TO FIND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC ARGUMENT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STANDING OF THE BROOKLYN DODGERS IN THE PENNANT RACE OR EVEN TO THE PAY RAISE I 'M GOING TO ASK MR . BRANCH RICKEY FOR NEXT YEAR .  NARRATOR : THE " DAILY NEWS " CALLED ROBINSON " A CREDIT NOT ONLY TO HIS OWN RACE , BUT TO ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE , " WHILE THE " NEW YORK POST " RAN AN EXCERPT FROM THE STATEMENT AS AN EDITORIAL TITLED " CREDO OF AN AMERICAN . THE BLACK PRESS , IT WAS MIXED BECAUSE ROBESON WAS SEEN AS A HERO AMONG BLACK PEOPLE . NARRATOR : THE POET LANGSTON HUGHES WRITING IN THE " CHICAGO DEFENDER , " WONDERED HOW THE HOUSE COMMITTEE COULD INVESTIGATE " REDS AND SECOND BASEMEN BUT NOT THE KU KLUX KLAN . " THE HABIT OF BAD-MOUTHING , ONE WOMAN WROTE OF ROBINSON TO THE " PITTSBURGH COURIER , " " IS A SLAVERY TRAIT AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUTGROWN . " BRYANT : IT 'S AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF ROBINSON 'S GREAT MISSTEPS . THE GOVERNMENT WAS USING HIM TO DESTROY ANOTHER AFRICAN AMERICAN . IT 'S ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT STRATEGY TO HAVE ONE BLACK PERSON CRITICIZE ANOTHER TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE BLACK COMMUNITY . AND IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE . NARRATOR : THE INVESTIGATION RUINED ROBESON 'S CAREER . THE SINGER HIMSELF DECLINED TO CRITICIZE ROBINSON AND INSTEAD DENOUNCED THE HEARING AS AN INSULT TO ALL NEGRO PEOPLE . BUT IN THE WORLD SERIES , JACKIE STRUGGLED AT THE PLATE . THE DODGERS AGAIN LOST TO THE NEW YORK YANKEES . STILL , 1949 WAS ROBINSON 'S FINEST YEAR .  ANNOUNCER : AT HIS ST . ALBANS , NEW YORK , HOME , BROOKLYN DODGER JACKIE ROBINSON LEARNS THAT THE SPORTSWRITERS HAVE VOTED HIM THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE . THERE 'S A WIFELY KISS FOR JACKIE , WHO LED THE LEAGUE IN BATTING AND STOLEN BASES . SON JACKIE JR . HEARS THE NEWS ON HIS THIRD BIRTHDAY . THE FIRST MEMBER OF HIS RACE TO PLAY IN THE MAJORS MAKES GOOD IN A BIG WAY . NARRATOR : THAT FALL , JACKIE AND RACHEL HAD BOUGHT A HOUSE IN THE MIXED-RACE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ST . ALBANS , QUEENS . THE BANDLEADER COUNT BASIE , SINGER LENA HORNE , AND ROY AND RUTHE CAMPANELLA ALL LIVED NEARBY . THREE-YEAR-OLD JACKIE JR . QUICKLY MADE FRIENDS WITH KIDS ON THE BLOCK . JACKIE STOOD OUTSIDE THE YMCA IN HARLEM ANNOUNCING THE GOOD NEWS AND PASSING OUT CIGARS . ARE YOU NERVOUS ? A LITTLE , MAYBE . BUT I WO N'T BE WHEN WE GET OUT ON THE FIELD . ANOTHER HOUR AND WE 'LL BEGIN . WOULD YOU RATHER I DID N'T GO ? NO . YOU MIGHT AS WELL COME TO THE GAME . IF I 'M GON NA FALL ON MY FACE , IT MIGHT AS WELL BE IN FRONT OF YOU , TOO . YOU WO N'T FALL DOWN , DARLING . NARRATOR : " THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORY , " FILMED THAT WINTER , STARRED JACKIE ROBINSON AS HIMSELF , WITH A YOUNG ACTRESS NAMED RUBY DEE PLAYING RACHEL . THE FILM GOT MIXED REVIEWS , THOUGH CRITICS DID PRAISE ROBINSON 'S UNDERSTATED PERFORMANCE . MR . RICKEY , DO YOU WANT A BALLPLAYER WHO 'S AFRAID TO FIGHT BACK ? I WANT A BALLPLAYER WITH GUTS ENOUGH NOT TO FIGHT BACK . SO I HAUL OFF AND PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE CHEEK . WHAT DO YOU DO ? MR . RICKEY , I 'VE GOT TWO CHEEKS . GOOD .  NARRATOR : THAT SEASON , JACKIE 'S ASSERTIVENESS BEGAN TO RANKLE MANY IN THE BASEBALL WORLD . ROBINSON WAS CERTAIN THAT UMPIRES WERE TREATING HIM DIFFERENTLY ... MAKING BAD CALLS , TAUNTING HIM , THROWING HIM OUT OF GAMES WITH LITTLE PROVOCATION BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK . LATER , THE " SPORTING NEWS " WOULD CALL HIM A " CHRONIC GRIPER , " AND HE WOULD BE FALSELY ACCUSED OF KICKING IN THE DOOR OF THE UMPIRES ' DRESSING ROOM . EARLY : HE HAD A KIND OF FURY IN HIM . I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC , IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO SEE A BLACK MAN ARGUING AND BEING FEISTY . IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT THAN TO SEE THE ROBINSON THEY SAW AT FIRST . THE 1951 BROOKLYN DODGERS WERE LOADED WITH ALL-STARS . AND AS SPRING TRAINING BEGAN , THEY WERE CONFIDENT THAT THEY HAD THE BEST LINEUP IN BASEBALL . BY MID-MAY , ROBINSON WAS BATTING OVER .400 AND THE DODGERS WERE IN FIRST PLACE . BUT HE WAS STILL A TARGET . BEFORE A GAME IN CINCINNATI , LETTERS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE REDS AND THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER CLAIMING THAT JACKIE ROBINSON WOULD BE SHOT IF HE TOOK THE FIELD . NEWCOMBE : I WO N'T USE THE WORDS THAT THEY USED , BUT THEY SAID , " IF YOU SHOW UP TODAY AT CROSLEY FIELD , YOU ARE GOING TO DIE . " JACKIE SAID , " WELL , WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ? " I SAID , " WELL , WHAT DO YOU THINK ? " HE SAID , " ARE YOU GOING TO THE BALLPARK TODAY ? " I SAID , " ARE YOU GOING ? " HE SAID , " YES , I 'M GOING .B.I . MEN THROUGHOUT THE BALLPARK , ON THE ROOFTOPS . AND THEY HAD A MEETING BEFORE THE GAME . IT WAS PRETTY TENSE . AND IT GOT PRETTY QUIET . AND WHAT ... WHAT DO WE SAY ? GENE HERMANSKI , KIND OF A KIDDER , SAID , " HEY , SKIPPER , I GOT AN IDEA . " IF WE ALL WORE NUMBER 42 , THEY WOULD N'T KNOW WHO TO SHOOT AT . " AND JACKIE HAD A GOOD LAUGH . AND HE SAID , " LET 'S PLAY BASEBALL . "  NARRATOR : ROBINSON HIT A 3-RUN HOME RUN IN THE FIRST GAME , AND BROOKLYN SWEPT THE DOUBLEHEADER . NO SHOTS WERE FIRED .  ANNOUNCER : WHO NEEDS FIREWORKS ON JULY 4th ? ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SECOND PLACE NEW YORK GIANTS INVADE EBBETS FIELD FORA DOUBLEHEADER AGAINST THE LEAGUE-LEADING BROOKLYN DODGERS . GIANT MANAGER DUROCHER IS ... NARRATOR : BY MID-AUGUST , THE DODGERS LED THE NATIONAL LEAGUE BY 13 GAMES AND HAD BEATEN THEIR ARCHRIVALS , THE SECOND PLACE NEW YORK GIANTS , 12 OUT OF 15 TIMES .

NARRATOR : WITH THE DODGERS LEADING 4-2 IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH , RALPH BRANCA CAME IN TO FACE THIRD BASEMAN BOBBY THOMSON . THERE WERE TWO MEN ON BASE . RUSS HODGES : AND WE 'LL SEE HOW RALPH BRANCA WILL FARE AGAINST BOBBY THOMSON AND THEN WILLIE MAYS TO FOLLOW . BRANCA : THEY BROUGHT ME IN . AND THE FIRST PITCH TO THOMSON ... AND HE TOOK IT . YOU COULD N'T PUT IT ANY MORE IN THE CENTER OF THE PLATE THAN THAT . I MEAN IT WAS CROTCH-HIGH , RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLATE . HODGES : ...

THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT ! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT ! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT ! BOBBY THOMSON HITS INTO THE LOWER DECK OF THE LEFT-FIELD ... SCULLY : WHEN BOBBY HIT THE HOME RUN , EVERYBODY STARTED LEAVING THE FIELD . JACKIE STOOD AT SECOND BASE AND MADE SURE THAT BOBBY THOMSON STEPPED ON EACH BAG . TYPICAL . YOU KNOW , WITH EVERYTHING ELSE , UH , HE WAS STILL DOING HIS JOB . RACHEL ROBINSON : JACK SUDDENLY LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT . AND HE BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN HIS LEGS . NARRATOR : IN 1952 , AT AGE 33 , JACKIE ROBINSON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES . RACHEL ROBINSON : THE DOCTOR ALSO FOUND THAT HIS HEART WAS DETERIORATING . AND THEY DID . HE DID N'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE AND NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHAT CHANGES HE HAD TO MAKE IN ORDER TO KEEP PLAYING . NARRATOR : IN MAY , RACHEL GAVE BIRTH TO ANOTHER SON , DAVID . " I HAVE HAD TO REALIZE THAT BASEBALL , " ROBINSON SAID , " WILL ONE DAY BE OVER . " THAT SEASON , THE DODGERS WON 96 GAMES AND HELPED REDEEM THEIR HEARTBREAKING COLLAPSE OF THE PREVIOUS FALL . DESPITE HIS HEALTH ISSUES , ROBINSON AGAIN LED THE WAY , BATTING .308 AND HITTING A CAREER-BEST 19 HOME RUNS . BUT IN THE WORLD SERIES , HE HIT JUST .174 . ANNOUNCER : A 4-2 SEVENTH GAME VICTORY FOR THE YANKEES , THEIR FOURTH STRAIGHT WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP . RACHEL ROBINSON : IT WAS , YOU KNOW , " WE 'RE NOT GIVIN ' UP . " " WE 'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT . " " IT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN . " I MEAN , IT 'S LIKE , " IT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN ! AGAIN , IT 'S , WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR . IN THE YANKEE DRESSING ROOM , EXCITEMENT ... NARRATOR : DURING THE OFF-SEASON , ROBINSON WAS ASKED IF HE THOUGHT THE YANKEES WERE PREJUDICED . " YES , " HE RESPONDED . " THERE IS N'T A SINGLE NEGRO ON THE TEAM NOW AND VERY FEW IN THE ENTIRE FARM SYSTEM . " THE YANKEES WERE FURIOUS , INSISTING THAT THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO FIELD A BLACK PLAYER , IF ONLY ONE WERE GOOD ENOUGH . MANY WHITES GREW TO RESENT ROBINSON 'S INCREASING OUTSPOKENNESS , AND SOME BLACKS WORRIED THAT IT WOULD SET BACK THE PROGRESS HE 'D MADE FOR THEM . " JACKIE ROBINSON OUGHT TO BEHAVE HIMSELF , " ONE WOMAN WROTE THE " CHICAGO DEFENDER , " " BEFORE HE RUINS EVERYTHING FOR NEGROES IN BASEBALL . " REPORTERS WHO HAD ONCE SUNG HIS PRAISES NOW CALLED HIM A RABBLE-ROUSER , URGED HIM TO BE A PLAYER , NOT A CRUSADER . BRYANT : HE WAS BEING HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD . HERE 'S A PERSON WHO 'S IN FULL DIMENSION . THIS IS WHO HE WAS . WITHOUT THAT ANGER , YOU DO N'T GET JACKIE ROBINSON . DO YOU WANT TO KNOW JACKIE ROBINSON OR DO N'T YOU ? RACHEL ROBINSON : BECAUSE HE WAS A BLACK MAN WHEN HE WAS BEING ASSERTIVE , HE WAS BEING PUT IN A KIND OF STEREOTYPE OF BLACK MEN , LIKE ANGRY BLACK MAN . HE WAS NOT AN ANGRY BLACK MAN . HE WAS AN ATHLETE WHO WANTED TO WIN . BELAFONTE : IT 'S OK TO BE ANGRY . DR . KING SAID SO OFTEN , " ANGER IS A RIGHTEOUS EMOTION . " IT 'S ALMOST NECESSARY TO YOUR BEING . BRYANT : WHO WOULD N'T BE ANGRY ? AND WHAT WE WOULD PREFER TO DO IN AMERICA IS TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE PERSON WHO 'S ANGRY AND NOT FOCUS ON THE SITUATION THAT CREATED IT . IT WAS WRONG . THEY WANTED YOU TO BE LIKE THEY WANTED YOU TO BE . AND WE WERE NOT GON NA BE LIKE THEY WANTED YOU TO BE . WE WERE GON NA BE LIKE WE WANTED TO BE , BECAUSE SOMEBODY OWED US SOMETHING . SOMEBODY OWED US SOMETHING . AND THEY OWED IT ... THEY OWED IT MOSTLY TO JACKIE ROBINSON . NARRATOR : BUT ROBINSON 'S TEAMMATE ROY CAMPANELLA WAS WORRIED THAT JACKIE 'S ASSERTIVENESS WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD . EARLY : AS CAMPANELLA BEGINS TO RISE AS A STAR ON THE DODGERS , THERE BECOMES MORE OF THIS PITTING THE PERSONALITY OF CAMPANELLA AGAINST THE PERSONALITY OF ROBINSON AND THE SPORTSWRITERS LIKING CAMPANELLA MORE , UH , BECAUSE HE 'S , UM ... HE 'S MORE HOW THEY THINK A BLACK PLAYER SHOULD ACT . NARRATOR : " A FEW YEARS AGO , " " THERE WERE MANY MORE THINGS I COULD N'T DO , " HE SAID . " I 'M WILLING TO WAIT . HE CAME UP THE TOUGH WAY . WHEN HE MADE THE BIG LEAGUES , TO HIM , THIS WAS HEAVEN ON EARTH . AND SO HE WOULD TELL THE YOUNG PLAYERS WHO MIGHT WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR LOCKER OR SOMETHING , " HEY , COOL IT . COOL IT . WE 'RE IN THE BIG LEAGUES . DO N'T ROCK THE BOAT . WE 'RE HERE ! " RACHEL ROBINSON : HE AND JACK WERE VERY CLOSE . BUT CAMPY WAS NOT A PROTESTER . AND HE FELT THAT JACK PROTESTED TOO MUCH . SAID , " YOU 'RE LUCKY TO BE HERE . " AND JACK HATED THAT ATTITUDE . AND THEY BEGAN TO SPLIT . IT WAS VERY SAD FOR BOTH FAMILIES BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN VERY CLOSE . NARRATOR : WHATEVER THEIR DIFFERENCES OFF THE FIELD , THE TWO MEN CONTINUED TO BE THE HEART OF A DODGERS LINEUP THAT SEEMED TO FEATURE A NEW BLACK STAR EACH SEASON . AND THERE WAS SOME GRUMBLING AMONG VETERAN PLAYERS THAT " THE BLACKS ARE COMING IN AND AND TAKING OUR JOBS . " NARRATOR : " HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A NIGGER TO TAKE YOUR JOB ? " COX ASKED A REPORTER . LATER , AFTER THE DODGERS FIELDED A LINEUP THAT INCLUDED MORE BLACKS THAN WHITES , THE PRESS MADE AN ISSUE OF IT . " THE THOUGHT HAS BEEN ADVANCED , " WROTE THE " SPORTING NEWS , " THAT TOO MANY BLACKS ON ONE TEAM " WOULD NOT BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS . " ANNOUNCER : GOOD EVENING , EVERYBODY . TODAY 'S DECISION BY THE U.S . SUPREME COURT IS CALLED THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION OF ITS KIND SINCE THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION . OUR HIGH TRIBUNAL TODAY OUTLAWING RACIAL SEGREGATION IN SCHOOLS , BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL CHANGE AT ONCE . BUT OLD CUSTOMS REMAINED ENTRENCHED EVERYWHERE . RACHEL ROBINSON : I THINK THAT THE NORTHERN RACISM AS I EXPERIENCE IT TO THIS VERY DAY IS MORE DETRIMENTAL , MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SOUTH . THE ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES IN THE SOUTH WERE EASIER TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND OR TO FIGHT AGAINST THAN THE SUBTLE RACISM IN THE NORTH WHERE PEOPLE SAID , " OH , NO , WE 'RE NOT RACIST . IT JUST HAPPENS THAT ALL THE BUS DRIVERS ARE WHITE . " NARRATOR : SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR THIRD CHILD , RACHEL ROBINSON HAD BEEN SEARCHING FORA NEW , LARGER HOME . A HOUSE IN PURCHASE , NEW YORK , NORTH OF THE CITY , SEEMED JUST RIGHT , BUT WHEN THE ROBINSONS OFFERED THE ASKING PRICE , IT WAS QUICKLY TAKEN OFF THE MARKET . IN GREENWICH , CONNECTICUT , ONE COUPLE REFUSED EVEN TO SHOW HER THEIR HOUSE . RACHEL ROBINSON : WHEN WE WENT TO TRY TO BUY PROPERTY IN STAMFORD , CONNECTICUT , THE BROKER SAID THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE HAD . AND SHE ... OR SHE WOULD TAKE US TO UNSUITABLE TYPES OF PROPERTIES . BUT THEN WE LE ... LEARNED THAT SHE LIVED IN STAMFORD AND SHE DID N'T WANT US THERE . NARRATOR : WHEN A REPORTER FOR THE " BRIDGEPORT HERALD " HEARD ABOUT RACHEL 'S TROUBLES , HE MADE THE ROBINSONS THE FOCUS OF A PIECE ON HOUSING BIAS IN THE AREA . CARLY SIMON : MY MOTHER FOUND OUT FROM THE PAPERS THAT THE ROBINSONS HAD BEEN DENIED THE ABILITY TO BUY PROPERTY IN STAMFORD , CONNECTICUT . AND SO MY MOTHER WENT AROUND TO TEMPLES AND CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS AND STARTED SPEAKING UP A STORM . NARRATOR : ANDREA SIMON , THE WIFE OF THE CO-FOUNDER OF THE PUBLISHING HOUSE SIMON SCHUSTER , INVITED RACHEL TO STAMFORD AND ARRANGED FOR A BROKER TO TAKE THEM ON A TOUR OF AVAILABLE PROPERTIES . IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT RACHEL HAD BEEN DREAMING OF . DURING THE SUMMER OF 1954 WITH THEIR HOUSE UNDER CONSTRUCTION , THE ROBINSONS MOVED IN WITH CARLY SIMON AND HER FAMILY . SIMON : I CAME OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE WHERE MY MOTHER HAD BEEN ALL DAY . AND SHE SAID , " THESE ARE THE ROBINSONS , CARLY . I WANT YOU TO MEET JACKIE AND RACHEL ROBINSON . " OF COURSE I KNEW WHO JACKIE ROBINSON WAS . I WAS GOING TO BE THE FIRST GIRL CENTER FIELDER THAT THERE EVER WAS . SO JACKIE TOOK A LITTLE BAT , A CHILD SIZE BAT , AND HE TAUGHT ME TO SWING A BAT . HE WAS ... HE WAS , YOU KNOW , HE WAS A KING . RACHEL ROBINSON : WHEN WE BUILT OUR HOUSE , WE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO DID N'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE THERE . BUT WE WANTED A NATURAL SETTING FOR OUR FAMILY ... JACKIE : " GOVERNOR BRADFORD HAD INVITED THEM " " TO A FEAST THIS THANKSGIVING ... " RACHEL ROBINSON : AND WE CREATED IT . I THINK WE FEEL PROUD OF THAT , HAVING PRODUCED THIS FOR OURSELVES . JACKIE : " THE INDIANS WORE LEGGINGS " " AND A KIND OF SHIRT MADE OF DEERSKIN ... "  ERSKINE : ONE DAY , WE HAD A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR PEE WEE AT EBBETS FIELD . IN THE FIFTH INNING , THE GAME WAS HALTED AND HE 'S GON NA GET A CAR , AND WE GAVE HIM AWARDS . AND WE SANG " HAPPY BIRTHDAY . " AND WHILE THE LIGHTS WERE DOWN , THE GROUND CREW WENT ON TOP OF EBBETS FIELD AND RAN UP A SMALL CONFEDERATE FLAG IN HIS HONOR BECAUSE HE WAS FROM LOUISVILLE , KENTUCKY . WE GO IN THE CLUBHOUSE AFTER THE GAME . AND JACKIE IS IRATE . I MEAN , HE WAS LIVID . AND JACKIE ROBINSON WAS A MAN WHO HAD AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF RACE PRIDE AND , UH , SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE INDIGNITIES OF THAT SORT . NARRATOR : DURING THE 1955 SEASON , JACKIE ROBINSON HIT ONLY .256 AND SAT OUT ALMOST 50 GAMES , PLAGUED BY ANKLE AND KNEE INJURIES . BUT THE DODGERS , NOW LED BY ALL-STARS DUKE SNIDER , ROY CAMPANELLA , AND 20-GAME-WINNER DON NEWCOMBE , WON 98 GAMES AND CLINCHED THE NATIONAL LEAGUE PENNANT WITH 16 GAMES TO GO .  THEY WOULD AGAIN FACE THE DREADED YANKEES IN THE WORLD SERIES . ANNOUNCER : A PACKED YANKEE STADIUM FOR THE WORLD SERIES OPENER ... RIVAL MANAGERS CASEY STENGEL FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES , WALT ALSTON FOR THE DODGERS . THE PITCH . AND JACKIE ROBINSON , ON THIRD , STREAKS IN TO STEAL HOME !  " SAFE , " SAYS UMPIRE SUMMERS , AND THE RHUBARB IS ON . ERSKINE : AT THIS POINT IN HIS CAREER , HE WAS NOT AS FAST . HE WAS N'T AS QUICK . HE WAS HEAVIER . HE WENT AGAINST ALL THE ODDS . THAT STEALING OF HOME WAS JACKIE 'S WAY OF MAKING A STATEMENT . NARRATOR : IT WAS THE 19th TIME THAT JACKIE ROBINSON HAD DONE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS IN ALL OF SPORTS ... STEAL HOME . AND EVEN THOUGH THE YANKEES WON THAT GAME , JACKIE 'S DARING MOVE GALVANIZED THE DODGERS . ONCE AGAIN , THE SERIES WENT TO 7 GAMES . AL HELFER : STARTS INTO HIS WINDUP . HERE 'S THE 1-1 PITCH . IT 'S A CURVE BALL HIT ON INTO RIGHT CENTER FIELD . GOING ... NARRATOR : BUT THIS TIME , THE DODGERS TOOK A 2-0 LEAD INTO THE NINTH . JOHNNY PODRES INTO HIS WINDUP AND THE 2-2 PITCH ... A LOT OF CURVE . A GROUND BALL TO LEFT SIDE . PEE WEE REESE HAS IT . THE THROW TO FIRST ... AND HE 'S OUT . AND THE DODGERS WIN ! THEY 'RE GRABBING JOHNNY PODRES , THEY 'RE PUMMELING HIM , PUSHING HIM AROUND . ANNOUNCER : MAN , OH , BOY . OH , PODRES . THIS ... THIS WAS SOMETHING . THIS WAS AS FINE A WORLD SERIES BALL GAME THAT EVER HAS BEEN PLAYED ALMOST , AND CERTAINLY NOBODY ... NARRATOR : AFTER 72 SEASONS OF BIG-LEAGUE BASEBALL IN BROOKLYN AND EIGHT FAILED TRIPS TO THE WORLD SERIES , THE DODGERS AND JACKIE ROBINSON WERE FINALLY CHAMPIONS . ERSKINE : WE WENT UP THE RUNWAY AT YANKEE STADIUM INTO THE VISITORS ' CLUBHOUSE . THERE WAS NOT THE BURST OF EXCITEMENT AND THE CHAMPAGNE RIGHT AWAY . THERE WAS VERY QUIET THE FIRST FEW MOMENTS WE GOT IN THERE , AND I FELT IT . I FELT ALMOST A SPIRITUAL FEELING ABOUT THIS ... THIS EXPERIENCE . JACKIE . AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO , THERE WAS JUST REVERENCE ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE ... BEFORE NEWCOMBE , PEE WEE , AND DUKE POPPED THE CHAMPAGNE . AND THEN ON , IT WAS JUST , BLEW THE TOP OFF ALL NIGHT IN BROOKLYN . NEVER BEEN THE SAME . HOW DO YOU FEEL ? OH , I FEEL GREAT . UH , THERE 'S NO WAY ... NO OTHER WAY TO FEEL BUT GREAT AFTER YOU WIN THE WORLD SERIES . JACKIE : CA N'T HARDLY TALK . BOY , THIS IS SOMETHING , I TELL YOU . REPORTER : YOU WAIT A LONG TIME FOR THIS ONE , JACKIE ? JACKIE : YES , WE HAVE , AND WE GOT IT NOW ! AND WE 'RE GON NA GET A LOT MORE BEFORE IT 'S OVER ... RACHEL ROBINSON : HE WAS BEYOND EXCITED . IT WAS THE PINNACLE OF WHAT HE HAD HOPED FOR AND HAD WAITED SO LONG FOR . A PROTRACTED BUS BOYCOTT FOLLOWED . " THE MORE I READ ABOUT THE MONTGOMERY SITUATION , " JACKIE WROTE , " THE MORE RESPECT I HAVE FOR THE JOB THEY ARE DOING . " AMONG THE LEADERS OF THE BOYCOTT WAS A YOUNG MINISTER FROM ATLANTA NAMED MARTIN LUTHER KING JR . AS A STUDENT AT MOREHOUSE COLLEGE , HE HAD BEEN INSPIRED BY ROBINSON 'S BREAKING OF THE COLOR LINE AND PRAISED THE AFRICAN AMERICAN PIONEER FOR " SHAKING THE GATES . " MARTIN LUTHER KING JR ; WHEN YOU SIT DOWN ON THE BUS AND YOU SIT DOWN IN THE FRONT OR YOU SIT DOWN BY A WHITE PERSON , YOU ARE SITTING THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DUTY TO SIT THERE , NOT MERELY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A RIGHT . CROWDMEMBERSCHEER , SPEAKEXCITEDLY  RACHEL ROBINSON : IN 1956 , JACK WAS N'T IN PEAK CONDITION . AND HE KNEW IT . HE JUST DID N'T FEEL AS UP FOR THE GAME AS ... AS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN . HE ALSO SENSED THAT THE OWNERS WERE BEGINNING TO TAKE THAT SAME POSITION ABOUT HIM . NARRATOR : NURSING STIFF JOINTS AND SORE LEGS , ROBINSON MUDDLED THROUGH THE 1956 SEASON . HE PLAYED THIRD , SECOND , FIRST , AND THE OUTFIELD ... WHEREVER THE MANAGER PUT HIM . BRYANT : MY FAVORITE PERIOD IN SPORTS IS THE PERIOD WHEN THE PLAYER HAS DIMINISHED BUT THE FIRE STILL ALLOWS THEM TO BE GREAT IN SMALL MOMENTS . THEY CA N'T DO IT OVER A FULL SEASON , BUT WHEN IT COUNTS , THEY CAN STILL GET YOU . BY 1956 , HE WAS DONE AS AN EVERYDAY PLAYER . HE WAS ABLE TO CONJURE UP ALL THE OLD MAGIC . HE COULD N'T DO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY , BUT HE COULD BURY YOU , AND HE DID . ANNOUNCER : EVERY GAME HAS ITS HEROES ... NARRATOR : ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE SEASON , ROBINSON HIT A HOME RUN TO HELP BROOKLYN CLINCH THE PENNANT . BUT IN THE WORLD SERIES , THE YANKEES BEAT THE DODGERS IN 7 GAMES AGAIN . ANNOUNCER : A TEAR GROWS IN BROOKLYN AS JACKIE ROBINSON IS THE LAST OUT AS THE NEW YORK YANKEES REGAIN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP . NARRATOR : THAT FALL , RUMORS SURFACED THAT ROBINSON WAS BEING CONSIDERED TO MANAGE THE MONTREAL ROYALS . RACHEL ROBINSON : NEITHER RICKEY NOR O'MALLEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD BE A MANAGER OR ENCOURAGED HIM TO BE A MANAGER . IT WAS N'T SOMETHING HE WAS GON NA FIGHT FOR . I THINK HE WAS GON NA WAIT TILL IT WAS BESTOWED ON HIM BY THEM , AND THEY DID N'T . AND HE WALKED AWAY FROM IT . BEFORE NEWS OF ROBINSON 'S RETIREMENT BECAME PUBLIC , THE DODGERS STUNNED THE BASEBALL WORLD BY TRADING HIM TO THE NEW YORK GIANTS . ERSKINE : HOW ... HOW COULD YOU EVER TRADE JACKIE ROBINSON , AND TO THE GIANTS ? ! ' CAUSE WHEN YOU SAY TED WILLIAMS , YOU KNOW IT 'S THE RED SOX . MUSIAL IS THE CARDINALS . DIMAGGIO IS THE YANKEES . THE DODGERS IS JACKIE . NARRATOR : WHEN ROBINSON 'S PLAN TO LEAVE THE GAME AND JOIN CHUCK FULL O'NUTS LEAKED , THE DODGERS FRONT OFFICE SUGGESTED THAT JACKIE WAS JUST TRYING TO GET A HIGHER SALARY FROM THE GIANTS . SOME ACCUSED HIM OF INGRATITUDE . FRANK LANE , THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE CARDINALS SAID , " I 'D SAY THAT MR . ROBINSON OWES EVERYTHING HE HAS TO BASEBALL . " BUT OTHERS DEFENDED HIM . " IF THERE IS AN UNFULFILLED OBLIGATION IN THE CASE OF BASEBALL VS . " BRYANT : THEY COULD NOT WAIT TO GET RID OF HIM . THEY COULD N'T WAIT TO NOT HAVE TO HEAR HIM ANYMORE COMPLAIN THAT THE YANKEES WERE N'T INTEGRATING AND COMPLAIN THAT THE RED SOX WERE N'T INTEGRATING AND COMPLAIN THAT THERE WAS NO THIRD-BASE COACHES THAT WERE BLACK . ROBINSON UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT YOU WERE GIVING HIM BY PUTTING HIM IN UNIFORM WAS N'T ENOUGH . IT WAS NEVER GON NA BE ENOUGH UNTIL HE GOT EVERYTHING , WHICH IS FULL PARTNERSHIP IN THE AMERICAN DREAM .  ED CHARLES : WE WERE JACKIE DISCIPLES . JACK WAS INTEGRATING THE MAJOR LEAGUES . NOW WE GOT TO INTEGRATE THE MINOR LEAGUES . AND THAT WAS PRETTY TOUGH . THERE WAS TIMES I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO QUIT , BUT THEN I WOULD THINK ABOUT JACKIE AND WHAT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH . IF JACKIE DID N'T QUIT , I 'M NOT GON NA QUIT . MINNIE MINOSO : WE ARE LIKE A CLOWN . IF JACKIE MAKE IT , I MAKE IT . AND I SAID , " I HAVE A CHANCE . " MICHELLE OBAMA : SO MANY OF US , I KNOW , GROWING UP , WERE TAUGHT BY OUR PARENTS AND OUR GRANDPARENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN GOOD . YOU HAVE TO BE TWICE AS GOOD . A LOT OF THAT COMES FROM LOOKING AT PEOPLE LIKE JACKIE ROBINSON . THOSE OPPORTUNITIES DO N'T COME UNLESS YOU 'RE READY FOR THEM . AND YOU HAVE TO BE READY THAN ... MORE READY THAN MOST . NARRATOR : JACKIE ROBINSON 'S LEGACY IN BASEBALL WAS SUBSTANTIAL AND LONG-LASTING . BLACK PLAYERS WERE NOW ON NEARLY EVERY ROSTER . AND IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE , THEY WON THE MVP AWARD 9 OUT OF 11 YEARS . ROBINSON 'S FORBEARANCE AND DETERMINATION HAD OPENED THE DOOR FOR LATIN AS WELL AS AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS , INCLUDING MANY OF THE GREATEST STARS WHO EVER PLAYED THE GAME . LAWRENCE SPIVAK : MR . ROBINSON , HOW DO YOU ... HOW DO YOU ANSWER THOSE PEOPLE WHO INSIST THAT THE NAACP IS MOVING VERY , VERY FAST TO GET THE RIGHTS OF THE NEGRO ? JACKIE : WELL , WHEN THEY SAY THAT THE NAACP IS MOVING TOO FAST , UH , " TAKE YOUR TIME , BE PATIENT , " THE NEGRO HAS PROVEN BEYOND A DOUBT THAT WE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN PATIENT . AND THE CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN OVER ABOUT 93 YEARS . AND IF THAT IS N'T PATIENCE , I DO N'T KNOW WHAT IS . MARTY EDELMAN : HE WAS ON TO THE NEXT PART OF HIS LIFE . HE HAD A NEW WORLD THAT HE WAS GON NA TAKE ON AND EMBRACE . AND IT HAD SOME ... HAD BUSINESS AND POLITICS AND A CHANGE IN THE WAY HE AND RACHEL LIVED . AND I THINK HE SAID , YOU KNOW , " I ... I 'M LOOKING FORWARD ... " NARRATOR : AS JACKIE ROBINSON 'S BASEBALL CAREER CAME TO AN END , THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE HAD AWARDED HIM ITS HIGHEST HONOR , THE SPINGARN MEDAL . PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS INCLUDED W.E.B . DU BOIS , A . PHILIP RANDOLPH , MARY McLEOD BETHUNE , AND THURGOOD MARSHALL . ROBINSON RAISED MONEY FOR THE NAACP IN SCHOOLS , CHURCHES , AND COMMUNITY AUDITORIUMS FROM BALTIMORE TO OAKLAND , CHALLENGING BLACKS TO FIGHT FOR FIRST-CLASS CITIZENSHIP , AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO VOTE .  IN MARCH 1957 , ROBINSON BEGAN WORKING AT CHOCK FULL O'NUTS . COMMUTING EACH DAY FROM STAMFORD TO MANHATTAN , HE THREW HIMSELF INTO LEARNING THE COMPANY 'S OPERATIONS , MASTERING WAGE SCALES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS , AND GETTING TO KNOW THE MOSTLY BLACK WORKFORCE , WHOSE CONCERNS HE WAS EAGER TO ADDRESS .  AT HOME ON CASCADE ROAD , JACKIE SETTLED INTO A REGULAR FAMILY ROUTINE FOR THE FIRST TIME . SHARON ROBINSON : MY SPECIAL TIME WITH MY DAD WAS GOING INTO NEW YORK CITY . AND MY FATHER LOVED THE SPEED AND THE HILLS . AND SO IT WAS ALL TRUE EXCITEMENT , BUT REALLY IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF US . NARRATOR : BUT IN NEARLY ALL-WHITE STAMFORD , DAVID , SHARON , AND JACKIE JR . WERE OFTEN THE ONLY BLACK CHILDREN IN THEIR CLASSROOMS AND ON THE TEAMS AND CLUBS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO JOIN . ON JACKIE JUNIOR 'S FIRST DAY OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL , HE AND RACHEL HAD BEEN MET BY ROWS OF WHITE STUDENTS WHO POINTED AND STARED . " OH , LOOK AT THE LITTLE COLORED BOY , " SHE HEARD ONE WHISPER . HIS YOUNGER BROTHER DAVID HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE . DAVID ROBINSON : TO THINK ABOUT MYSELF INTEGRATING FIRST GRADE , ONE BLACK IN A SCHOOL OF 900 , THERE WAS DISCRIMINATION ; THEY LET ME IN THE SCHOOL BUT I COULD NOT GO TO THE ... THE COUNTRY CLUBS , I COULD NOT GO TO THE HOCKEY RINK ... OR CHANGE THE WORLD . IT WAS THE NEAREST SCHOOL TO OUR HOME , AND IT HAD AVERY GOOD REPUTATION FOR EDUCATING CHILDREN . SO DAVID JUST HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH IT . SHARON ROBINSON : WE DID N'T EVEN TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR US TO DESEGREGATE OUR SCHOOLS IN CONNECTICUT . WE WERE JUST GOING TO SCHOOL AND THEY WERE SAYING , " DO YOU TAKE A BATH ? " BUT WE DID N'T TALK ABOUT HOW THAT WAS AFFECTING US . WE DID N'T TALK ABOUT THAT AT HOME BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING EXTERNAL WAS SO BIG . WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE ROCK NINE . SO THERE WAS A SORT OF SHELTERING AND SORT OF A DENIAL ALMOST OF ... OF OUR OWN PAIN . NARRATOR : IN 1959 , JACKIE ROBINSON AND A YOUNG WRITER NAMED BILL BRANCH BEGAN COLLABORATING ON A WEEKLY COLUMN FOR THE LIBERAL " NEW YORK POST " UNDER ROBINSON 'S BYLINE . WILLIAM BRANCH : WHITES JUST ASSUMED THAT BLACKS HAD THE SAME PERSPECTIVES THAT THEY HAD . SO THE COLUMN MADE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION IN INFORMING WHITES , PARTICULARLY , OF ATTITUDES AND EVENTS , UH , AND PERSPECTIVES FROM THE BLACK COMMUNITY . NARRATOR : IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE SPORTS SECTION , BUT ROBINSON IMMEDIATELY BEGAN FOCUSING ON ISSUES OUTSIDE ATHLETICS . THE COLUMN DREW ATTENTION TO A MISSISSIPPI LYNCHING , CRITICIZED THE BIGOTRY OF WHITE LONG ISLAND RESIDENTS WHO RESISTED SCHOOL INTEGRATION , AND ACCUSED THE RED SOX , NOW THE ONLY BIG LEAGUE TEAM WITHOUT A SINGLE BLACK PLAYER , OF PREJUDICE . AND HE PROMISED TO TAKE A CAREFUL LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES IN THE UPCOMING 1960 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION . MAN AS JACKIE : I GUESS YOU 'D CALL ME AN INDEPENDENT . AS A NEGRO , I 'VE BEEN WOOED BY THE DEMOCRATS WITH THE MEMORY OF FRANKLIN D . ROOSEVELT AND THE NEW DEAL ... AND CULTIVATED BY THE REPUBLICANS WITH THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE CIVIL WAR . MICHAEL LONG : ROBINSON 'S DREAM WAS A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM IN WHICH AFRICAN AMERICANS SUSPEND THEIR VOTE UNTIL THEY CAN DETERMINE WHICH PARTY OR WHICH CANDIDATE IS GOING TO BEST ADVANCE THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS AGENDA . ROBINSON THOUGHT IT WAS A TRAGEDY THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE SO WILLING TO GO TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AS A BLOCK . HE THOUGHT THAT THEY LOST LEVERAGE WHEN THEY DID THAT . I KNOW THAT IT IS N'T JUST A SOUTHERN PROBLEM . I KNOW THAT IT 'S A NORTHERN PROBLEM AND A WESTERN PROBLEM AND AN EASTERN PROBLEM AND THAT ALL OF US HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT ... NARRATOR : VICE PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON WAS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE . ROBINSON AND NIXON HAD BEEN FREQUENT CORRESPONDENTS SINCE THEIR FIRST MEETING IN 1952 . " I HAVE DEVELOPED A DEEP SENSE OF APPRECIATION " FOR YOUR CONSTANT EFFORTS TO PROVIDE A GREATER MEASURE OF JUSTICE FOR NEGRO AMERICANS , " WROTE JACKIE . " LONG : NIXON DID NOT HAVE A GOOD RECORD ON CIVIL RIGHTS . BUT ROBINSON BELIEVED THAT NIXON HAD ACTUALLY DEVELOPED , HAD EVOLVED ON THE ISSUE OF CIVIL RIGHTS . MAN AS ROBINSON : NIXON SEEMS VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE NEED FOR USING THE INFLUENCE AND PRESTIGE OF THE PRESIDENCY TO ADVANCE EQUAL RIGHTS . I FEEL HE HAS AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANY OF THE CURRENT CANDIDATES TO WOO AND WIN A GREAT MANY NEGRO VOTES . NARRATOR : ROBINSON WAS OPENLY SKEPTICAL OF THE DEMOCRATIC FRONTRUNNER , MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR JOHN F . KENNEDY , WHOSE STANCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS HAD BECOME INCREASINGLY CAUTIOUS AS HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS GREW . " THIS COUNTRY CAN NOT AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER PRESIDENT , " ROBINSON WROTE , " WHO LACKS THE COURAGE TO FACE SQUARELY " " THE BURNING ISSUE OF OUR TIMES : THE COLOR LINE . " BELAFONTE : JOHN F . KENNEDY DID N'T QUITE GET THE ROLE THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WOULD PLAY AT THAT TIME . TOM BROKAW : KENNEDY WORRIED ABOUT THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CARRY THE SOUTH , AND HE WORRIED IF HE GOT TOO FAR OUT IN FRONT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , HE WOULD LOSE A LOT OF SOUTHERN SUPPORT . LONG : KENNEDY HAD AGREED TO MEET WITH THE SEGREGATIONIST GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA , JOHN PATTERSON . AFTER THAT PRIVATE MEETING , GOVERNOR PATTERSON COMES OUT AND ANNOUNCES THAT JOHN F . KENNEDY , HE BELIEVES IS A FRIEND OF THE SOUTH . NARRATOR : ROBINSON WAS SO OFFENDED THAT HE REFUSED TO POSE FORA PICTURE WITH KENNEDY AT A DINNER IN NEW YORK . AND WHEN KENNEDY CHOSE TEXAS SENATOR LYNDON JOHNSON AS HIS RUNNING MATE , JACKIE DISMISSED THE SELECTION AS " A BID , " HE SAID , " FOR THE APPEASEMENT OF SOUTHERN BIGOTS . " BRANCH : THE KENNEDYS WERE SO UPSET BY JACKIE 'S COMMENTS , UH , IN THE " POST , " THEY ARRANGED A FACE-TO-FACE MEETING . ROBINSON , " " BEING FROM MASSACHUSETTS , I HAVE N'T KNOWN TOO MANY NEGROES . " AND JACK SAID , " I THOUGHT , IF YOU 'RE IN CONGRESS , " " YOU DAMN WELL BETTER MAKE IT YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW NEGROES . " NARRATOR : IN SEPTEMBER , ROBINSON TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM CHOCK FULL O'NUTS TO CAMPAIGN FULL-TIME FOR RICHARD NIXON . THE " POST " IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED HIS COLUMN . BELAFONTE : HE JUST DECIDED , " I 'M FOR NIXON . " AND THAT SENT A SHOCK OF HORROR THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY . RACHEL ROBINSON : I WAS OPPOSED TO HIS SUPPORTING NIXON OR ANY REPUBLICAN . I CAME FROM A FAMILY OF TWO GENERATIONS OF STAUNCH DEMOCRATS , AND WE COULD N'T SEE HOW HE COULD EVER GIVE ANYTHING TO THE REPUBLICANS . HOWEVER , HE WAS HIS OWN MAN , AND HE DECIDED THAT THAT 'S WHAT HE WANTED TO DO . NARRATOR : ROBINSON TRAVELED THE COUNTRY , PRAISING NIXON AND CRITICIZING KENNEDY . WAS ARRESTED IN ATLANTA , GEORGIA , FOR TAKING PART IN A LUNCH COUNTER SIT-IN . HE WAS DENIED BAIL AND SENTENCED TO SERVE 4 MONTHS ON A CHAIN GANG .  KING 'S WIFE CORETTA WAS SURE HE 'D BE KILLED . BELAFONTE : DR . KING ON A CHAIN GANG IN THE SOUTH WAS TO MAKE HIM VULNERABLE TO ALL SORTS OF VIOLENCE . AT ALL COSTS , HE HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM THE CHAIN GANG . NARRATOR : ROBINSON CORNERED HIS CANDIDATE , DESPERATE TO CONVINCE NIXON TO PLACE A PHONE CALL TO DR . KING IN PRISON AS A SYMBOL OF HIS SUPPORT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS . NIXON REFUSED . IT WOULD BE GRANDSTANDING , HE SAID . ROBINSON WAS HEARTBROKEN . " NIXON DOES N'T DESERVE TO WIN , " HE SAID TO AN AIDE AS HE LEFT THE MEETING . MEANWHILE , MEMBERS OF JOHN F . KENNEDY 'S INNER CIRCLE PERSUADED HIM TO PLACE A CALL TO CORETTA KING AND EXPRESS HIS CONCERN . KING , PENDING APPEAL . NATURALLY , I 'M VERY HAPPY TO KNOW OF SENATOR KENNEDY 'S CONCERN AND , UH , ALL THAT HE DID TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE . NARRATOR : WORD OF THE KENNEDY FAMILY 'S ACTIONS SPREAD QUICKLY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY . DR . KING HIMSELF DID NOT BACK ANY CANDIDATE , BUT HIS FATHER , THE REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING SR . , WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY ENDORSED NIXON , CHANGED ALLEGIANCES . " BECAUSE THIS MAN WAS WILLING TO WIPE THE TEARS " " FROM MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW 'S EYES , " HE SAID , " I 'VE GOT A SUITCASE FULL OF VOTES , " " AND I 'M GOING TO TAKE THEM TO MR . KENNEDY " " AND DUMP THEM IN HIS LAP . "  ON NOVEMBER 8,1960 , JOHN F . KENNEDY WON BY JUST OVER 100,000 VOTES . HE WAS SURE THAT HIS SUPPORT FOR NIXON WAS TO BLAME . THAT SAME YEAR , EBBETS FIELD , THE HOME OF THE BROOKLYN DODGERS SINCE 1913 , WAS DEMOLISHED . OWNER WALTER O'MALLEY HAD HOPED TO REPLACE THE SMALL , BELOVED BALLPARK WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART STADIUM IN BROOKLYN WITH AMPLE PARKING FOR THE WHITE FANS WHO WERE INCREASINGLY MOVING TO THE SUBURBS , BUT THE CITY HAD REFUSED TO HELP HIM ACQUIRE THE LAND . BEFORE THE 1958 SEASON , O'MALLEY HAD MOVED THE BROOKLYN DODGERS TO LOS ANGELES . RACHEL ROBINSON : JACK AND I DID HAVE AVERY SPECIAL BOND . AND IT LASTED THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES . IT GOT TESTED FROM TIME TO TIME BY EXTERNAL THINGS AND THINGS BETWEEN US . HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING ME WITH HIM EVERYWHERE . I EVEN RODE IN HIS GOLF CARTS WHILE HE PLAYED GOLF . BUT , UH , IN FACT , HE WAS OPPOSED TO IT . AND WE HAD TO WORK THROUGH THAT OVER TIME . NARRATOR : IN THE SPRING OF 1961 , RACHEL EARNED A MASTER 'S DEGREE IN NURSING AND GOT A JOB AT A HOSPITAL IN THE BRONX . " RAE HAS BEEN SO BUSY LATELY , WE HAVE N'T BEEN ABLE TO DO MANY OF THE THINGS WE LIKE DOING , " JACKIE COMPLAIN ED TO A FRIEND . " BUT SHE IS SO WRAPPED UP IN HER WORK , SHE DOES N'T MIND AT ALL . " WITH BOTH RACHEL AND JACKIE NOW WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME , THE ROBINSONS ENLISTED RACHEL 'S MOTHER ZELLEE TO HELP WITH THE KIDS . DAVID HAD FORGED CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS WITH HIS WHITE CLASSMATES , AND HE DISPLAYED A STRONG , INDEPENDENT STREAK , LIKE HIS FATHER ... INCREASINGLY WITHDRAWN , RESENTFUL OF THE CONSTANT PRESSURE TO BE LIKE HIS FATHER . SHARON ROBINSON : HE WAS NAMED JACKIE ROBINSON JR . THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR HIM TO HIDE . YOU KNOW , HE COULD N'T BE HIMSELF . RACHEL ROBINSON : HE WAS N'T PERFORMING ACADEMICALLY . HE BEGAN TO ASSOCIATE WITH CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WERE NOT DOING GOOD THINGS . AND WE DID N'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO FOR HIM OR WITH HIM . SHARON ROBINSON : I ADORED MY OLDER BROTHER , BUT HE WAS ALWAYS CREATING CHAOS IN THE HOUSE . AND THAT SORT OF CARRIED ON AND BECAME MORE CHAOTIC THE OLDER HE GOT . NARRATOR : SENT AWAY TO BOARDING SCHOOL , HE WAS SUSPENDED FOR POOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND GETTING INTO FIGHTS . RACHEL ROBINSON : JACK WOULD DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM JACKIE JR . AT TIMES BECAUSE HE FELT THAT JACKIE WAS N'T AS LOVING TOWARD HIM OR HE DID N'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE JACKIE 'S BEHAVIOR . SO HE WOULD MOVE HIMSELF OUT OF THE PICTURE . AT TIMES I MAY SEEM TO GET AWFULLY ANGRY AT YOU , BUT I HOPE YOU ARE NEVER AFRAID OF ME . I 'M ALREADY PROUD OF YOU . WILL YOU MAKE ME MORE PROUD ? PLEASE TRY , JACKIE . NARRATOR : ON JULY 23 , 1962 , IN THE TINY VILLAGE OF COOPERSTOWN , NEW YORK , 5,000 PEOPLE CAME OUT TO SEE JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON , THE GRANDSON OF SLAVES , INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME . OVER THE YEARS , ROBINSON HAD HAD HIS DIFFERENCES WITH MANY OF THE WRITERS WHOSE VOTES DETERMINED ADMISSION INTO THE HALL . BUT NOW , IN AN UNEXPECTED SHOW OF APPRECIATION , THEY HAD CHOSEN HIM IN HIS FIRST YEAR OF ELIGIBILITY .  JACKIE : I ONLY HOPE THAT I 'LL BE ABLE TO LIVE UP TO THIS TREMENDOUSLY FINE HONOR .  BRYANT : WHAT HE DID WAS DONE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF BEING THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYER , YET HIS HALL OF FAME PLAQUE DID NOT MENTION AT ALL THAT HE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO PLAY IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES . JACKIE ROBINSON 'S ABILITY TO PLAY BASEBALL AT A HALL OF FAME LEVEL IS COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE AND 100% TRUE . HOWEVER , HIS VALUE WAS THAT HE CHANGED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY . HE WAS N'T JUST A REALLY GOOD SECOND BASEMAN . HE WAS A GUY WHO TOOK ON EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE AFRAID TO FACE AND FACED IT AND SUCCEEDED . WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY , VERY GRATEFUL . RACHEL ROBINSON : BASEBALL WAS A BRIDGE TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT FOR HIM . IF HE HAD N'T BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY A LOT OF PEOPLE AND GOTTEN A LOT OF PUBLICITY , HE WOULD N'T HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO MOVE TOWARD DR . KING AND OTHERS SO THAT HE COULD ASSIST THEM IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING . NARRATOR : IN SEPTEMBER OF 1962 , AT MARTIN LUTHER KING 'S REQUEST , ROBINSON TRAVELED TO ALBANY , GEORGIA . THE CITY JAIL WAS FILLED WITH ACTIVISTS WHO HAD FOR NEARLY A YEAR BEEN USING NON-VIOLENT TACTICS TO CHALLENGE SEGREGATION , STAGING SIT-INS AND TRYING TO REGISTER BLACK VOTERS . WILLIAM ANDERSON : WE ARE MARCHING FOR FREEDOM , AND GOD IS ON OUR SIDE !  FREEDOM ! FREEDOM ! FREEDOM ! AND WE WILL NOT STOP . CHANTSOF " FREEDOM ! " CONTINUE ANDERSON , @voice_over : WE GOT SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE IN JAIL .  THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES , THEY GOT WEARY . SOME OF THEM HAD STAYED IN JAIL FOR WEEKS .  WHEN HE CAME TO TOWN , IT SAID IF HE CARED THAT MUCH ABOUT US , WE CAN CARE NO LESS ABOUT OURSELVES . AND THAT JUST MEANT WE CAN DO MUCH MORE . NARRATOR : AFTER SPEAKING TO A FULL HOUSE AT A CHURCH IN ALBANY , ROBINSON WAS DRIVEN TO NEARBY SASSER , GEORGIA , WHERE ARSONISTS HAD DESTROYED THE MOUNT OLIVE BAPTIST CHURCH . MAN AS JACKIE : IN THE BACKWOODS COMMUNITY OF SASSER , GEORGIA , I STOOD BEFORE THE SMOLDERING RUINS OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN THE MOUNT OLIVE BAPTIST CHURCH . I WATCHED A STRONG MAN , THE REVEREND F.S . SWAGGOT , WEEP AS THOUGH HIS HEART WOULD BREAK AS HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE WRECKAGE OF THE INSTITUTION INTO WHICH HE AND HIS PEOPLE HAD POURED THEIR DEVOTION AND THEIR DREAMS . THE NEGRO PEOPLE MUST REBUILD THEM TO LET THE KLANS , CITIZEN COUNCILS , AND THE WORLD KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT BE FRIGHTENED AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR LEADERS TO BE INTIMIDATED . LET 'S BUILD PROUD , NEW , GLORIOUS , TALL CHURCHES THAT WILL RISE OUT OF THE ASHES OF HATRED . NARRATOR : THE NEXT BATTLEGROUND FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WAS IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA . JACKIE : I 'M QUITE CONCERNED THAT THE PRESIDENT , IN MY OPINION , FEELS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ELECTION NEXT YEAR THAN HE IS ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF 20 MILLION HUMAN BEINGS IN THIS COUNTRY . AND I HOPE THAT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS CRISIS WILL AWAKEN HIM , BECAUSE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO DR . KING DOWN THERE , UH , I DO N'T KNOW WHAT 'S LIABLE TO HAPPEN .  NARRATOR : WHEN BULL CONNOR , BIRMINGHAM 'S COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC SAFETY , ORDERED THE POLICE TO USE ATTACK DOGS AND FIRE HOSES AGAINST PEACEFUL PROTESTERS , INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN , IMAGES OF THE VIOLENCE HORRIFIED PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD .  MAN :  FREEDOM , FREEDOM , FREEDOM ...  NARRATOR : IN MAY , ROBINSON TRAVELED TO BIRMINGHAM TO SEE THINGS FOR HIMSELF .  JACKIE : MY 3 CHILDREN WANTED TO COME DOWN HERE WITH ME , BECAUSE THEY HAD SEEN YOUR CHILDREN GOING TO JAIL FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN . AND THE AMAZING THING TO ME ABOUT ALL OF THIS IS THAT WHITE AMERICANS ARE ALLOWING A BULL CONNOR TO BE THEIR SPOKESMAN .  NARRATOR : SOUTHERN NEWSPAPERS AND SOME NORTHERN ONES , AS WELL , NOW ACCUSED ROBINSON OF BEING AN OUTSIDE AGITATOR . HE WAS UNDETERRED . " WHENEVER AND WHEREVER IN THE SOUTH THE LEADERS BELIEVE I CAN HELP JUST THE TINIEST BIT , " HE SAID , " I INTEND TO GO . "  THAT JUNE , 500 SUPPORTERS SETTLED IN ON THE SLOPING LAWN BEHIND THE HOUSE ON CASCADE ROAD TO HEAR AN ALL-STAR LINEUP OF SINGERS AND MUSICIANS . JACKIE : FIRST OF ALL , LADIES AND GENTLEMEN , LET ME ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE AND FAMILY WELCOME YOU HERE THIS AFTERNOON . EVERY PENNY THAT COMES IN WILL GO TO THE FIGHT FOR FREEDOM DOWN IN THE SOUTH . NARRATOR : ROBINSON HAD COME BACK FROM ALABAMA DETERMINED TO RAISE AS MUCH BAIL MONEY FOR PROTESTERS IN BIRMINGHAM AS HE COULD . DIZZY GILLESPIE , DAVE BRUBECK , JOYA SHERILL , BILLY TAYLOR ... " THEY ALL PLAYED FOR FREE .  BROADCASTER : FREEDOM NOW MOVEMENT , HEAR ME . WE ARE REQUESTING ALL CITIZENS TO MOVE INTO WASHINGTON , TO GO BY PLANE , BY CAR , BUS . WE ARE PUSHING FOR JOBS , HOUSING , DESEGREGATED SCHOOLS . PLEASE JOIN . GO TO WASHINGTON . NARRATOR : ON AUGUST 28 , 1963 , THE ROBINSON FAMILY JOINED MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION AMERICANS IN WASHINGTON , D.C . , IN A PEACEFUL SHOW OF HOPE AND RACIAL UNITY . RAY CHARLES :  WELL , I KNOW  BACKUP SINGERS :  YES , INDEED   IF IT HITS YOU   YES , INDEED   YOU 'LL SAY   YES , INDEED ...   WHOA , YES , YOU WILL , NOW   I WANT TO TELL YOU   YES , INDEED   IT 'S GON NA GET YOU ...   YES , INDEED ...   YES , INDEED ...  DAVID ROBINSON : I WAS 11 YEARS OLD . SINGERS :  YES , INDEED ...  IT WAS A FANTASTIC DAY FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY AND I THINK FOR US AS A NATION , US AS A RACE . SHARON ROBINSON : I REMEMBER THE FEEL OF , YOU KNOW , BEING IN A WAVE AND BEING PART OF A ... SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF . AND THAT 'S AVERY GREAT FEELING . MARCHER : NOW ! NOW ! NOW ! NOW ... CHARLES :  CLAP YOUR HANDS   KNOW YOU 'LL SAY , OH ...  SINGERS :  CLAP , CLAP ...  A ' WHO-GA A '  YES , INDEED   EYES , INDEED  MARTIN LUTHER KING : WE REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE BANK OF JUSTICE IS BANKRUPT . WE REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE GREAT VAULTS OF OPPORTUNITY OF THIS NATION ...  NARRATOR : " I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO PROUD " " TO BE A NEGRO , " ROBINSON WROTE . " I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN . " MARCHERS :  OH , TODA-A-AY   OH , DEEP IN MY HEART ...  YOHURU WILLIAMS : THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON IS A WATERSHED MOMENT IN THE MOVEMENT ITSELF . BUT THIS WAS ALSO A TURNING POINT IN TERMS OF THE VIOLENCE THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH THE MOVEMENT . AND THE ESCALATION OF OPPOSITION ... BECAUSE THE FEAR IS THAT A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL IS COMING . IT 'S ONLY A MONTH LATER THAT YOU HAVE THE BOMBING OF THE 16th STREET BAPTIST CHURCH IN BIRMINGHAM , ALABAMA , AND THE KILLING OF FOUR LITTLE GIRLS . MALCOLM X : HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY BEING NON-VIOLENT IN MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA WHEN YOUR CHURCHES ARE BEING BOMBED AND YOUR LITTLE GIRLS ARE BEING MURDERED ? AND AT THE SAME TIME ... THE FIRST SPEAKER WAS A CHARISMATIC MINISTER FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM WHO HAD DEVELOPED A DEVOTED FOLLOWING BY CONDEMNING NON-VIOLENT MEASURES AND PREACHING INDEPENDENCE FROM WHITES . HIS NAME WAS MALCOLM X . AS A 21-YEAR-OLD SERVING TIME IN A MASSACHUSETTS PRISON FOR BURGLARY , MALCOLM LITTLE HAD FOLLOWED EACH AT-BAT OF JACKIE 'S ROOKIE SEASON . ROBINSON , HE REMEMBERED , " HAD HIS MOST FANATIC FAN IN ME . " WHEN JACKIE RETURNED TO THE STAGE TO END THE HARLEM RALLY , THE CROWD HAD BEGUN CHANTING , " WE WANT MALCOLM ! " SOON , THEY HAD GROWN MORE BOISTEROUS , DROWNING OUT ROBINSON . MALCOLM X HAD BEEN WATCHING FROM IN FRONT OF A NEARBY CHOCK FULL O'NUTS COFFEE SHOP . HE CLIMBED UP ON THE PLATFORM AGAIN AND ENCOURAGED EVERYONE TO GO HOME . THE CROWD DISPERSED . JOHN F . KENNEDY HAD ONCE OFFERED ONLY TEPID SUPPORT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS , BUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAD MOTIVATED HIM TO ACT , AND IN THE LAST MONTHS OF HIS LIFE , HE HAD PUSHED FOR A SWEEPING CIVIL RIGHTS BILL .  JOHNSON 'S ENDORSEMENT OF THAT BILL , WARNED A PROMINENT GEORGIA DEMOCRAT , WOULD COST THEIR PARTY THE SOUTH FOREVER . MAN AS JACKIE : REPUBLICANS , SHREWDLY VIEWING THE DISCOMFORT OVER THE ADMINISTRATION 'S CIVIL RIGHTS STANCE , ARE WEIGHING THE DELICATE QUESTION OF HOW TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS RESENTMENT . THEY WANT THE G.O.P . TO BECOME THE WHITE MAN 'S PARTY .  OUR AIM IS TO PRESERVE A FREE SOCIETY .   NARRATOR : AS THE 1964 PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTIONS APPROACHED , ARIZONA SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER , THE CANDIDATE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY , QUICKLY BECAME THE GOP FRONTRUNNER . SINGERS :  GO , GOLDWATER   LET 'S GO , GOLDWATER   LET 'S GO FOR HONEST LEADERSHIP ...  BROKAW : BARRY GOLDWATER , " IN YOUR HEART , YOU KNOW HE 'S RIGHT . " THAT WAS THE MOTTO . HE WAS AVERY CONSERVATIVE GUY . HE GREW UP IN THE SOUTHWEST . HE HAD THAT KIND OF A FRONTIER MENTALITY ABOUT , YOU , UH , " YOU GET WHAT YOU EARN AND YOU ... TAKE WHAT YOU GET . " NARRATOR : " WE 'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE NEGRO VOTE " " IN 1964 OR 1968 , " GOLDWATER HAD TOLD SOUTHERN PARTY LEADERS . " LET 'S GO HUNTING WHERE THE DUCKS ARE . " " THE LILY-WHITE LEADERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY " " ARE EXHIBITING A GENIUS FOR MISREADING CURRENT EVENTS , " ROBINSON WARNED CONSERVATIVES . THERE 'S NO WAY TO " WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION , " HE SAID , " WITHOUT THE NEGRO VOTE . "  HE ENCOURAGED REPUBLICANS TO LINE UP BEHIND NEW YORK GOVERNOR NELSON A . ROCKEFELLER . AND IN FEBRUARY OF 1964 , HE JOINED ROCKEFELLER 'S CAMPAIGN . ROBINSON SPOKE ON THE GOVERNOR 'S BEHALF TO BLACK AUDIENCES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY . " THIS IS A STRUGGLE , " HE TOLD ONE AUDIENCE IN MINNESOTA , " TO REGAIN THE SOUL OF AMERICA . AT LEAST IN LAW , IT PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE . A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAD VOTED FOR IT . BARRY GOLDWATER HAD NOT . GEORGE WILL : HE VOTED AGAINST THAT , AND AT THAT POINT THERE IS A DRAMATIC , PROBABLY IRREPARABLE RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY . NARRATOR : ROCKEFELLER 'S CAMPAIGN NEVER CAUGHT FIRE . BY THE TIME THE REPUBLICANS CONVENED IN SAN FRANCISCO , THE NOMINATION WAS GOLDWATER 'S .  ROBINSON WAS ONE OF MORE THAN 30,000 PEOPLE WHO MARCHED THROUGH THE CITY TO PROTEST THE NEW EXTREMISM OF THE PARTY OF LINCOLN .  I WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING , I AM AN AMERICAN NEGRO FIRST BEFORE I AM A MEMBER OF ANY PARTY .  THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEGROES WHO FEEL THIS VERY SAME WAY . AND WE WILL NOT STAND SILENTLY FOR ANY MAJOR PARTY NOMINATING A MAN WHO IN MY OPINION IS A BIGOT AND A MAN WHO WILL ATTEMPT TO PREVENT US FROM MOVING FORWARD . THEY WERE THREATENED , VERBALLY ABUSED , A FEW DETAINED BY SECURITY . GEORGE LEE OF TENNESSEE , A DELEGATE TO EVERY REPUBLICAN CONVENTION SINCE 1940 , HAD HIS CREDENTIALS REVOKED . WILLIAM YOUNG OF PENNSYLVANIA , A FORMER CATCHER FOR THE HOMESTEAD GRAYS OF THE NEGRO LEAGUES , HAD CIGARETTE BUTTS PUT OUT ON HIS SUIT JACKET BY GOLDWATER SUPPORTERS . THEY ENCOURAGE DISUNITY ... NARRATOR : DURING A SPEECH BY ROCKEFELLER , AN ANGRY DELEGATE FROM ALABAMA ROSE TO CONFRONT ROBINSON , WHO WAS  ON THE GOVERNOR . THE DELEGATE 'S WIFE RESTRAINED HER HUSBAND . " TURN HIM LOOSE , LADY , " JACKIE SHOUTED . " TURN HIM LOOSE . " SHE DID N'T . ON NOVEMBER 3,1964 , LYNDON JOHNSON WAS ELECTED IN A LANDSLIDE . HE HAD WON WITH 94% OF THE BLACK VOTE INCLUDING JACKIE ROBINSON 'S . MALCOLM X : THE BLACK PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AT THE HANDS OF THE WHITE MAN FOR 400 YEARS . AND FOLLOWING THE IGNORANT " UH , NEGRO PREACHERS , WE HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GODLIKE TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK TO THE BRUTE THAT WAS BRUTALIZING US ... RACHEL ROBINSON : JACK OPPOSED ANY FORM OF VIOLENCE . EVEN THE RHETORIC THAT GOES WITH VIOLENCE HE OPPOSED . SO IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO SUPPORT MALCOLM X WHEN HE WAS SAYING , " BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY " BECAUSE THAT MEANT TO YOUNG PEOPLE , DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO . AND JACK WAS AFRAID OF THAT . HE THOUGHT THE MILITANCY WOULD LEAD TO DISASTER . " YOU WERE SUBSERVIENT TO BRANCH RICKEY . " AND NOW YOU 'RE SUBSERVIENT TO NELSON ROCKEFELLER . YOU HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH THE BLACK MASSES . "  SHARON ROBINSON : MY FATHER SAID THE BALLOT AND THE BUCK ARE THE WAYS TO IMPROVE LIFE FOR BLACK PEOPLE . WE HAD FOUGHT TO GET THE RIGHT TO VOTE . BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP . HE FELT THE NEXT MOVEMENT HAD TO BE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT . AND THAT WAS GON NA BE CRITICAL TO OUR ADVANCEMENT AS A PEOPLE .  LONG : MALCOLM X SAID , " LOOK , I DO N'T WANT TO SIT " " JUST AT THE COUNTER . " " I WANT TO OWN THE SAUCER , I WANT TO OWN THE CUP , " " I WANT TO OWN THE RESTAURANT . " AND ROBINSON LIKED TO QUOTE THAT IN HIS SPEECHES . BILL RYAN : THE STEREOTYPE OF THE NEGRO AS A BAD CREDIT RISK PERSISTED . FREEDOM NATIONAL HAS ALREADY DISPROVED THIS MYTH . NARRATOR : SOON , THE BANK OPENED A SECOND BRANCH IN THE BEDFORD-STUYVESANT SECTION OF BROOKLYN . REPORTER : WORLD KNOWN SPORTS FIGURE AND NOW SOMEWHAT OF A POLITICAL LUMINARY , YOU 'RE ALSO QUITE A BUSINESSMAN . WELL , I HAD NATURAL BASEBALL TALENTS . I DO N'T HAVE NATURAL BUSINESS TALENTS . YOU DO N'T ? YOU DO N'T ? I DO N'T HAVE NATURAL , NO . I HAVE TO LEARN THIS . I THINK THAT THIS IS THE NEXT FRONTIER ... BUSINESS AND POLITICS . WE 'RE ONLY HOPING THAT , UH , WE CAN GET THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT HERE AS WE DID AT EBBETS FIELD . NARRATOR : THREE YEARS AFTER IT OPENED , FREEDOM NATIONAL BANK WOULD BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BLACK-RUN BANK IN THE COUNTRY . " HE SAID , " I NEED DISCIPLINE . I NEED INSTRUCTIONS . " " I NEED TO KNOW WHERE I 'M HEADED . " AND ON THAT VERY DAY , HE WALKED IN AND JOINED THE ARMY . AND ONE YEAR LATER , THEY HAD HIM IN VIETNAM .  NARRATOR : JACKIE JR . WAS PART OF AN EARLY WAVE OF AMERICAN GROUND TROOPS .  IN A LETTER TO HIS FATHER , HE WROTE , " THIS IS THE MOST MISERABLE PLACE IN THE WORLD . I CA N'T SEE WHY WE 'RE FIGHTING FOR IT . "  ON NOVEMBER 19 , 1965 , THE DAY AFTER HE TURNED 19 , JACKIE JR . WAS WOUNDED IN AN AMBUSH . THE TWO MEN STANDING BESIDE HIM WERE KILLED . HE HAD TRIED TO SAVE ONE OF THE MEN , DRAGGING HIM FROM THE BATTLEFIELD UNDER FIRE , BUT IT WAS TOO LATE . JACKIE JR . BEGAN HAVING NIGHTMARES AND USING MARIJUANA AND OPIUM . AND I 'D BE IN MY ROOM , IN MY BED , BUT JUST LISTENING OUT TILL I HEARD THE CAR COME IN , KNOWING HE 'D GOTTEN HOME SAFE . AND THEN I 'D WAN NA COVER MY EARS BECAUSE I WOULD N'T WANT HIM ... TO HEAR HIM GET IN AN ARGUMENT WITH MY FATHER . I just_just  WANTED HIM TO BE SAFE . WOMEN :  NO MORE BROTHERS IN JAIL  MEN :  OFF THE PIGS !   THE PIGS ARE GON NA GET KILLED   OFF THE PIGS   THE PIGS ARE GON NA GET KILLED   OFF THE PIGS  NARRATOR : AS LEGISLATION FAILED TO PRODUCE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS , MORE AND MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE BECOMING RADICALIZED , REJECTING INTEGRATION IN FAVOR OF SEPARATION . STOKELY CARMICHAEL : WE WANT BLACK POWER ! WE WANT BLACK POWER ... CROWD : BLACK POWER ! BLACK POWER IS NOT JUST A MERE SLOGAN . SHARON ROBINSON : I WAS ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE BLACK PANTHERS , SO I BROUGHT HOME A POSTER OF HUEY NEWTON , PUT IT ON MY WALL . NOW HERE 'S MY DEGAS RIGHT ON THE OTHER WALL . AND I 'VE GOT HUEY ON THIS WALL . AND I 'M LAYING BACK IN MY BED . I 'M LOOKIN ' AT MY GORGEOUS HUEY NEWTON . AND MY FATHER COMES HOME FROM WORK . AND HE LOOKS , SAYS ... STOPS IN MY ROOM , SAYS HELLO . AND HE GOES , LOOKS AT THE POSTER . HE SAID , " NOT IN MY HOUSE . GET THAT POSTER OFF THE WALL ! " I 'M LIKE , " WHY ? " AND HE EXPLAINS TO ME THAT THE PANTHERS ARE REVOLUTIONARIES AND THAT 'S NOT A GOOD MOVEMENT FOR BLACK PEOPLE . HE SAID , " THEY CAN NOT FIGHT PHYSICALLY WITH GUNS AND WIN . " YOU KNOW , " IT HAS TO BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF A MOVEMENT . "  DO N'T PUT ..... DO N'T PUT YOUR HAND ON THE GUN .  NARRATOR : IN 1967 , RIOTS BROKE OUT IN NEW YORK NEIGHBORHOODS FROM HARLEM TO BUFFALO 'S EAST SIDE , AS AFRICAN AMERICANS PROTESTED AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AND DECADES OF BROKEN PROMISES . ROBINSON , NOW WORKING FULL-TIME FOR GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER , TRAVELED THE STATE , LISTENING TO THE GRIEVANCES OF FRUSTRATED BLACKS AND URGING PATIENCE ... THE VERY THING THAT HAD ENRAGED HIM FOR DECADES . MAN : THE MAYOR MADE A STATEMENT TO THE NEWS MEDIA THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS POLICE BRUTALITY . JACKIE : WELL , I , I ... WELL ... AND THIS IS GOING ON , AND OUR WOMEN ARE BEING BEATEN . THEY CAME MARCHING DOWN THE STREET JUST THE WAY THE NAZI SOLDIERS DID IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND OPENED FIRE ON PEOPLE FOR NO REASON AT ALL . WOMAN : IF THE BUFFALO YOUTH BOARD AND THE CITY RECREATION DEPARTMENT HAD DONE THEIR JOB AND PROPERLY ... WELL , MAY I SAY ONE ... AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND ALLOWING US TO SPEAK TO YOU TONIGHT . NARRATOR : AT ONE STOP , ACTIVISTS MOCKED ROBINSON 'S HIGH-PITCHED VOICE AND LOBBED BASEBALLS BACK AND FORTH OVER THE CONGREGATION WHILE HE SPOKE . A HARLEM MAGAZINE ACCUSED ROBINSON OF BEING GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER 'S " GOOD NIGGER . " OTHERS CALLED HIM AN UNCLE TOM . WILLIAMS : JACKIE ROBINSON IN THE 19403 IS THIS SYMBOL OF BLACK MASCULINITY . BY THE 1960S , THAT NARRATIVE HAS CHANGED .  AND WHAT YOU SEE WITH PEOPLE LIKE MUHAMMAD ALI AND JIM BROWN IS A MUCH MORE MILITANT , IN-YOUR-FACE VIEW OF BLACK MASCULINITY . AND WHAT THEY SEE IS THAT THE OLD MANNER OF BLACK RESPECTABILITY IS LIMITING BECAUSE WHAT IT DENIES IS THE FULL EXPRESSION OF HUMANITY , OF BLACK HUMANITY . BY THE LATE 19603 , THAT SAME DIGNITY AND RESTRAINT IS FROWNED UPON AND SEEN AS UNMANLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT AGGRESSIVE AND IS NOT AS MILITANT . AND THE HERO BECAME THE ATH ... BIG ATHLETIC HERO WAS MUHAMMAD ALI . AND HE REFUSES TO ACCEPT INDUCTION INTO THE ARMY . THE REAL ENEMIES OF MY PEOPLE ARE RIGHT HERE , NOT IN VIETNAM . OH , I THINK THAT HE 'S HURTING ... I THINK THE MORALE OF A LOT OF YOUNG NEGRO SOLDIERS OVER IN VIETNAM , AND THE TRAGEDY TO ME IS THAT CASSIUS HAS MADE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC . AND NOW HE 'S NOT WILLING TO SHOW HIS APPRECIATION TO A COUNTRY THAT IS GIVING HIM , IN MY VIEW , A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY . YOU WERE BORN FREE . YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE THAT RIGHT , BROTHER ... NARRATOR : ROBINSON CHARGED NEWSPAPERS , BLACK AND WHITE , WITH MAKING TOO MUCH OF YOUNG MILITANTS LIKE H . RAP BROWN . BUT HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE NAACP FOR BEING TOO MODERATE AND FOR REFUSING TO PROMOTE YOUNGER , MORE AGGRESSIVE LEADERS FROM WITHIN ITS RANKS . EVEN WHEN YOU CAN MAKE ARGUMENTS THAT ... THAT ELEMENTS OF THE ... THE BLACK CULTURE REJECTED HIM FOR BEING OUT OF TOUCH , HE HAD HIS VISION ABOUT HOW TO GET THERE , AND HE NEVER STOPPED . WE CAN NOT , UH , EXCLUDE ANY MEANS , EXCEPT VIOLENCE . I DO N'T GO FOR THAT , BUT ANY OTHER MEANS ... BARACK OBAMA : JACKIE ROBINSON FELT AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK OUT . ANY OF US WHO FIND OURSELVES IN POSITIONS OF POWER WHERE OUR VOICE MATTERS , UH , WHERE WE ARE HEARD , HAVE TO DO A CONSTANT GUT CHECK . ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT VOICE IS ACTIVE ON BEHALF OF THE VALUES , THAT , UH , THAT ARE DEEPEST IN US , THAT MATTER MOST TO US ? NARRATOR : ON MARCH 4 , 1968 , A REPORTER CALLED JACKIE , WONDERING IF HE CARED TO COMMENT ON HIS SON 'S ARREST . JACKIE : WELL , I THINK THIS IS MAYBE ... IT 'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH ME . I WAS CONSTANTLY GOING AND COMING HOME LATE IN THE EVENINGS , AND BASICALLY TIRED AND ... AND FEELING THAT MY HOME AND MY FAMILY WAS BASICALLY SECURE , THAT WE WOULD N'T HAVE THE KIND OF PROBLEMS THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE HAD . AND I THINK WE PROBABLY NEGLECTED THE NEEDS OF OUR OWN CHILDREN . INTERVIEWER : AND YET YOU REACHED A LOT OF OTHER KIDS . WELL , I DO N'T KNOW . I FIND IT PRETTY DIFFICULT TO FIND HOW I CAN REACH OTHER KIDS IF I CA N'T REACH MY OWN . NARRATOR : JACKIE JR . WAS EVENTUALLY COMMITTED TO DAYTOP , A RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION CENTER STAFFED BY EX-ADDICTS IN SEYMOUR , CONNECTICUT .  ON APRIL 4 , 1968 , MARTIN LUTHER KING JR . , WAS ASSASSINATED IN MEMPHIS . JACKIE FLEW OUT IMMEDIATELY BUT ARRIVED TOO LATE . " I CA N'T IMAGINE WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN TO US THIS YEAR , " HE WROTE A FRIEND . " I PRAY WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF TROUBLE FOR A WHILE . " THEN IN JUNE AFTER FEELING PAIN IN HIS CHEST , JACKIE WENT TO SEE HIS DOCTOR . TESTS SHOWED THAT HE HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK . BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY , HE WAS BACK WRITING COLUMNS , DENOUNCING RICHARD NIXON , WHO WAS AGAIN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT , AND RAILING AGAINST INEQUALITY . JACKIE : WELL , I THINK MOST WHITE AMERICANS HAVE THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND IN TERMS OF RACE RELATIONS . WHITE AMERICA IS SAYING , " LAW AND ORDER . YOU GOT TO ABIDE BY IT , " BUT IN THEIR HEARTS , LAW AND ORDER MEANS SIMPLY HOLDING THE BLACK MAN DOWN . NARRATOR : EIGHT YEARS EARLIER , HE HAD BEEN A PROMINENT SUPPORTER OF RICHARD NIXON . JACKIE : I 'M NOT ASKING MR . RACHEL ROBINSON : WHAT HE BECAME VERY DISTURBED ABOUT WAS THAT AMERICA DID N'T MOVE FORWARD . SO HE DID N'T PUT IT ON THE MILITANTS , HE DID N'T PUT IT ON THE RHETORIC . HE PUT IT ON AMERICA 'S UNWILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS . AND AT ONE TIME , HE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING HARD FOR HIM TO SALUTE THE FLAG . I MEAN , I WAS REALLY UPSET BY HIS EVEN THINKING THAT . HE WAS DISAPPEARING , AND CHANGE WAS NOT ON THE FOREFRONT . EDELMAN : JACK AND I WENT TO YOUNGSTOWN , OHIO , ONCE . WE GOT OFF THE PLANE . AND THERE WERE , I THINK , 250 OR 300 PEOPLE IN THE SMALL WAITING ROOM THERE . AND I ACTUALLY DID N'T KNOW WHY . AND AS WE WALKED IN , THIS WOMAN BROUGHT HER YOUNG GRANDSON TO INTRODUCE HIM . " NARRATOR : IN THE FALL OF 1969 , RACHEL TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM HER JOB TO BE MORE AVAILABLE FOR JACKIE , WHOSE DIABETES WAS GETTING WORSE . DAVID HAD BEEN ACCEPTED AT STANFORD . SHARON WAS STUDYING NURSING AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON , D.C . AND JACKIE JR . SEEMED TO BE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER . HE HAD BEEN VISITING CASCADE ROAD REGULARLY . IN MAY OF 1970 , JACKIE AND RACHEL HELD A PICNIC ON THEIR LAWN FOR NEARLY 50 OF JACKIE JUNIOR 'S FRIENDS AND COUNSELORS FROM THE DAYTOP COMMUNITY . SHARON ROBINSON : MY BROTHER IS SOBER . AND , YOU KNOW , HE AND MY FATHER ARE ... ARE BEGINNING TO COMMUNICATE AGAIN . JUST FINALLY WE 'RE SEEING RAYS OF HOPE . NARRATOR : " THAT SINGLE MOMENT PAID FOR " " EVERY BIT OF ANGUISH I HAD EVER UNDERGONE , " WROTE JACKIE . " I HAD MY SON BACK . " THAT FALL , JACKIE JR . MARKED THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF HIS TREATMENT AT DAYTOP . SOON , HE WAS WORKING FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND MAKING HIS OWN PUBLIC APPEARANCES , SPEAKING ABOUT THE RAVAGES OF ADDICTION .  NARRATOR : EARLY ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 17 , 1971 , THE DOORBELL RANG AT CASCADE ROAD . SHARON ROBINSON : IT WAS THE POLICE . AND THEY JUST SAID , " WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS ? " AND I SAID , " WELL , MY MOM 'S AWAY . MY DAD ... " AND I WENT TO GET MY DAD , AND MY DAD DID N'T EVEN COME DOWN TO THE ... DID N'T EVEN COME DOWN THE STEPS . HE STOOD RIGHT AT THE ... AND THE POLICE SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND MY FATHER SAID , YOU KNOW , " HE 'S DEAD . " NARRATOR : WHILE DRIVING ON THE MERRITT PARKWAY IN CONNECTICUT , JACKIE JR . HAD LOST CONTROL OF HIS CAR AND SMASHED THROUGH THE GUARDRAIL . REPORTER : THE CAR SKIDDED ABOUT 30 YARDS BEFORE SLAMMING INTO AN ABUTMENT . POLICE SAY THERE WAS NO INDICATION DRUGS WERE INVOLVED . NARRATOR : JACKIE SENT DAVID TO THE MORGUE TO IDENTIFY THE BODY . THEN HE AND SHARON RUSHED TO HOLYOKE , MASSACHUSETTS , WHERE RACHEL WAS ATTENDING A CONFERENCE . SHARON ROBINSON : UH , MY FATHER AND I , UH , WENT UP TO HER ROOM . WE DID N'T CALL HER AHEAD OF TIME . WE JUST WENT THERE . AND IT 'S EARLY MORNING . SO WE KNOCK ON THE DOOR . AND SHE SAYS , " WHO IS IT ? " AND HE SAID ... YOU KNOW , MY DAD SAYS , " IT 'S UH , IT 'S ... IT 'S SHARON AND I . " AND SHE OPENS THE DOOR . " RACHEL ROBINSON : AND I JUST WENT BERSERK . I JUST COULD N'T BELIEVE THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WAS IMPROVING AND MOVING BACK INTO LIFE AND THEN HE WAS SUDDENLY TAKEN . SO IT WAS MORE THAN A TRAGEDY . IT WAS A PART OF MY LIFE THAT I NEVER GOT OVER . JACK WAS DEVASTATED , DEVASTATED . HE BEGAN TO SAY , " WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE ? " NARRATOR : JACKIE 'S HEALTH CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE . HE HAD LOST SIGHT IN HIS RIGHT EYE , AND HIS LEFT HAD BEGUN TO FAIL AS WELL . ONE DETROIT WOMAN SENT A TELEGRAM TO JACKIE . " DO YOU THINK A TRANSPLANT WILL HELP ? I WILL BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU ONE OF MINE . " THE CIRCULATION IN HIS LEGS WAS SO POUR THAT HIS DOCTOR WARNED THEY WOULD SOON NEED TO BE AMPUTATED . IN APRIL OF 1972 AT THE FUNERAL FOR FORMER DODGER GIL HODGES , ROBINSON 'S TEAMMATES WERE STARTLED BY HIS FRAIL APPEARANCE . EVER SINCE HIS RETIREMENT IN 1956 , HE HAD STAYED AWAY FROM MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL . IT ANGERED HIM THAT NO CLUB HAD YET HIRED A BLACK MANAGER OR EXECUTIVE , AND HE STILL RESENTED THE WAY THINGS HAD ENDED WITH THE DODGERS . BUT 25 YEARS AFTER ROBINSON BROKE THE COLOR LINE IN BASEBALL , HIS OLD TEAMMATE , JOE BLACK , PRESSURED COMMISSIONER BOWIE KUHN INTO INVITING ROBINSON TO THROW OUT A FIRST PITCH AT THE 1972 WORLD SERIES . JACKIE AGREED TO COME , BUT WARNED THE COMMISSIONER THAT HE WOULD USE THE MOMENT TO SPEAK HIS MIND . ON OCTOBER 15 , 1972 , MORE THAN 60 MILLION AMERICANS WATCHED AS JACKIE ROBINSON THREW OUT THE FIRST PITCH BEFORE GAME TWO .  I 'M EXTREMELY PROUD AND PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON , BUT MUST ADMIT I 'M GON NA BE TREMENDOUSLY MORE PLEASED AND MORE PROUD WHEN I LOOK AT THAT THIRD-BASE COACHING LINE ONE DAY AND SEE A BLACK FACE MANAGING IN BASEBALL . THANK YOU VERY MUCH . RACHEL ROBINSON : I DRESSED AND WENT TO THE KITCHEN TO MAKE BREAKFAST . AND I COULD SEE HIM COMING . I WAS STANDING IN THE KITCHEN . I COULD SEE HIM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY NAKED . HE HAD N'T DRESSED , AND HE WAS RUNNING . AND SO I RAN OUT OF THE KITCHEN , AH , TO MEET HIM BECAUSE I KNEW SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG . AND , UM , HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME , AND HE SAID , " I LOVE YOU . " AND HE JUST SANK TO THE FLOOR . NARRATOR : JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON DIED AT 7:10 A.M . HE WAS JUST 53 YEARS OLD . THE OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH WAS A HEART ATTACK . MORE THAN 500 MOURNERS AN HOUR STREAMED PAST HIS COFFIN TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS . ON OCTOBER 29 , 2,500 PEOPLE CROWDED INTO RIVERSIDE CHURCH IN HARLEM . JESSE JACKSON : JACKIE AS A FIGURE IN HISTORY WAS A ROCK IN THE WATER , CREATING CONCENTRIC CIRCLES AND RIPPLES OF NEW POSSIBILITY . " IN HIS LAST DASH , JACKIE STOLE HOME . " PAIN , MISERY , AND TRAVAIL HAVE LOST . " NO GRAVE CAN HOLD THIS BODY DOWN . IT BELONGS TO THE AGES . " RACHEL ROBINSON : I THINK THE THING I MISS THE MOST IS HAVING A TRUSTED FRIEND THAT I CAN TALK TO ANYTIME ABOUT ANYTHING . I CHERISHED THAT BECAUSE WE HAD TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER . AND THE SECOND THING I MISS IS HAVING HIS ARMS AROUND ME . HE WAS VERY , VERY , UM ... EXPRESSIVE AND , UH , LOVING . AND I MISS THAT . I MISS THAT A LOT . BARACK OBAMA : THE EMPATHY OF WATCHING BALL GAMES AND SEEING JACKIE ROBINSON PERFORM WITH SPEED AND POWER BUT ALSO WITH DIGNITY AND GRACE , THAT CHANGED HOW AMERICA THOUGHT ABOUT RACE RELATIONS . SPORTS IS POWERFUL . ON THE ONE HAND , IT 'S A GAME . ON THE OTHER HAND , IT IS A UNIFYING PART OF OUR CULTURE . IT SAID TO ALL OF US WE WILL NEVER ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY WERE . MAN : " I WAS THE BLACK GRANDSON OF A SLAVE , " " THE SON OF A BLACK SHARECROPPER , " " PART OF A HISTORIC OCCASION , " " A SYMBOLIC HERO TO MY PEOPLE ... " " BUT I KNOW THAT I AM A BLACK MAN IN A WHITE WORLD . " " IN 1972 , IN 1947 , " " AT MY BIRTH IN 1919 , " " I KNOW THAT I NEVER HAD IT MADE . " JACKIE ROBINSON .A . WITH QUIET DIGNITY AND STEADFAST CONVICTION , JACKIE SHOWED THE WORLD WHAT COURAGE , DETERMINATION , AND PRIDE , REGARDLESS OF COLOR , COULD ACCOMPLISH . BANK OF AMERICA IS PROUD TO CELEBRATE JACKIE 'S LEGACY AND FOLLOW IN HIS COMMITMENT TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND RESPECT FOR ALL AMERICANS .

@@5241441 Previously on " Justified " ... Just got transferred from the Harlan lockup . I 'm Gretchen Swift . Ava : Ohh ! You know , there 's a rumor going around that a federal lawman was instrumental in the death of Nicky Augustine . Art : No shit . Raylan : It was n't Barkley . And I can tell you that for a fact . Raylan :  Kendal : Could n't wait to see me again , huh ? Wendy : Let Ms . Brander do her job . Kendal : Talking to me is her job . Who else 's wellness is she here to check on ? Wendy : How long have you been going with that marshal ? I have an eye for that sort of thing .  Danny :    Girl give you my message ?  Boyd 's got another shipment coming in . He 's striking up a connection with the Mexicans . Well , shit . Boyd : I come in peace . Darryl : What you want ? Boyd : I 've got a job that needs doing . Darryl : Gon na make some money . You in charge while we gone . You up to it , right , little man ? Danny : ' Course he 's up to it . He 's a man now , ai n't he ? Look after Chelsea while I 'm gone . Darryl : You all right ? Seem a little off the last few days . Kendal : No , I 'm good . I 'll take care of everything . Darryl : All right . Let me know .  Five minutes left . Ava : I know . See , I know my guy ai n't coming . In the beginning , they visit all the time . Then there 's work emergencies , sick relatives . Last week , my guy had a " flat tire . " That 's why you ought to rely on the heavenly mother . She does n't ever forget about you , leave you waiting . Ava : I 'm not interested in religion , Penny . Darryl : Hey , do n't be shushing at me , man . Is you crazy ? Boyd : Talk as loud as you want . Johnny ai n't here . He 's probably crossing the border as we speak . Shit . What do you want to do ? Boyd : I 'm gon na do what I was always gon na do . I 'm gon na book a one-way ticket to Mexico and bring back my 25 kilos of heroin . So what about them . On this lonely road ? trying to make it home ? doing it by my lonesome ? pissed off , who wants some . I 'm fighting for my soul ? God get at your boy ? you try to bogard ? fall back , I go hard ? on this lonely road ? trying to make it home ? doing it by my lonesome ? pissed off , who wants some . I see them long , hard times to come ? Raylan :  Hey , Raylan . You sure ? They make these tasty little breakfast sandwiches . Raylan : Stick with coffee , thanks . Suit yourself . Which one of you do I talk to about my money ? Like reward money ? Deputy Givens handles walk-ins . Raylan : What 's that ? As per the chief . Excuse me , sir ? Raylan : Can you just hold up a sec ? 7:00 in the morning . Sorry . I thought you knew . Art 's got you handling walk-ins now . That 's why you 're coming in so early . I really thought he told you . Raylan : It 's all right . I 'm good . Have a seat , mister , uh ... Salmeron . Larry Salmeron . Raylan : So ... Reward money . Backgammon money . Raylan : Backgammon money . Nearly $250,000 you people took from me . Raylan : Backgammon money . Have you heard of falafel , marshal ? Raylan : Never cared much for it . Always found it kind of like a cut-rate hush puppy . Mr . Now , I believe I rival Mr . Falafel in my online backgammon winnings ... winnings which you and your colleagues took when you shut down my website of choice . Raylan :  Ca n't say I recall having seized a website recently . You people arrested Charles Monroe , did you not ? Seized his assets ... Raylan : Hold up . Monroe ? How 's Charles Monroe connect to this ? He 's the one that owned the site . Am I making sense to you yet , marshal ? Are you connecting the dots ? Raylan : What 's the website ? K-y-backgammon . Kentucky owned and operated . And Monroe had a local I.T . - Genius working for ... Raylan : Well ... There you are . Yes , as I said , you 've seized the site and taken my money . Raylan : No , see ... There 's two I 's in " Marshall . Well ... Impersonating a federal agency is a crime . Probably an FBI thing . Tell you what ... or you could just leave . Rachel : So you just let him walk out ? Raylan : Should have chased him down , I guess . Maybe winged him in the leg , give us a blood trail to track him by . Rachel : Money in that site belongs to the marshals service . Been nice if you could have brought him in for a word . Raylan : Considering I found out I was covering walk-ins from Nelson while in the middle of a walk-in , I think I comported myself admirably . Rachel : Tim , did you not tell Raylan he was on walk-ins ? Tim : Raylan , you 're on walk-ins . Rachel :  Per the chief .  Tim : So , Monroe has this genius , T.J . , who apparently lacks the wherewithal to run a spell-check , operating the site for him . T.C . Tim : T.C . , T. Raylan : So my walk-in was n't entirely full of shit . I 'll run him down , see if I can get more details . Rachel : Unh-unh . You already rubbed him the wrong way once . Better you go after this T.C . Guy and get his story . Raylan : You sure you can trust me with that ? I mean , what happens if there 's another walk-in ? Rachel : Well , given your track record so far , I ca n't imagine we 'll fare too much worse . Tim : Does this mean it 's me and the backgammon dude ? I 'm just saying I 'm more of a cribbage guy , is all . Rachel : Get it done . Tim : Yes , ma'am .  You gon na pay attention ? Feel like I 'm playing against myself here . Do n't need to . I 'm playing a girl .   Shit ! Careful ! That 's a pro series ! It 's worth more than you are !  What the hell ? Oh , new client . Get the door . Do n't you got enough going on already ? Well , they said it 's an emergency , and they 're paying through the nose . Now get the damn door .   Hey , there . T.C . In ? Damn it , Candace . come on in . You Kemp ? Yeah . She do the website making with you ? No , I do the programming . She makes the sandwiches . Now , what can I help you with ? Denial of service attack ? Denial of what ? I-I ... you better speak to Larry . I do n't speak nerd . Are you the Mr . Fleming that ran K-Y-Backgammon for Charles Monroe ? Looky here ... he 's going for a taser . Can you believe that ?  I will aim to use words of one syllable , the word " syllable " not withstanding . Federal government did that , man . But they did n't . Now , my friend here specializes in making people pay their debts . I learned that the hard way three years ago . So , my advice is pay up now before , as you and your cohorts might say , " shit gets hairy up in here . " Like I said , the feds took it . " Thug life , " huh ?   Now , this ... Will probably take that arm clean off .  He ... he took it . He took the money . God damn it , Candace . She 's the smart one . Money 's all just ones and zeroes right now , okay ? Look , it ai n't like I just got it laying around here . Now , you guys do what you want , but you start beating on us , you ai n't never gon na see a dollar of that cash . All right . They will get me my $250,000 while you get anally raped in prison . $250,000 ? You only gon na pay me $5,000 ? A deal is a deal , Mr . Kemp . Remember , I 've got you on tape threatening that girl a minute ago . Aah !   Quarter mil , huh ? We 're asking your forgiveness that , in our misery , we have desecrated ourselves with booze or drugs or violence or men , looking for something that was right here all the time . O heavenly mother , our mama , you hear us when we say it ... - Amen ! - All : Amen ! Amen .  - You got any cigarettes ? - Ava : If I had any , I 'd be smoking ' em . I 'm Ava . I know who you are . Penny 's been trying to witness since you got here . You would n't give her the time of day . Ava : Never really had any use for religion . ' Course not . - Ava : But I ai n't out there - anymore . - No .  Missy , you are not . Ava : I 've been listening to you talk . There 's a lot of sense in it . You think I do n't know why you 're all of a sudden batting your eyes at me ? You want protection , sanctuary . Keep these bitches from stomping you and cutting you and  worse . Ava : So what if I do ? At least you 're honest . What I preach in here , what I say in my prayers , I mean . You do n't really seem to me like you 're ready to hear about that just yet . Ava : I am willing to ... no , no , no , that 's okay . I get it .  But this ai n't the ' 70s , when the moonies and Jesus freaks got a pass . The reason we do n't get jacked with is ... That 's why they leave us alone . You up for that ? Ava : What do I have to do ? Got some coming in today . Penny 'll show you . Ava : I got to think it 's dangerous . Only reason you offering me the job . It 's got its downside . Like I said , Penny 'll show you the ropes . Or you can go back to staring at a door , waiting on a man to save you . Somebody get me a cigarette . Johnny : You get anything on Hot Rod 's bank account ? Nah , the old-timer 's still claiming we already got it all . Johnny : Yeah , well , he 's lying out his ass , no doubt . I 'll be back tomorrow , and we 'll get him talking . So , how 's Mexico ? All the se ? oritas and tacos and shit ? Johnny : It 's dirty . Hey , what 's up , man ? You got something you need to tell Crowder ? I 'm driving . Johnny : Jay ? What you mean you driving ? You get me carsick . Johnny : Jay , I got to go . Where 's Mr . Crowder ? Johnny : Well , I 'm - Mr . Crowder ... a different Mr . Crowder . Boyd sent you ? Johnny : Actually , I 'm here to outbid Boyd . I have something I 'd like to discuss with Mr . Yoon personally . You think you can arrange that ? You have the cash on you ? Johnny : First I see Mr . Yoon , and then you see the cash . All right . Get in . Unh-unh-unh . Just you . The price of admission . Alison : Ms . Crowe ? Wendy : Hi ... What kind of things get his motor ... Going , you know ? Alison : Are you joking right now ? ' Cause if you 're not , I-I got to say , you sound like you just stepped out of a bad country song , " I 've got to come take my man . " Wendy : Funny thing , though . Those are the songs that just get stuck in your head ... " ear worms , " I think is what they call them . Alison : Okay , so you 're serious , then ? Well , let me tell you ... I do n't foresee you learning anything more intimate about Raylan than you already have . Sorry you wasted your time coming all the way up from Harlan just to give me shit . Wendy : Oh , I did n't come up here to talk to you , Alison . I-I came to talk to your boss . Apologies for the precautions . Mr . Boyd : No apologies necessary , Alberto . After all , a man 's home is his castle . We 'll return your firearm once we have conducted our business . Boyd : And here I thought we were all friends . That 's what we thought . He 'll be with you shortly . Boyd : Well , look at you . Even vultures can fly South for the winter . Johnny : How was Memphis ? Boyd : Well , I 'm afraid we were n't there long enough to enjoy it . Johnny : You want to tell me just how it was Hot Rod tipped you off ? Boyd : Some questions do n't get answered till the afterlife . Good news is , you 'll find out soon enough . Johnny :  How much money you got in that bag , Boyd ? $700,000 ? $800,000 ?  I am not the one in trouble here . In all my years of doing business , this is a first . Now , if you will give me five minutes alone with this piece of shit , I will eliminate this bump in our road and get us back on easy street . Your cousin here claims he has vast resources at his disposal ... to the tune of almost $40,000 a kilo . Boyd : Why , cousin Johnny , I do n't see a briefcase anywhere . You got $1 million shoved up your ass ? He says he can have it here with a simple phone call . Boyd : Mr . Yoon , if I hear a deal is too good to be true , more often than not , it 's too good to be true . Johnny : It 's not just the heroin , Boyd . No , I 'm spending my money on something else . Boyd : Oh , yeah ? What , is he gon na give you a reach-around ?  Johnny : I 'm buying your life . Boyd : Mr ... so do the rednecks in Kentucky . Well , I 'm willing to take that risk . But until that briefcase arrives , I wo n't be taking any . Now , if his money is good , I 'm going with him . If he ca n't deliver , then I 'll take yours . How long is this liable to take ? The money 's in Bitcoins . I was moving it around online , you know ? Covering the trail . That is not an answer , dot-com .  Six hours , maybe eight , before I can turn it into cash . Why ? ' Cause there 's something looks like a cop just pulled up outside . You any ideas ? Maybe your pal 's call got through . Maybe you ought to go . All right , thanks for the tip . Come on . Get up . Get up !  Now , you get rid of that cop , and you call me when you got the money . That 's being generous .  Go on . Raylan :  How y'all doing ? What 's that ? Raylan : Just said , " how you doing ? " I know you ? Raylan : I 'm deputy U.S . marshal Raylan Givens . Well , I 'm Dr . Richard Kimble . Raylan :  So , you 're all doing okay , then ? Yeah . We 're ... we 're just running a little late , so if you do n't mind ... Raylan : Have a good one . Yeah , you , too . Keep doing the lord 's work .  Raylan : T.C . Fleming ? Yeah ? Raylan : Deputy U.S . marshal Raylan Givens . I want to ask you a few questions . Yeah , I 'm real busy . Raylan : You did n't ask about what . How about I just come down to your office tomorrow ? Raylan : How about I come in now ... Raylan : Seem a bit jumpy . Got anything to do with that asshole I just ran into downstairs ? Work emergency . About to become a civil-rights emergency , you just coming in here uninvited . You want to do a body-cavity search while you 're at it ? Raylan : I want to ask you about the website you ran for Charles Monroe . But now I 'm thinking maybe you ought to come with me . Hey !  Holy shit ! Wow . Well , shit . Tim : Wait a minute . How many legs this guy have , again ? Raylan : Just the one . Plus the prosthetic he took with . Tim : When he jumped out the window , thus escaping the scene of a murder . Raylan : He was surprisingly fleet . Tim : Huh . Rachel : What about the guy from the stairs ? Raylan : What about him ? Rachel : You think he was involved ? Raylan : Sure . Raylan : How is it art 's not in here giving me shit on this ? Hard for me to fathom his passing the opportunity . Shutdown notice is n't on the site anymore . Fleming replaced it with a link to his blog ... a big , bold post about how he just made this marshal his bitch . Raylan : I 'll find him . Rachel : No . Tim and I 'll go after Hopalong . You see if you can run down the asshole from the stairwell . Raylan : Guy threw his leg out the window , jumped out , and then slid down a light pole , and then gave me the bird . Come on . I love this guy . Let me catch him . Rachel : Not this time , Raylan . Raylan : Is this " per the chief " ? Rachel : What do you think ? Tim : Catch up with your boy , we 'll give you a call before we bust down the door ... Chris , right ? Yeah . Raylan : Is there any way to put a reply on T.C . 's blog ? God , no . Technology to reply to a post is decades away .  Raylan : Hello , Alison . Suspended ? Why ? Wendy Crowe ? Thought they 'd be gone by now . Boyd : So , you really got all that money ? Johnny : You best believe it . Boyd : Well , I guess old hot rod must be in quite a state . Johnny : Hmm . He 's seen better days . That 's it ? That 's all you got to say ? Not gon na use that silver tongue of yours , try and talk your way out of this ? Boyd : A wise man once said , " what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun . " Life we chose only ends one way . I been at peace with that for a very long time now .  Boyd : Well , I remember when you used to bring me a six-pack of beer . Things were n't always this ugly between us , Johnny . Johnny : I guess we remember things different . Boyd : Well , what about Jenna Wright ? Huh ? I remember you crushing on her pretty hard in high school , and I went out of my way to set that up . Johnny :  Yeah , you did . And then you slept with her . Boyd : Huh . Well , it was n't my fault you could only get to first base . Johnny : You only gave me two weeks . Boyd : Well , like I said , it was n't my fault you could only get to first base . Johnny : Well , then , I will be sure to wait two weeks before I play ball with your beautiful fianc ? e . Boyd : Well , I guess there 's something to be said for keeping it in the family . Johnny : I understand . I can not stress that last part enough . Dead Americans in Mexico creates a problem for us .  I 'm sorry things did not work out . Boyd : Not as sorry as I am . Alison : Woman looked up every court case my name appeared in , mapping out a " pattern of misconduct . " And then she pulled out some chickenshit pot arrest from five years back ... got overturned . Then there 's you . Raylan : Me ? Alison : It does n't look good , you and me , especially after you went down there and punched Danny Crowe in the face . Raylan : That was Rachel . That was not me . Alison : Well , then you should call my boss and let her know . I 'm sure that 'll make all the difference . Raylan : Two weeks , huh ? Alison : Yeah . Raylan : Gives me plenty of time to make it up to you . Alison : Sure . Excuse me . Would you close us out ? Sure . Alison : Thank you . I 'm seeing some friends . Want to try and cheer me up . Raylan : How about I just come over with a bottle of blanton 's and cheer you up the old-fashioned way ? What ? Alison : She said she was gon na alienate your affection by working her feminine wiles . Raylan : I 'd like to see her try . Alison :  Meaning she does n't have a hope in hell or you would like to see her try ? Raylan : Not my type . Alison : Criminal family , tramp stamp ... I thought that was exactly your type . Raylan : Tramp stamp ? Alison :  Uh , Mr . Givens , I 'm sorry , but your card was declined . Raylan : Oh , that 's odd . Uh , the message on the screen said to destroy it . I 'm afraid I 'm still gon na have to destroy it . Raylan : Yet you brought it back to the table anyway ? And I still need payment for the drinks . Alison : Here . Thank you . Raylan : I 'll pay you back . Alison : Mm-hmm . Raylan : So ...  Alison : You should probably get that . It might be the credit-card company or ... Someone with a tramp stamp you never noticed . Raylan : Givens . You having trouble with your card at the ... Midnight Star saloon , deputy dipshit ? Raylan : How 's it going , T.C . ? How 's life as a fugitive ? I just hope you 're on a date . How 's it feel ... look like a chump twice in one day ? Raylan : How 'd you get my number ? Man , I 've been phone phreaking since I was 14 . Now , you want that money back , you stop screwing up my life . It ai n't like you 're ever gon na catch me , anyway . Raylan : Are you kidding ? We got a special squad for chasing guys like you . Deputies all missing limbs ... make it fair . Yeah , you 're giving up already , though , huh ? At that bar , having a beer . Ooh , several beers . You an alcoholic , deputy ? Raylan : I told you I was gon na get you tomorrow . I 'll make it tonight if you 'd like . Well , come and get me . Tim : Phone call you received was made over the Internet , and apparently the guy 's using Wi-Fi from the hotel he 's at . Raylan : Kind of stupid of him , ai n't it ? Tim : The guy 's got skill enough to empty your bank account at will . Raylan : Tell them not to do shit until I get there . Told T.C . I was gon na get him tonight . It 's gon na be me coming through that door . Kendal : Hey , Wendy . Wendy : Hey , what 's up ? Kendal : I need to talk to you about something . Wendy : Look , I know I just got back , but it turns out I have to make a u-turn , head back up to Lexington , and fast . Is it important ? Kendal : No . Wendy : All right . We 'll talk later . Kendal : Get your damn hands off that bottle . There was n't nobody here . What am I ' posed to do ? Kendal : Man , go get a hand job or something . I 'll get you in a minute .   Yeah ? Kendal : Hey , Uncle Jack ? It 's Kendal . How are you , kiddo ? Kendal : I 'm good ... I guess . I was wondering where you were living now . Anywhere near Kentucky ? Showerruns , stops This is Ava . She 's gon na be taking over for me , starting next week . Wow ! Milam met you yet ? What am I , dog shit ?  No , Penny . No , you 're just ... you know , meeting someone new . Ava : It 's a pleasure to meet you , Rhyner . And so professional . Hey , Rhynes . You did n't have to do that .  Yeah , I know . You 're , uh ... you 're Ava Crowder , right ? Ava : Yep . Yeah , I been seeing you around . Looking forward to working with you .  All right , Penny , guess this is that farewell lap . You can go ahead and take the stuff to Judith . I 'll be right behind you . He does n't take long . Ava : Hey . It 's real big , but you 'll get used to it . All right . Here you go , Ava . You sure you ca n't , uh , stay for a little bit ? Ava : Yeah . I got to run . All right , then .   Too bad you had to make the trip out to ... I never been on a sailboat . Uh , motorboats , uh , rowboats , sure , no problem . But I figured , " hey , how hard could it be ? " How about you ? You ... you like the ocean ? No , I think it 's lame . ' Cause you 've never been . I was born in Virginia beach . Yeah . Maybe we ought to swing by there and see your parents . You can introduce them to your new boyfriend . He got all his parts .  Speak of the devil . Tim : U.S . marshals ! Well , he ai n't here . Raylan : Shit . He 's the only reason I came . Tim : Yeah . Yeah . - Yeah , I heard you the first time . - Okay . You ever notice Chris is kind of a dick ? All right . Well , he says T.C . Fleming hacked the phone system , made it look like the call came from here . He could be anywhere . Raylan : Told me he was " phone phreaking " since he was 14 . Tim : Sounds like a real winner . Raylan : He do that to your arm , or are you gon na tell me the big , ugly guy there did it ? Do n't hear me complaining . Tim : You ai n't tired of getting knocked around ?  Shit , no . I give as good as I get . But I will tell you where he is . See , time to time , I do coding for T.C . , proof his html .C . Tells him I make the sandwiches . Mm-hmm . That 's when I decided he was an asshole .     God damn it . Grandma , I told you ! Raylan : Surprised you picked a basement to hide out in . Got no window to jump out of .  That bitch . Tim : Well , if you 're talking about grandma , she 's actually kind of a hard-ass . Told us she had n't seen you in weeks . Raylan : It was Candace that gave you up . Let 's go . Up you go . No , no , no . We 're gon na hold on to that . This could be used as a weapon .  I ca n't believe she gave me up . I did send y'all to her rescue . Raylan : Said you disrespected her computer skills . What skills ? She 's a shitty coder . Raylan : How 'd you lose your leg ? Cancer when I was 14 . I just take you to jail . Man , I should have just run off with that money as soon as I had it . Raylan : You already went on a shopping spree , judging by your place . What , you mean all the tvs and shit ? Raylan : Uh-huh . No , I won all that stuff , man . Raylan : " Price is right " ? I 'm caller number seven . Raylan : What ? You know , radio stations that give shit away , and they 're like , " caller number seven wins a TV " or " caller nine gets a car . " Well , I 'm always caller number seven . Raylan : The " phone phreaking " thing , huh ? Hey , you know , I 'm gon na get you all your money back . I 'm gon na fix all your credit cards as soon as they let me get to a computer . Hey , what if I teach you how to be caller number seven ? Raylan : Money 's in the evidence locker , and they 're looking at that guy Kemp for the murder . Rachel : Great .  Art wanted me to tell you ... uh , that thing with Darryl Crowe 's parole is n't gon na happen . The sister complained to the judge down in Florida . Judge reiterated that Darryl 's legally free to move as he pleases . Art : Do n't feel like you have to knock or anything . Raylan : You want me to go back out and knock ? Art : No , you 're here now . Did you get your guy ? Raylan : You know I got my guy . Art : Well , good . I guess we 're done , then . Nice talking to you . Raylan : Art ... I do n't need this shit . Put me on walk-ins ? Come on , Art . Art : Raylan , if you do n't like the way I 'm running things , you can always quit . Raylan : Bullshit . I ai n't gon na quit . Art : Well ... Raylan : You 're gon na get back to treating me like a deputy . Art :  Raylan : Or transfer me . Art : Okay . I 'll call Dan tomorrow , see if he 's got a spot for you . Raylan : Oh , I did n't mean Florida . I meant anywhere ... anywhere that gets me out of this bullshit . Art :   Raylan : Sooner the better . Art : Okay . Raylan : I got some vacation time . Starting tomorrow , I 'm gon na go down to Florida , see my kid . When I get back ... One or the other . Art : Going to see your kid , huh ? Raylan : Mm-hmm . Art : Going on your own dime this time ? Raylan : No , chief . I won it on a radio contest . Art :   Plumber got caught with drugs on his way out . Ava : Shit . " Shit " is right . Keep it to yourself . Once word gets out , girls find the heroin 's dried up , might get ugly . Ava : What if I can keep it from drying up ? That change the equation at all ? You saying you can get heroin ? Ava : That 's what I 'm saying . Look here . Girl bit me , took out a chunk . I knocked four of her teeth out after that . Got this one from an Aryan . Toothbrush shiv . I 'm too old to live this life again , and you sure as hell ai n't cut out for it . Ava : I got a few scars of my own . You say you can get the dope ... You better be right . Just remember , the hardest part ai n't getting the drugs . It 's getting them inside . And maybe it 's a coincidence ... Rhyner gets busted the day I introduce the two of you . I hope to God almighty you did n't risk all our lives to keep from having to screw a guard . You really can get the dope ... I might have a way to get it in . Ava :  Raylan : Are n't you tired of cleaning up Darryl 's messes ? Wendy : Well , we 're family . Raylan : I 've been thinking family loyalty probably do n't go so far with you Crowes . Wendy : Just like how you 're down in Florida with your little girl right now , you mean ? Raylan : Know I 've got a kid , huh ? Wendy : Yeah . I 've looked into you . Raylan : And I 've looked into you , too . You 've been registered at some third-tier law school since the early part of this century , never quite able to complete . I 'm assuming that 's ' cause Darryl keeps dragging you back into his shit . Wendy : Wow . I have to admit ... I find your blatant abuse of government privilege incredibly sexy . Raylan :  Wendy :  Raylan : Help me get Darryl . He 's in jail , means he 's not in Miami , messing up your life . You can finally finish law school . Wendy : Mm . Hell , Darryl knows that better than anyone ... why he killed Dilly . Wendy : He what , now ? Raylan : Well , what 'd Darryl tell you ? He 's living in a nice home at some farm somewhere ? Anyway ... Wendy : What , so that 's your offer , huh ? Raylan : That 's my offer . Wendy : Now , is that your final offer , or would you like to keep negotiating ? Raylan :  Wendy : ' Cause I 've got a table and two chairs up in my room ... booze , too , if you need it . Raylan : You do n't have to decide right away . Take a week or two . Think about it . Oh , and could you get the tab ? Having trouble with my card .  Johnny : Here we go ! Hey , big " D . " You boys want to do the honors ? I can show my cousin what he lost . Get ' em ! Get your head down ! Do n't you look at me ! Get down ! Get down ! Do n't look up ! Johnny : God damn . You was in on this the whole time . Boyd : Well , it turns out some people still give a shit about what kind of person they do business with . Johnny : Why did n't you just kill me ? Boyd : Because we wanted to make sure we had your money , and like the man said , no bodies drop in Mexico . Johnny :  Boyd : Now , the rest of you are welcome to go back to our original agreement . You get this product back in the U.S . You go back to working for Hot Rod . How does that sound right about now ? I think we 're good with that . Johnny : I 'm guessing that do n't apply to me . Boyd : No , cousin , it does not ... just not this desert . Now put this piece of shit in the back of that truck . Yep . Danny : Do n't do it ! Boyd : No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! What the hell are you doing ? ! Danny : He pulled on me ! Darryl : Why did you do that ? ! Danny : I did n't have a choice ! Johnny :  Good luck getting that shit out of Mexico . Boyd :   Danny : Boyd , I did n't have a choice . Boyd : Do n't you say another goddamn word . Tell Mr . Yoon we have a problem .

She does n't look quite right . - Ootockalocka what ? - It 's the tree . Old Vicky . You 're saying this tree has a name ? And its name is Vicky ? - Yep , she just does n't look right . - And why is that ? Well , look at that knot right there that 's oozing goo . And the branches , too . They look kind of tired . And look right here at the leaves . They should n't be all dry and cracked and crunchy around the edges like that . - Yeah , right . Because it 's Springtime . - Exactly . I think she 's really sick . Calm down , Ed . Her name might be Vicky , but it 's a tree . This is Old Vicky . She 's been around forever . Long before Uncle Anku . Way before One-who-waits .

A leaf ? - One of Old Vicky 's . Ed and Dr . Fleischman were golfing on your back pasture and these leaves were all over the ground . - Is that a fact ? - Had a big sore on her trunk . - And her limbs were all droopy . - No kidding . Let me see that . She does n't look good , Maurice . Not good at all . Well , well . Do n't go calling the toothpick factory yet , - Did I say anything ? - You did n't have to . We all have our life spans , and that old tree has outlived hers thrice over . No thanks to you . - Gents . - Bye , Maurice . Hey . Are those blood samples ready ? I got a couple of petro-geologists to pick up in Wrangell . - Why do n't you just grab a seat ? - All right . I know I said they 'd be ready by two . Fine . I was playing golf this morning , all right ? - Fine . - I do n't see what the big deal is . It 's 2:15 . Will they have a conniption for five minutes ? - I did n't say anything . - Well , obviously you 're thinking it . - No , I wasn't . - If I did n't have golf up here , they 'd be sending me to Bellevue in a straight jacket . - God . You 're such a jerk . - I 'm a jerk ? - Yes , you 're a Jerk with a capital J . - Let me tell you something . You do n't have a clue who I am . You think this is me ? This is n't me . I would n't be here . I 'd be back in New York where I belong . Doing things I want to do with people I want to be doing them with . I would n't be in this stupid , backwater with this stupid practice . Now , that was stupid . I think I broke something . That was a stupid , jerky thing to do , Fleischman , but totally predictable . All right , everybody ! Behinds to seats back there . Now , let 's get this blanket stitched . This meeting has been called by the Cicely steering committee . Re : the old cottonwood out on my back pasture . Now , granted , if you live in a place 300 odd years , you 'll make some friends . But that 's not the point here . The point is that , that tree is on its last legs . I say , the tree is a menace and she 's got to come down . Not so fast , Minnifield . Now , that cottonwood is a state historic landmark . Historic landmark ? You just made that up out of spite . Nice try . We all know why he wants that old tree out of the way . So he can put up some corrugated eyesore to store his tractors in . I do n't care how far away it is . I can see it fine from the roof of my barn . I bet you poisoned Old Vicky , and that 's the reason she 's sick . Why , you little six-toed ferret . Maurice , Ivory , hold your water . We do n't even know if Ootockalockatuvik is dying . That 's a good point , Ruth-Anne . We ought to get a professional before we put ax to wood . All right . If that 's what it 'll take to get you sentimental Sallies off the dime , fine . We 'll get a professional man . Fleischman ? - What ? - Have a look-see at that tree . - Why me ? - Because you 're the town doctor . I 'm the doctor . I do n't know anything about trees . Well , let us decide that . We paid for your education . Let us use it the way we see fit . - Yeah , but , Maurice ... - My house . 0900 .

Go and plant a wet one on a tree . Hey , Dr . Fleischman . - Well , there 's your patient . - Look , let 's get one thing straight . Under no stretch of the imagination is this a patient . We 're dealing with a tree here . Let 's just be clear . - We 're aware of that , Joel . - Look , it 's just a formality . A blind man could see this tree wo n't make it . Zip it , Minnifield . That 's for the kid to decide . Yes , Joel . What do you think ? Is Old Vicky going to make it ? You really want to know what I think ? All right , fine . I 'll tell you what I think . See something , Doc ? I 'm not sure , but right here on the epidermal layer ... Bark , I mean . - Lightning . Summer of ' 82 . - Does anyone know about this cavity ? - Is it congenital or acquired ? - It 's always been there , Joel . Is Ootockalockatuvik dying , Joel ? I really ca n't be sure . Come on , Fleischman , get off the fence . What 's the verdict ? Is Vicky firewood or not ? The thing is , I ca n't make a prognosis here . - Well , why the hell not ? - I do n't know anything about trees . I 'm an internist , not a horticulturist . I 'm sorry , it 's not my specialty . It 's not my fault . I do n't know anything about trees . So , Fleischman throws this doozy of a tantrum . He says he 's a jerk because he 's in Alaska . He 'd be the same stupid jerk on Park Avenue . So , you acted nice and normal to Dr . F . - No ? Why not ? Like the lady with the snake , he 's just like he is and that 's how it 's going to be . On her way to work one morning , down the path alongside the lake , a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake . His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew . " Poor thing , " she cried , " I 'll take you in and I 'll take care of you . " " Take me in , tender woman . Take me in for heaven 's sake . Take me in , tender woman , " sighed the snake . What happened after that ? She wrapped him up all cozy , in a comforter of silk , and laid him by her fireside with honey and some milk . She hurried home from work that night , and as soon as she arrived . Take me in for heaven 's sake . Take me in , tender woman , " sighed the snake . She clutched him to her bosom . " You 're so beautiful , " she cried . " But if I had n't brought you in , by now you might have died . " She stroked his pretty skin again , and kissed and held him tight . Instead of saying thanks , the snake gave her a vicious bite . Take me in , tender woman , " sighed the snake . " I saved you , " cried the woman , " and you 've bitten me . But why ? You know your bite is poisonous and now I 'm going to die . " " Shut up , you silly woman , " said the reptile with a grin . " You knew damn well I was a snake , before you took me in . " " Take me in , tender woman . Take me in for heaven 's sake . Would you like help with that ? - I 'm doing just fine without you . - Okay . Good . Good ! Yeah ? You remember when I was in your office yesterday ... - ... and you had a little snit ? - Please . Leave it alone , all right ? I have a fractured foot . Is that not enough for you ? What I 'm trying to say is , I realize what the problem is , and it 's not you . It 's me . I realize that I had these unrealistic expectations of you . And you 're not doing anything . You 're just being you . - I really appreciate the sentiment . - See , now you 're being sarcastic . But that 's okay . That 's all right . Because that 's you . That 's who you are . I do n't have to take it personally , and I do n't have to be different than who I am . I 'm just a nice , everyday person . And I do n't know how , but I 've got into some very unhealthy patterns . It 's not your fault , I do n't have to react to every little thing . I do n't have to get defensive . I do n't have to get angry . What are you talking about ? I 'm me and you 're you . And even if you 're not nice , I am . Where do you get off , coming into my house , making these pronouncements about who 's nice and who 's not ? I 'm perfectly nice . I am kind . I help people . People who need me . I 'm perfectly nice . I 'm an educated man . I am intelligent , I am funny . So , do n't come in here and tell me who 's nice and who is n't . " Attach stabilizer bar J to crib ends N and J using four machine screws . - Yeah . Hey , read me what comes next on there , will you ? " Attach 8 track with the slotted holes to bottom of the crib ends . " You guys got the munchies , I 'll bring you a snack . - No thanks , Shell . - I 'm not hungry , but if you take requests , I 'd like to hear Tangerine . Tangerine . You 're lucky you get to hear this all the time . I 'll tell you the truth . Anyone can get too much of a good thing . Shelly never stops . She opens her mouth , out comes a song . I ca n't even have a simple conversation with her . Pass the salt . What 's on the grill ? Looks like rain ... Everything becomes a regular opera . - Did you ask her to stop ? - I did . It was as useless as asking a parakeet to stop chirping . She ca n't help herself . She just sings whether she wants to or not . I know it 's selfish of me , but I 'm craving a simple turn of phrase . A sentence without a melody . Someone I can talk with . If Shelly keeps on like this , I do n't know what I 'll do ! My heart belongs to Tangerine . Yes she has them all on the run . " The trees indeed have hearts with a certain affection . The sun seems to send its farewell ray far over the hills to them and they silently receive it with gratitude like a group of settlers with children . The pines impress me as human . A slight vaporous cloud floats high over them while in the west the sun goes down pace behind glowing pines and golden clouds like mountains hurt the horizon . " Nobody could turn a phrase like Thoreau . More from him in a minute . Hey , " jefe " , what 's up ? - Got a proposition for you , Stevens . No lie . End of the month , I 'm scrounging for quarters in the sofa . After Fleischman signs off on old Vicky , I 'll need somebody to take her down . Thought you might like the job . That 's a pretty big job . You might want to get some pros on that . Well , you were n't the first one I thought of to wield the chain-saw , but all the regular lumber crews are busy and I wo n't be able to get anybody ... - ... for at least a few days or a week . - A week ? A week does n't sound long . You do n't know how emotionally attached the people are to Old Vicky . Like when Granny dies , you lay her out in the parlor for some days , but you have to put her in the earth . Let people get on with their lives . - Out of sight , out of mind . - Yeah , something like that . Not to mention the wanton vandalism . Reducing to sawdust in a few minutes what took 100 years to create . Yeah . Artistically , we 're talking about some heavy-duty deconstruction . The absence of form in a reality plane . All right , well , we got a deal , then . I 'll pay you two dollars a board foot . - You bring your own hardhat . - No , we do n't have a deal . - What do you mean ? - Intellectually , it would be a gas . But , I read Heidegger in the shade of that tree . - Heidegger ? - " Being and Time " , his masterpiece . Authentic existence , unauthentic existence . So , you wo n't do it , huh ? I would n't feel right cutting Old Vicky down . But I do appreciate your offer . - More tree books . - Which ones ? " Control of White Pine Nematodes " and " Pathological Anatomy of Leaf Spots " . - It 's on loan . This is absolutely ridiculous . I 'll tell you something , botany aside . This is crazy . I 'm a physician . I have a sworn duty to heal . And now they 're asking me to sign the death sentence on Old Vicky here . Once she 's whittled down to firewood , you 'll be able to sleep at night . You wo n't sit here wondering is there just a chance , a sliver of hope that this tree might pull through . If only we 'd wait and do whatever you do to trees . You prune or spray or soil amendments . What ? - Your hand hurt ? - Yes , my hand hurts . It hurts more than my foot which I did n't think was possible . Hello , Dr . Fleischman ? Sorry to be a butt-in-ski , but I need to see you . All right . Marilyn , there 's a gastroenterologist named Lipkis . His brother has a tree group in L.A . All right ? L.A . , Tree People . Just let me have that paper-towel dress , I 'll get changed in a jiffy , a minute or less . Well , Shelly , I do n't think you need a gown . What I need is a throat culture , so just have a seat . Throat culture ? You 'll look in my mouth ? Hey , I got ta tell you , the baby , she 's much further south . That 's why I 'm here . For my prenatal check-up . My feet in the stirrups , my pee in a cup . You 're not here because of this singing thing ? I figure it 's like hiccoughs or gas what they say , this too will pass . Actually , I 'm not sure it will pass , Shelly . I 've never seen or heard anything quite like this . I do n't like the look on your face . Look , let 's not get too worried . I 'll do the prenatal , then we 'll get the throat culture a little later . Okay ? Is that all right ? But there 's a gown in that cabinet . I 'll go outside and let you change . Okay , Chris . Three , two , one , go . Cicely , this is Chris on K-Bear continuing the Arbor theme program live and on the scene from Old Vicky herself . Let 's keep on trucking with the resident of Walden Pond , this selection from The Mainwoods . I 've been into the lumberyard and the carpenter shop , the tannery , and the lamp factory , and the turpentine clearing , but when I left I saw the tops of the pines waving and reflecting the light of the distance high over ... Ed , that 's Thoreau . - Montgomery Cliff plays this priest and late on evening a parish employee stops by to confess he 's murdered a man . Ed , what does any of that have to do with you ? Well , see , it 's like this . About two years ago I was lying beneath Ootockalockatuvik with my girlfriend at the time , Light feather . And I wanted to show her how much I loved her , so ... - Well , I ... - You what ? I carved our initials into her trunk , put a heart around them . And now , she 's dying . Ed , whenever someone dies , it makes you think of the things you wish you 'd done . And the things you wish you had n't . I remember , a few years ago , my niece 's kids were up visiting . We were out berry picking . I turned my back , and they ran off . Yeah ? I made them come down afraid they 'd fall and break their necks . - And afterward , I felt bad . - Because you yelled at them . No . Because of what I 'd done to Vicky . Trees like to have kids climb on them . Right . But I 'm pretty sure Vicky forgave me . After all , she is a tree , and trees are much bigger than we are . And much , much more forgiving . Hey , Fleischman ! - Hi . I got some surgical brushes . - I did n't order any surgical brushes . I know . But , see , I was in Anchorage , and I walked by this medical supply store they were having a sale , I thought you could use some . All right , please , O'Connell , just stay right there . - Why ? - Why ? Keep your niceness to yourself . - O'Connell , I 'm not kidding . You are behaving like a genuine paranoid . You call this paranoid ? It this a figment of my imagination ? Am I hallucinating this cast ? - You can not blame me for that . - Yes , I can . I 'd be perfectly fine if you had n't unnerved me with all your good will . Now , I wo n't have any more of it . - Fine . What am I to do with these ? - I do n't know , but ... All right , gentlemen . Let 's take her down . Hold it , Minnifield . We have n't heard from doc yet . He had till 12 . It 's a quarter past . I say time 's up . You wo n't lay a finger on that tree until we get Fleischman 's report . You 've been a thorn in my side for years , Springer . - Where 's Fleischman ? - He 's had a bad fall . - Well , what about Vicky ? - He 's entrusting me with his report . - Well , you want to read it to us ? - Yeah . It says here ... " After consulting with arborists from the Tree People organization , it is my opinion that the Black Cottonwood , known as Old Vicky , has developed an infectious process of a fungal etiology . Although leaf desiccation and decline in vigor could be symptomatic of several agents , the mycelia appressed to the sapwood are a clear indication of Armillaria mellea , commonly known as Shoestring Rot . " - What the hell does that mean ? - Let the man finish , Springer . " Shoestring Rot is a fatal illness which is not responsive to treatment . Research shows the rate of degeneration is swift . Read all you want to . It wo n't change a thing . All right , men . Let them rip ! May , 1988 . I was picking wild flowers for the spring pow-wow . All of a sudden it got cloudy . It started to hail . Hail stones as big as baseballs . Luckily I was near Old Vicky . I got under her branches . She kept me safe . If it had n't been for Ootockalockatuvik , I could have gotten a concussion or worse . - To Vicky . - To Vicky . How are you ? Look , I 've been doing some research into your condition . What I need to know is , was there any prior indication anything was up with your speech . Or did it occur spontaneously ? It 's important . - Shelly ? What 's going on ? - I 'm not sure , Joel . She was so happy , chirping away like a robin in May . Look I got some good news here . I 've found some precedents for her singing , believe it or not . Yeah , listen to this . " Santiago , Chile . A 14-year-old girl walks into a music store , picks up a violin , plays the Bach Chaconne in D-minor . This is a girl who has no musical instruction whatsoever . But , Joel , how can that be ? No one knows . But the point is , there 's been a few similar cases of this spontaneous , prodigious ability in healthy people . Her singing may not necessarily be symptomatic of a particular illness . - That certainly is a great relief . - Yeah , well , I should think . But , tell me . This girl from Chile . Did she ever stop playing the violin ? - Stop playing ? - Did she go back to the way she was ? I do n't know . There was no mention of what happened after . He says tree or no tree , you still do not have free reign to build a structure that will negatively impact on me . He 's filing for an injunction ! You hear what I 'm saying ? You 're never going to build that storehouse ! - Does n't matter . - What ? What did you say ? I said it does n't matter . I do n't care about the storehouse . What do you mean , you do n't care about the storehouse ? You 've been crazy to build that thing for the past 15 years ! What the hell are you trying to pull ? See this ? This is the scene of my greatest triumph . I should be jubilant . I should be grinding Old Vicky 's leaves and feeding her limbs into a wood stove . But you know what I 'm feeling now ? I do n't feel anything . You 're just trying to throw me off balance . It wo n't work . I 'm still getting that injunction . To tell you the truth , I sort of miss the sight of her . My little bunny-face , my teenie-beanie cuddly thing , I got big bummer news , your mama ca n't talk , your mama can only sing . No faking , no fooling , she flaps her lips and out comes crooning . Baby learns to use a spoon . Mama only sings a tune . Baby counts from one to three , Mom makes a melody . Baby falls and bangs a knee , Sorry , here 's a rhapsody . How can you love a mom who ca n't gab or chatter ? No yak or yabber , chew the fat , jaw and jammer ? Can you love a mom who dewlaps and scats , she warbles , yodels , spits scales . She bops and raps . My little bunny-face , my teenie-beanie cuddly thing , I got big bummer news , your mama ca n't talk , your mama can only sing . In my opinion , talk comes cheap . Who needs to make a speech ? The truth is , my lovely bride , sing or talk , I 'm by your side . My little bunny-face , my teenie-beanie cuddly thing , do n't you feel lonely , do n't you feel blue , ' cause I 'll be singing with you . No faking , no fooling . I 'll be singing with you . It 's open ! - Hey , Fleischman . - Hey . What a surprise . How 's the neck ? Look , if you do n't mind , I 'd rather dispense with the pleasantries , okay ? Well , all right . Do you want to sit down ? - No , I wo n't stay that long . - Well , suit yourself . Look , ever since we 've known each other you 've related to me in a very consistent manner . You insult me , and you hit me , and you crashed me in your airplane . And I guess what I 'm here to do is to ask you , or to plead with you , if necessary , to just stop being so nice to me . It 's a small town , and I ca n't avoid you . And up till now , thank God , none of these injuries have been permanently disabling . But if this niceness continues , I think anything could happen . Okay . I can try to modify my behavior , but , I 'd like something in return . All right . Well , name it . You have to stop being such a jerk . - Could you be a bit more specific ? - Well , all right . The petulance , arrogance , whining , spite , sarcasm , the incessant , petty meanness , that sort of thing . Arrogance and petty meanness ? O'Connell , look . If I resort to sarcasm , it 's only because ... Because , because ..... - No buts . No ifs . No explanations , no negotiations . These are the terms . - Fine . I will definitely try . - Okay . Hey , get lost . I 'm hungry . Okay . Could 've saved yourself a lot of dough and sweat just putting in one of those two-gallon saplings . In a hundred years nobody would know the difference . The hell with posterity . I 'm doing this for me . When Old Vicky came down , I could n't stand the empty sky . I needed something to fill it . If you 'll bring me that bucket over there , will you ? - What is this stuff ? - Vitamin B1 , prevents root shock . There , that ought to do it . Ripped by subXpacio and TusSeries

Hey , here she comes ! Can you believe this ? In , like , two hours I 'm gon na have a dad . Yeah , big stuff ! Okay , let 's go ! Here , you have to hold this . " Brake , left . The paramedics had to cut through it . Come on , just tell me . Please , please ! For the 16th time : No , I do not think you 're obsessive ! - It 's hot in here ! - Rach , get the heat . Ross , turn the heat down , please ? The difference between obsessive ... Ross , the heat ! Okay ! Heat , heat , heat ! And I 'm the obsessive one ? This way is on . So this is off . Did you just break the radiator ? No , I was turning the knob and here it is . Well , put it back ! It wo n't go back . I 'll call the super . Here , let me try . That 's right . I forgot about your ability to fuse metal . Hey , it 's Funny 's cousin Not Funny ! Hi , Mr . Treeger ? It 's Rachel Greene from upstairs . Could we have a new one by 6 ? Tuesday ? We ca n't wait until Tuesday . We 're having a party tonight . Okay , tip the man . If he does n't like our cookies , too bad . I wo n't be blackmailed . Look , if it gets a little warm it can be a theme party . Here 's a theme : " Come on in , live like bacon ! " This is it ! Seventy-four . So that 's what this is for ! This is it . I 'm gon na meet my dad . This is like the biggest thing ever . Sure is . Here I go . I 'm going in . All right ! Good luck , Pheebs . Here I go . Here I go . I 'm going . Welcome to our tropical Christmas party . Put your coats , sweaters , pants and shirts in the bedroom . It 's hard to tell because I 'm sweating but I use exactly what the gel bottle says . Monica ! Your guests are turning into jerky . Really ? I 'm perfectly comfortable . Hey ! Get in line , buddy . I was next . Mr . Treeger . You said there was a party . Well , hey , welcome to our sauna . Is it hot ? My body always stays cool . Probably because I have so much skin . Hey , cheese ! Here 's the chance . Monica , give him cash . Rachel , give him your earrings . Something . Anything ! No , I will not cave . I 'm with Mon . All right . You know how you say I never seize the day ? Even though he 's your super , I 'm seizing . Mr . Treeger ? Here is $50 . Merry Christmas . I did n't get you anything . Here 's five back . No , that 's your Christmas tip . Ross ? He 's playing baseball . You mean hardball ? Whatever . What you gon na do ? Excuse me . I 'm seizing . Mr . Treeger ? Here 's another 50 . Happy Hanukkah . Will this help with the knob-getting ? No , the place is not open till Tuesday . Am I not saying it right ? So you really did like my cookies ? Yeah , they were so personal . It really showed you cared . Nice seizing gel boy . Is this mistletoe ? No , that ... That is basil . If it was mistletoe , I was gon na kiss you . No , it 's still basil . Chestnuts roasting on an open fire Jack Frost nipping at your nose - How far did you get ? - Mailbox . All right , we 're getting closer . What 's going on ? It 's just like a whole mess of stuff . Like yesterday , my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy . Yeah , maybe ! And I 'll knock on the door and he 'll hug me , and I 'll have a dad ! I 'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me because , you know , I 'm Frank 's daughter . So why not go knock ? Because , I mean , what if he 's not this great-dad guy ? What if he 's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us ? You know what ? I 've already lost a fake dad this week . I do n't think I 'm ready to lose a real one . Pheebs , that 's okay . You took a big step today . Someday , when you 're ready , you 'll make it past the hedges . And when you do , he 'll be lucky to have you . You guys ... Sorry about your shopping . Oh , that 's okay . We 'll figure something out . Cool , snow ! Kind of like a blank canvas . Ho-ho-ho-holy crap , is it hot in here ! You mind if I turn the heat down ? We could have used that kind of thinking earlier ! So , Pheebs , how did it go ? Oh , I could n't go in . - Honey , I 'm sorry . - Are you okay ? Yeah , it 's okay , because I know he 's there . So that 's enough for now . Hey , it 's after midnight ! Merry Christmas , everyone ! Oh , right ! Merry Christmas ! The knob was broken so I turned it off from underneath . I hope that 's all right . Ah , thanks . Okay . I guess that just leaves the gifts from Joey and Chandler . Rach , these are for you . Wiper blades ! I do n't even have a car . No , but with this new-car smell , you 'll think you do ! And for Ross Mr . Sweet Tooth . You got me a cola drink ? And a lemon-lime ! Well , this is too much ! I feel like I should get you another sweater . And last , but not least ... They 're ribbed for your pleasure ! 
@@5241841 Captain 's Log , Stardate 46357.4 . We have rendezvoused with the Starship Cairo near the Cardassian border for an urgent meeting with Vice-Admiral Nechayev . Come . May I present Captain Jean-Luc Picard . Admiral , welcome on board . Thank you . That 'll be all , Commander . Can I get you some coffee , tea ... ? Thank you , no , Captain . I 'm afraid there 's no time for the usual pleasantries . I 'm here to relieve you of command of the Enterprise . Space , the final frontier . These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise . Its continuing mission ... to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before . The Cardassian forces which were recently withdrawn from the Bajoran sector have been redeployed along the Federation border . They have mobilized three divisions of ground troops and their subspace communications have been increased by 50% . We believe that they 're preparing for an incursion into Federation space . We think they 're gambling that the Federation wo n't actually go to war over one system . Will we ? I hope we wo n't need to make that decision . We have decided to send the Enterprise to meet with a Cardassian representative and open talks . We 're hoping that the presence of the Federation flagship on the border will send a message to their leadership about just how seriously we view this situation . Where is Captain Picard ? The Captain , your Chief Medical Officer and Security Chief have been reassigned . That 's all I can tell you for now . Do any of you know Edward Jellico ? He is the commanding officer of the Cairo . I 've heard of him . I do n't know that any of us have ever ... I 'm giving him command of the Enterprise this afternoon . Thank you . Admiral , with all due respect ... it 's not necessary to give Captain Jellico command of the Enterprise just to conduct a negotiation . I disagree . The Enterprise will be in a dangerous situation and I want someone on the Bridge who has a great deal of experience with the Cardassians . No offense , Commander , but that 's not you . Halt ! Computer , freeze program . You were five seconds slower that time . You increased the difficulty level , sir . Mr . Worf , It 's going to be far more difficult where we 're going . Which is where , exactly ? I 'm sorry , I ca n't tell you that yet . It would be helpful to know something about our mission . Mr . Worf , I have my orders . I 'm sure you understand that . Now , Doctor , this deflector was n't set properly . It must be positioned so that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway or it 's useless . Sorry . Or maybe it was the falling rocks ? I understand this is difficult . All I can do is ask you to trust me . All right , let 's do it again . All right , Mr . Worf I want you to time the Doctor and me through that first tunnel , and this time we 're going to pick up those five seconds . Welcome aboard , sir . I 'm Commander ... William T . Riker , class of ' 57 . Graduated eighth in his class . I 'm looking forward to serving with you , Commander . Thank you , and I , you . I 'm sure this change in command has taken everyone a little by surprise . Well ... yes , sir . It caught me by surprise , too . I must admit , I miss the Cairo already but a Galaxy-class ship , that 's something special . I can understand why you turned down a ship of your own to remain aboard . Yes , sir . I 'd also like to examine the duty roster and the crew evaluations as soon as possible . I want readiness reports from each department head by 1400 hours and a meeting of the senior staff at 1500 . Do you prefer Will or William ? Um , Will sir . Where are my quarters , Will ? We have you assigned to cabin 735 ... - deck seven ... - Deck seven . I 'll see you at 1300 hours . Attention to orders . " To Captain Jean-Luc Picard " Commanding Officer , USS Enterprise . " Stardate 46358.1 . " You are hereby requested and required " to relinquish command of your vessel " to Captain Edward Jellico " Commanding Officer , USS Cairo " as of this date . " Signed , Vice-Admiral Alynna Nechayev Starfleet Command . " Computer , transfer all command codes to Captain Edward Jellico . Voice authorization : Picard-delta-five . Transfer complete . USS Enterprise now under command of Captain Edward Jellico . I relieve you , sir . I stand relieved . I do n't know . They do n't usually go through the ceremony if it 's just a temporary assignment . Sore ? Oh ... sore does n't begin to describe it . I know . I wish I could talk about it . Most of the secondary systems were changed at the last overhaul . I do n't think they 'll give you any problem but you might want to check out the port lateral ... I 'll take care of the Enterprise , Jean-Luc . You do n't have to mother me . Uh ... how 's your team shaping up ? Very well ... but I would prefer more recent intelligence on the exact layout of the installation . The most current information that we have is two years old . Two years ? I do n't know how Nechayev ever talked you into this . She gave me no choice . Well , maybe there 's something we can do to help . We 'll launch a class-5 probe just before we reach the border . Captain . I believe we 're scheduled to arrive at the Cardassian border during delta shift . Please inform the delta tactical officer that I want to launch a class-5 probe just before we drop out of warp . I was actually going to talk to you about delta shift a little later , sir . Right now , gamma shift will be on duty when we arrive and I will tell Lieutenant McDowell about the probe . Is there a problem with delta shift , Will ? There is no delta shift yet , sir . I have spoken to the department heads about changing from three shifts to four and they assure me it 's going to cause us significant personnel problems . So you have not changed the watch rotation ? I was going to explain this to you after the ceremony , sir . You will tell the department heads that as of now the Enterprise is on a four-shift rotation . I do n't want to talk about it . Get it done . Is that clear ? Yes , sir . If you 'll excuse me , sir . Captain . He was your first officer for five years ... One of the finest officers that I have ever served with . Of course he is , Jean-Luc . I 'm sure it 'll all work out . Captain 's Log , Stardate 46358.2 . The Enterprise is on course for a rendezvous with the Cardassian ship Reklar . Fortunately , I still have time to prepare the ship and crew for the task ahead . I want you to install a bypass between the main phaser array and the secondary generators . I also want to run the main deflector pathway through the warp power grid and the auxiliary conduits through the lateral relays . Now , you may have to reconfigure the transfer interface . Sir , the transfer interface was not designed for that configuration . It will take seven hours to make those changes . It 's not good enough . If these negotiations fail we could find ourselves in a war zone and if that happens I want to be loaded for bear . I 'll get right on it . Good . Now , these stations should be devoted to damage-control and weapons status from now on . See that they 're manned at all times . Aye , sir . Mr . Data , how long before we reach the rendezvous point ? We will arrive in 51 hours , 32 minutes , sir . Schedule four battle drills one for each shift . Run a series of simulated attacks from a Cardassian squadron . I want you to conduct the exercises personally , Will . Get it done . Oh ... And get that fish out of the ready room . Data , you 're with me . The power transfer levels need to be upgraded by 20% . The efficiency of your warp coils is also unsatisfactory . Coil efficiency is well within specifications , Captain . 15 percent ? That is an attainable goal but it will require realigning the warp coil and taking the secondary distribution grid off-line . Very good , Data . That 's exactly what I want you to do . If we take this grid off-line we 're going to have to shut down exobiology , the astrophysics lab and geological research . We 're not on a research mission . Get it done ... in two days . I believe that is also an attainable goal . If we utilize the entire engineering department there should be sufficient manpower available to complete the task . Sure , if everybody works around the clock for the next two days . Then you 'd better get to it , Geordi . Looks like you have some work to do . Data . Yes ? May I speak with you , Captain ? Deanna , come in , come in . The latest masterpieces from my son . It 's an elephant ... I think . Definitely an elephant . I 'm glad you 're here . I 've noticed some resistance . I would n't call it resistance . More like ... uncertainty . Most of them had served under Captain Picard for several years . They knew him and they knew what he expected . Now they 're being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things and they 're uncertain how to react . I see your point . This all could be very unsettling to them . And to you . Perhaps everyone just needs time . Time for you to get to know and trust the crew , and time for them to understand how you want things done . I 'm glad you brought this to my attention , Deanna . Unfortunately , I do n't have time for a honeymoon with the crew . You 've clearly given this a lot of thought So I 'd like you to take charge of the morale situation . Oh , I have a meeting with the new security chief in five minutes so the duty roster will have to wait . Thank you , Counselor . By the way ... I prefer a certain ... formality on the Bridge . I 'd appreciate it if you wore a standard uniform when you 're on duty . Of course , sir . Commander , he 's asked me to completely reroute half the power systems on this ship change every duty roster realign the warp coils in two days and now he 's transferred a third of my crew to security . If it makes you feel any better , you 're not alone . Captain Jellico has made major changes in every department on the ship . Yeah , well , I do n't mind making changes and I do n't mind hard work but the man is n't giving me the time I need to do the work . Somebody 's got to get him to listen to reason . It 's not going to be me . Maybe he can do something . We just need a little time . All right . Come . You all right , sir ? Yes , I am but the last time I had to train like this was for the Academy Marathon but ... I 'm managing . What can I do for you ? It 's nothing urgent . I 'm sorry I bothered you . Good night . My orders are to maintain radio silence until we 've completed the mission . Well , the Enterprise will be monitoring your channel just in case you do need to transmit a signal . Bridge to Captain Jellico . We 've arrived at the shuttle departure coordinates . Did you launch the probe I requested ? Yes , sir . I was n't aware you wanted to be informed . Thank you . Jellico out . I can see why he 's still only a first officer . Captain , I would just like you to know that Commander Riker ... I 've read your reports , Jean-Luc . He 's been decorated by Starfleet Command five times . He 's been offered his own ship more than once . I think if you just gave him a chance you would find him an outstanding officer . Jean-Luc , let 's be candid for a moment . The Cardassians are n't going to listen to reason and the Federation is n't going to give in to their demands and the chances are you wo n't be coming back from this mission of yours . I want this ship ready for action and I do n't have time to give Will Riker or anyone else a " chance . " And forgive me for being blunt , but the Enterprise is mine now . Well ... here 's hoping you beat the odds . Good hunting . Thank you . Jean-Luc ... I believe this is yours . Shuttlecraft Feynman to Enterprise . We have cleared the shuttle bay . Acknowledged , Feynman . Good luck . Thank you , Enterprise . Well ... now that we 're underway I can tell you about our mission . I am not familiar with metagenics . They 're genetically engineered viruses that are designed to destroy entire ecosystems . When metagenic toxins are released into a planet 's atmosphere they immediately begin to mutate . They seek out and destroy all forms of DNA they encounter . In a few days , everything is dead . In a month , the metagenic agent itself breaks down and dissipates completely leaving every city , every road , every piece of equipment perfectly intact . Leaving the planet safe to be conquered . Would n't using such a weapon pose as great a risk to the attacker as to the target ? That 's why metagenics and other biological weapons were outlawed years ago . Even the Romulans have abided with those agreements . Starfleet Intelligence believes that the Cardassians are developing a new delivery system one that would protect them from accidental exposure to the toxin . They believe that the Cardassians are testing a way of launching dormant metagenic material on a subspace carrier wave . Now , for the past few weeks , theta-band subspace emissions have been detected coming from Celtris III . These emissions may indicate that a metagenic delivery system is in operation . What do we know about Celtris III ? Very little . It was thought to be uninhabited until these emissions were detected . Starfleet believes that the Cardassians may have a secret research lab located somewhere below the planet 's surface . Our orders are to penetrate this Celtris III installation and determine if the Cardassians are actually building a metagenic weapon . And if they are ? Destroy it ... at any cost . When I was on the Stargazer we conducted extensive tests using theta-band carrier waves . One of the reasons I was selected for this mission is my familiarity with the methods used for generating them . Mr . Worf , your presence here is obvious ... know a way of acquiring some discreet transport . Mr . Worf , set a course for Torman V . If he does n't pay up , I know three large Ferengi who will not be so forgiving . I did n't do it . We 're not accusing you of anything . What do you want then ? We 're looking for DaiMon Solok . Why ? We have a business proposition to discuss . Solok is a very busy , very important man . He is n't here . But I could relay a message . Good . Please , will you tell DaiMon Solok that we 're interested in transportation ... to Celtris III ? That 's a Cardassian planet . Uh-huh . Now , we understand that DaiMon Solok runs cargo there from time to time . Solok is no smuggler . Yes , but if Solok were to go to Celtris III for legitimate reasons we would be interested in quietly booking passage for the journey . Why ... yes . He is a ... extraordinary man . That 's why we came here because only Solok could help us ... but I guess there are some things even Solok ca n't do . It 's too bad . Because ... if he could , I would be ... very ... very ... Yes ? Grateful . When do you want to leave ? Beverly , make sure that your tricorder is keeping a precise map of the route . It would be very easy to get lost in here . Right . I 'm picking up some subspace signals but I ca n't seem to get a lock on them . That 's typical of theta-band emissions . You have to compress the detection bandwidth in order to determine the fix . The source emission is 500 meters east of here , and ... 700 meters below . It 's all right . They 're called lynars . They 're a kind of Celtran bat . They 're harmless . We have rendezvoused with the Cardassian ship Reklar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tensions along the border . Gul Lemec has arrived . He 's waiting for you in the observation lounge . Very good . I 'll be in my ready room . Yes ? Captain , I think there 's been a slight miscommunication . Did you want to meet with Gul Lemec in here ? No , the observation lounge is appropriate . I see . Lemec is a Cardassian and Cardassians are like timber wolves ... predators ... bold in large numbers , cautious by themselves and with an instinctive need to establish a dominant position in any social gathering . So you 're trying to establish a dominant position by making him wait for you . The trouble with wolves is that sometimes in the fight for dominance one of them ends up dead . In that case , the trick is to be the wolf that 's still standing at the end . The floor is over 500 meters down from here . This is sheer granite . We 'll have to use fusing pitons . We could try to find another way down . Unfortunately , that would take several hours . We do n't have the time . You 're not afraid of heights , are you , Doctor ? Of course not . Now , remember to control your descent . Do n't get the lines tangled . I 'll remember . All right ? What is going on ? I 've been waiting here for over an hour ... I 'm Captain Jellico . I believe you know Commander Riker and this is Lieutenant Commander Troi . Let 's get to it , shall we ? This treatment is a deliberate insult to the Cardassian Union . I have been kept waiting here for over an hour . Then I 'm sure you 're ready to talk . I did not agree to allow others into this meeting . If it alarms you , I can ask them to leave . I am not alarmed , but we did not ... I have come to negotiate a Federation withdrawal from the borders not to be dictated to by some mere Captain . I can see you 're not serious about these talks . If the Cardassian Union truly wishes to discuss peace they can send someone who can negotiate in a civilized manner . Captain on the Bridge . Let him stew for a few minutes . Then go in and tell him that you 've convinced me to meet with him one more time . Tell him I 'm a loose cannon and that he needs to be more reasonable because I 'm such an unreasonable man . Lemec will want to bring his own aides on board . Pretend to be worried that I 'll object , and then give grudging permission for two aides , no more . Understood ? - Aye , sir . - Aye , sir . Well , I 'll say this for him ... he 's sure of himself . No , he 's not . The installation should be about 300 meters ... I doubt it . That 's what I thought . Hmm ... There 's a lava tube beyond here that runs for 75 meters . Then it connects with another chamber . We need to get through here . This tube opens up beyond this crack . If we could widen the opening then we should be able to crawl through . Mr . Worf ? A phaser set at level 16 should suffice . Make it so . Well done , Mr . Worf . Gul Lemec . A pleasure . May I present my aides Glinn Corak and Glinn Tajor . Welcome aboard . For the past three weeks you 've been massing troops in staging areas assembling strike forces and pulling ships from their normal patrols . We will not stand for this clearly provocative behavior . I see the Federation spy network has again provided you with faulty information . We are conducting routine training operations nothing more . However , we are very concerned with your refusal to vacate those territories along the border which are clearly Cardassian . You gave up your claims on those territories when you signed the armistice . You could n't take those worlds by force , so you want us to give them to you at the bargaining table . Captain , please . We should listen to them . Gul Lemec , as you know the systems are still under negotiation by the terms of the treaty . Negotiations which we have pursued in good faith . Unfortunately , the Federation has not been as forthcoming . So , to speed up the process , you are preparing for war . We are preparing to defend ourselves . The Federation will not start a war . That has always been your position . However , I have heard reports that a small team from the Federation has already been sent into our territory . Of course , I do n't believe it . I do n't know what you 're talking about . Then there 's no need for worry . A brief recess would seem to be in order . Very well . Where is Captain Picard ? Reassigned . Well , I hope his new assignment is not too dangerous . It would be a shame if something were to happen to such a , uh ... such a noted officer . Yes ... it would . Only a few more meters . Beverly , get out of there ! Beverly ! I have her . Are you all right ? I think so . Next time , you try bringing up the rear . We 're nearly there . Can you continue ? It looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation . I 'm picking up three proximity sensors around it . Sensor echo is established but the false image will only last a few minutes . The hatch is magnetically sealed but I believe I can bypass it . I ca n't get a scan from the other side of the hatch . Ready . Now . There 's no one here . There 's no lab . It 's a trap . Come on ! Captain ! Let 's go . The Captain ! No . There are five more of them heading this way from another tunnel . Come on . Now ! Come on . Captain on the Bridge . What have you got , Will ? I 'm not sure . We 're picking up a lot of coded messages from a Cardassian planet near the border . Which planet ? Celtris III . Can you detect any theta-band subspace emissions coming from Celtris ? There are some residual traces . It seems that there were emissions up until a few minutes ago . Open a secure channel to Admiral Nechayev . Priority two . Put it through to my ready room . Aye , sir . Captain ? Those emissions you were so concerned about have just stopped . I 'd say one way or another our friends have finished their task . So would I , Admiral . A challenge . You should prove an interesting challenge . Possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years . What do you want ? Why , you , of course . Picard ... Jean-Luc . Serial number ... SP-937-215 . Son of Maurice and Yvette Picard . Born in Labarre , France . Formerly , Captain of the Stargazer where you conducted extensive studies on theta-band subspace carrier waves . Do n't look so surprised . How could we have designed a lure for the Captain of the Federation flagship unless we knew something about his background ? So you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here . Why ? In this room , you do not ask questions . I ask them . You answer . If I am not satisfied with your answers you will die . 
@@5242041  .  Case number 0386 -- St . Benedictine Monastery , Quebec . Now , me , personally , when I think of vows of obedience and silence , I do n't exactly think of Christopher Chance . In fact , the two are sort of like oil and water ... so I was n't real keen on taking the case in the first place . But then again , I could n't help thinking it might do Chance some good . You know , " redemption is thine . Seek and ye shall find . " I mean , traveling 1,000 miles on a case is a roundabout way of hoping to find something like that , but then again ... Brother Mitchell ?  Fate 's a funny thing . You know what ? Hold on . Wait , wait , wait . I 'm - - I 'm getting ahead of myself . Let me start at the beginning . This case , as they so often do , began with a crime -- A crime centered around a kid named John Gray . Nice guy . Now , Fisher would set his sights on high-dollar targets , then send John Gray in to case the place , which is how he met Emily . And the more he got to know her , the more he realized he wanted out of his old life so he could have a shot at a new one with her . So John called the cops ...  And managed to escape . But it did n't take long for Sam Fisher to escape too . He paid somebody off ... had them hide a little something to help his getaway .      With Fisher out , John Gray was suddenly in danger , which is why Emily came to us for help . John never hurt anyone . Look , he grew up on the streets , and he hustled to survive . He 's smart . I know how this sounds . But you have to believe me that John is a good man . Please ... You 're my chance to save him .  So where exactly is John now ? A monastery ? A remote monastery . 200 miles north of the border of Quebec . He 's there , he 's unarmed , probably . And as we speak , six of his heavily-armed buddies are on their way up there looking for retribution . So why hide out in a monastery ? Do n't know . Well , there 's got to be thousands of them - - why that one ? Do n't know . What , you do n't like " do n't know " now ? I thought " do n't know " was your favorite part of this job . No , you had me with heavily-armed crew invading a remote monastery , but that 's just me . " I do n't know " -- That usually scares the crap out of you . Ah ... This is a guy who 's trying to put those mistakes behind him . If we ca n't help a guy like that ... what the hell are we doing here ? So where exactly is this place ?  It 's up in the mountains , kust above a village called Port Cartier , and accessible only by cable car .  So we go up there , quietly find Gray and get him to safety , tip the cops in Fisher 's direction , problem solved .  Yeah , assuming we 're not too late already . Fisher and his men have been on the loose for days . There 's no way of knowing when they 'll reach the monastery . So let 's do this and do it quickly . Are you in position ? Brother Mitchell ? Yes . Yes , I am . Now , I have to admit , I was a little bit nervous about Chance on his own in a place of worship . As long as I 've known him , I 've never seen him set foot in a church either . I guess he 's not much of a religious man . At least , that 's what he tells me . Truth be told , I 'm not sure what the guy believes in . Funny story . I 'm headed up here , friend of mine says he knows a guy here . His name 's John Gray . Any idea how I could find him ? Oh . I get it . You 're kind of in the middle of something here . I wo n't bother you .  shh . Say , if I wanted to get everybody together here just in one room , how would I do that ?   Are all the monks there ? Mm-hmm . Do you see Gray ? Mm-mm . Okay . Uh , I got old testament . I got new testament . I got hymns . I got the lyrics to this little light of mine , If that does anything for you . It 's okay , I got it . Got it ? What do you mean , you got it ? I sought the lord , and he answered me ... delivered me from my fears . Look to him , and be radiant . Your faces shall not be ashamed . His poor soul cried and was heard by the lord . And was saved from every trouble . Psalms 34 , 4 through 6 . Amen .  That was n't half bad . Now ... Could we just get on with it and find our man , please ? I thought you said we 'd be in the clear After we crossed the border . Do n't worry about it . Good morning , officer . Is there a problem ? No , no problem . Standard roadside checks within 50 miles of the border . After you hide the body , head to the gondola station . Once we get to the top of the mountain , no one goes to or comes from that monastery . Um , excuse me . There 's a brother here that I 'm looking to connect with . His name is John Gray . I 've got a message for him , but I ca n't seem to find him . Of course not . It 's 11:00 . What 's at 11:00 ? He leads the alternative services ... in the library . So he has to sacrifice himself to save the one true earth . I do n't get it . What - - what do n't you get ? Well , in this one , he dies . Right . And then suddenly , in this one , he 's alive again . Exactly . Like jesus . I think I 've got him .  All right , let me know when you 're bringing him down . Can we help you ? John Gray ? I 'm assuming you 're still interested in the materials we spoke about ? I am . I can get those for you ... by tonight . I know how risky this job is for you , But I think you 'll be more than happy with your reimbursements . They 'll be ready for the exchange . See , that 's the thing that bothers me . Whenever a client does n't blink at my fee , I start asking questions about who I 'm working for . So what 's your point ? I just figure there 's someone bigger than you in the food chain involved , and I want to know who . I make the delivery , you spill the beans . We got a deal ? I get the item in my hands , we 'll talk . I 'm curious . What changed ? It was never about how I could do it .  It was always about when . With Chance and his partner out of the country , I finally got the opportunity I 've been waiting for . When I got it , I 'll call you . You need to listen to me . You 're in danger right now , and I 've been hired to come up here and protect you . Pr - - protect me from what ? Sam Fisher . He 's free , so is the rest of his crew , and they know where you are . H-how do they know where I am ? Emily . Emily ? Is she all right ? She 's fine . But they took the letters you sent her . This is - - this is bad . This is really bad . Yeah , well it 's gon na get a whole lot worse , but that 's where I come in . I 've got a car waiting for you at the bottom of the hill . No , I ca n't leave . I mean , if Fisher really is on his way here , I ca n't leave . It 's - - it 's complicated .  Complicated how exactly ? Um ... Hey . Hey , I just spotted the gondola going up the mountain . I thought you said you were gon na signal me when you were ready to come down . What the hell 's going on ?  Chance . Chance , are you reading me ? Did you call for the gondola ?   Once the grounds are secure , the priority is finding the object . Everything else comes second . You 're saying Gray gets to walk away from what he did ? I 'm saying once we get the object , Gray is fair game . Until then , we stick to the plan . Are we clear ? Are we clear ? Yeah . High-value antiquities , relics -- It was my job to nominate the targets . And you singled out this abbey . They 're a myth . Okay , just for fun , somebody want to fill me in here ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh , so the council of Nicea ... gathered in 397 to settle the nature of christianity itself . A bishop from jerusalem wrote an account of this meeting that was held in secret . It was passed down through the papal lines until it was lost in the 16th century during the sack of Rome . Then 400 years later , a sister in Austria reported seeing a book matching its description in the possession of an allied chaplain in Belgium -- Father Robert Regan . My predecessor at this monastery . Yeah . To the right buyer , that book is worth millions . And I figured I 'd get in , I 'd find the book , and I 'd get out . I 'd sell it , and I 'd take off for parts unknown . I 'm sorry . I suppose we always knew you 'd have to confront your past sooner or later . Wait a minute . But I also sensed a good man , seeking a better path . If I ca n't help a man like that ... what am I doing here ?  All right , this book ... Are we sure Fisher knows about it ? This monastery was supposed to be our next job After the museum . We had it all planned out . Listen , when Fisher gets here , he 's gon na tear this place apart looking for it . People are gon na get hurt . Why do n't we just give it to him ? I would . Only I do n't have it . Chance , are you there ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm still here . Oh , good . Lost you for a second there . Listen , we got a major problem . I just made one of Fisher 's guys down here at the gondola station , And that gondola 's been up there About ten minutes now , which means ... Wait a minute .  Chance . Chance ! No , no ! Aah ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I - -   Oh , my .  This is Guerrero . It 's Winston ! Where the hell have you been ? I called you , like , 30 times in the last 10 minutes ! All right , listen . I thought this job was straightforward , but it 's gotten kind of complicated , and I 'm gon na need your help . Busy today , dude . Sorry . You 're busy ? Chance and the principal are in danger . What the hell could you be so busy with it ca n't wait ? Dude , my life does not revolve around you , as hard as that may be for you to believe . I 'm on another job . Another -- Look , Fisher and his crew are here . Now Chance is stuck up on that mountain with those psychopaths . Well , I know who he means . That guy 's not really an option . We kind of had a falling out . Well , ca n't you apologize ? Yeah , if I had , like , a time machine or a hell of a ouija board . Listen , you 're gon na be fine , man . You 're , uh ... capable . Capable ? Hey , who the hell do you think you 're talking -- Got to go .  C-4 . It 's enough to level this place . When Fisher does a job , he never leaves any witnesses . We 're gon na have to do something to save those monks . How can I help ? You want to help ? We got to find this book before they do , before they blow this monastery right off the map . So what happens next ?  Fisher and his crew came for the annals . So what 's the deal , you never found this thing ? No , it 's not that . I just never got around to taking it . I mean , it 's underneath the monastery . It 's in the old church foundation . Underneath where ? The crypt . Abbot Regan used it to store everything He brought back from the war . He always talked about the pieces he got in all those churches in France and Belgium . I just assumed they were souvenirs - - junk . Well , apparently not . How do we get down there ? The crypt is connected to the abbey through a network of tunnels , built during prohibition . I thought I was the only one here who knew about it . There 's several entrances off the grounds , But only one inside the abbey . Where is it ?  unfortunately , it 's right behind where Fisher is holding the monks hostage . The entrance is below a slab , just behind the altar . How are we supposed to do that ? I mean , even if we could get past him , this place is an echo chamber . As soon as we move the slab , he 's gon na hear us . If you get your hands on the book , this all ends , yes ? It 's a good start . Go . I 'll make sure they ca n't hear you . No , no ! It 's too dangerous . Let me - - let me do it . Go . We went through the wine cellar , the basement , nothing . Not to mention , there 's still no sign of Gray . It could take hours to search every inch of this place . Do you realize this ? Maybe we 've just been taking the wrong approach .   Go find who 's doing that .   Son of a bitch .  damn it , Winston , ca n't you take a hint ? I 'm pretty sure I said I 'd call you .  I 'm aware , but I thought it would n't hurt to check in to see how you were progressing . Is n't that sweet . I 'm still kind of in the thick of it here , and I think you and I both know this is n't something that would just be lying out in the open . Well aware . After all , if this material was n't so personal to its owner , we would n't be so eager to get our hands on it . Right . I 'll be in touch . So , you 've been here about a year . You 've got a pretty good idea where this thing was . Tell me the part again why you did n't just take off with it ? Well , that was the plan when I first got here . Emily . Yeah . I started writing to her , and , you know , she had no good reason to respond , and then she wrote back . She thanked me for saving her . She made you feel like one of the good guys . Do n't worry , happens to the best of us . Hey , are you sure we went the right way back there ? Pretty sure .  Oh ! Oh , man . Thank God . I 've been walking for miles . The gondola 's closed for the day . Gondola ? Man , I do n't need a gondola . I need some gas . You got a town back there with no gas station . You guys do n't have any gas stashed up here , do you ? Sorry . Aw ... Well , you got a landline in the office ? I just have to make a phone call . I got no bars . It 's a local call . I got the number right here . You mind holding this for me ? Look , pops . You got to go . Come on , man . It 'll only take a second ! Capable . This place is way bigger than I thought . What was her name ? Who ? Made you feel like one of the good guys . Oh , that bad , huh ? What happened ? It just did n't work out . So what exactly are we looking for , anyway ? It 's a small box . It 's probably some kind of treated wood with a bronze lock on the lid . I thought it was a book . Well , it 's a scroll , actually . Pope Clement had it sealed in the box when he fled Rome to protect it . It can only be opened with his papal ring . Papal rings are destroyed after their pope dies . So if you try and open it without the ring , its contents are destroyed . Acid ? Maybe . Maybe a flint . What would somebody want with a book you ca n't read ? Well ...  I had a buyer lined up in Spain who was willing to pay $4.5 million for it as is . Tell you what , when we get out of here , I 'll give you his number , you can ask him yourself . Years I worked with Gray -- Not even once was he wrong about a score . I know the book is here . Do yourself a favor and tell me where it is , and this can all be over .  Go to hell .  Stop !  Yes ? I know where Gray went . Hey , everything is very fragile , okay ? So be careful with that stuff . Hey , what 's this ? You said a bronze lock , right ?  That 's it .  That 's it ! It 's in a tunnel underneath the monastery . Now , look , there 's an exit in a pine grove about a klick north of the compound . You 'll take Gray and the book . I 'm gon na stay here and see if I can get these monks out in one piece . Where are you now ? I 'm in the gondola heading up the mountain . What about the chopper ? There is no chopper . You did n't get the chopper ? At the moment , I 'm all you 've got . Guerrero said the pilot was unavailable , Not that he was in any hurry to get us another one . By the way , he said he was on another job . Any idea what that 's about ? No idea . Call him back . Yeah .    I 'm not exactly sure what I 'm doing here or where any of this is going , But I figure I should start keeping track of all this . And for what it 's worth , I hope he can get past this one , Because this case was damn ugly . Her name was Katherine . I need you to take this , go up to the exit , and meet my partner . Where are you gon na go ? I 'm gon na go up to the chapel , see if I can sort out that mess . I 'm going with you . Forget it . Forget it ? No . I ca n't just run and let everyone else go through this . I mean , I have to go up there . I have to face Fisher . All right , let me spoil the ending for you . This feeling you have right now frequently precedes death . Now , a few months ago , Fisher was in prison and not your problem , but now things are different . I have to try . There 's a woman that cares enough about your life to hire me . Wait , it does n't have to be like this . Well , unfortunately , you do n't have a lot to bargain with right now . I assume that 's the book . So I have it , and I have you . But you do n't have the ring . Excuse me ? Pope Clement 's ring . You use it to unlock the scroll 's container . Before I came here , I found it at an auction in Chicago . Seller did n't know what it was . No one 's laid eyes on that scroll in five centuries . It 's worth $4 million locked up . Can you imagine what it 's worth unlocked ? Where ? In a safety deposit box in a bank at the bottom of the mountain . You let everybody go , I 'll take you to it . He 's bluffing . He better not be . You all right ? Never better . What 's happening ? Gray made a deal . He sacrificed himself . I do n't get the sense that they intend to honor that deal . Neither do I . I do n't understand . Why did Gray trust them ? He did n't , but he just got five of their guys out of the room . Now we just got to get past this one . One still seems like a lot given our current situation . We 're working on that . Hey , buddy .  Probably be a really good time to stop doing what you 're doing . You hold your gun like a cop . From what I understand , cops do n't go around shooting people . I 'm retired . Oh , no , no , no , no !  Damn ! He just started the timer . We got three minutes and counting . I got to go catch that gondola . Wait , wait a minute . What about everybody else here ? Even if I could cut all their restraints , we 'd never clear the blast . Diffuse the detonator ! That was n't me ! Are you sure ? What do you mean , am I sure ? It was n't me ! I was n't there ! It was probably Guerrero . What about the thing in Detroit ? Oh , yeah , that was close . Also Guerrero ! I do n't know what to tell you . Call Guerrero .   Used to be when you told a guy you were busy , that was respected . I do n't give a rat 's ass about any of that . I 'm talking about looking at ten blocks of C-4 that are wired to blow in two minutes . So if the next words out of your mouth are n't which wire to cut , I swear to -- Dude , you 're unspooling . Calm down . Describe the setup . Hold on .  All right , I got two wires , both going to the switch -- One red , one blue . Red , definitely red . Wait .  What was that ? Did you just flip a coin ? No . I heard a slapping sound ! Look , dude . I know this is n't what you want to hear right now , but sometimes you just got to go with your gut . Winston ? Winston ? Winston ! In case you 're wondering , It was the blue wire ! Good to know . Tom . Tom , what 's your status ?       Oh , my God !      Bring him up ... Slowly . I 'm gon na need your other hand . What ? Grab the gun . I got you . You can do this . One , two , three .    You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I 'm fine .  Well played .  Thank you .  you sure about this ? Yeah , I-I-I 've been treading water for too long .  Good luck with everything . You make it sound like our paths will never cross again . Well , short of another reformed fugitive with a violent gang on his tail seeking refuge or you getting into the security business in San Francisco , I 'd say it 's a pretty slim Chance . Funny . I 'm not so convinced . Oh , God . It 's so good to see you . Got to hand it to him , turning himself in like that . How much time do you think he 's gon na get ? Well , between Emily corroborating That he was the one that called the cops at the museum , the fact that the rest of Fisher 's crew is back in prison , uh , more or less a year , give or take , less with good behavior . What 's that ? Oh , this ? It 's , uh , Pope Clement 's ring . He used it to unlock the Nicene Annals . As a gift ? Payment . Let me get this straight . You got a ring that opens a very expensive book that we do n't have . So in other words , it 's just gon na be another piece of junk gathering dust on your shelf ? Maybe . Maybe there 's something else out there that it opens . Oh , that 's a hell of a plan . Hold on a second . Yeah , maybe it unlocks next month 's electric bill . You know , maybe a car note , or maybe the mortgage to this damn place , you know ? Oh , yeah - - oh , that 's good . Good , good . Just walk away . Walk away . This ai n't important . Hey . Minimum security 's not that bad . You 're gon na play squash with some I-bankers , eat some overcooked macaroni and cheese . You 'll be out of there before you know it . Yeah , right . Hey , let me ask you something . Thanks for everything .  I saw the look on his face as he watched Emily and Gray together , and I knew exactly what he was thinking . Of course he 'd never admit it , but ... but I know now that he still has n't gotten over her . He 's never gotten over Katherine . It 's what you asked for . We 've been anxious to get a hold of this .  But it 's more than that , though . I know he still has n't forgiven himself for what happened . Well , I kept up my end of the deal . Now I 'd like to know who you 're working for . You 're in no position to make demands . When we need something more , we 'll contact you .  I just hope that one day the man will just stop looking for salvation . He does n't get to just walk away , not after everything he did .  And it 's not something someone can find for you either . It 's something you have to give yourself . You think you can protect him ? You ca n't . We 'll see . 
@@5242141 Okay . What do you think of them ? Oh . I knew you 'd hate ' em . God . it 's just a stupid invention . What made me think that a little pillow that cups and cushions the ass against the ravages of subway travel would be a good idea ? I like the name ... " The Subway Tush .

Well . let 's not delve into that one too deeply . Now . I thought we 'd start by you talking - about how you first came up with -- - No . no . no . You do the talking . That 's what you 're good at . See . you 're the quarterback . I 'm just the slutty cheerleader with the nice rack . All right . Well . if you feel like chiming in -- No . no . no .

You wan na put everything you 've got into my Tush ? Well . that 's not the way legal would put it . but yes . This is great ! Oh my God . I ca n't wait to tell Will ! Oh . yeah . about that . We want him out . Oh . he is . Everybody knows . No . I mean " out " as in " out . " What ? It 's just that your presentation was so dynamic . We 'd like him gone . So . what are you saying ? You expect me to sell out my business partner and best friend of 13 years for a scrap of foam rubber and a few measly shekels ? How dare you . sir ? How dare you ? This is what we are prepared to offer . He 'll be gone by tomorrow . - Hey . Will . - Hello . Jack . - Whatcha reading ? - A book . - Would I like it ? - No . there 's nothing to color in . Look . I spoke to the investors after you left today ... And ? And ... there 's something I should tell you . - Sit down . - I am sitting down . Okay . you do n't have to bite my head off ! They said . um ... they said ... they need to think about it . They need to think about it . - Yeah . - Okay . Let me explain what that means . Jack ? Because of you . - Will . I do n't think -- - Exactly ! You do n't think ! I mean . first you start with that ridiculous song-and-dance number . with Hey . mon fr ? re , with your derri ? re Could use a little - - thpp . What the hell is that ? ! - You said to chime in . - Yes . but by " chime " I did not mean " The Bell of Saint Mary . " - Will . Listen -- - No . then - - then you bend over in front of Lawrence Weber . a grandfather of four and a large contributor to the Republican National Committee . and ask him to squeeze your happy heinie ! Hey . I got a vibe from him . but that 's a whole ' nother story . And to top it all off . you produce ... this - - this sad . obscene thing . this ... butt puppet . Buttford happens to be our spokes-puppet . and then addressed people with it . They were laughing . You turned a meeting with my colleagues into Circus-O-Gay ! All of this adds up to the fact that we 're not gon na get any financing . because people do not generally give large sums of money to crass . juvenile performing monkeys ! Then how come they want me and not you ? Because I - - what ? Yeah . that 's right . They said you think too small . They want you out . They liked my vision . they liked my energy . they liked my passion . And they liked Buttford ! They sent me here to fire you . So ... now who 's the monkey . huh ? Hi . I need some advice . Did you just walk across the hall like that ? No . Actually . I put my bra on when I got to the door . ' cause I know how my girly parts embarrass you . I can handle it . I watch " Animal Planet . " Okay . So do I go ... smarty turtleneck . hmm ? Or ... bold ... cleavage blouse ? - Well . they 're both fine . - Fine ? I do n't know . Whichever one you like better . What ? ! Will . what is the point of having a gay best friend . if you 're not gon na dress me ? What 's wrong with you ? It 's just this whole Subway Tush thing . I did n't even want to get involved in the first place . as you may recall . I was trying to be a good friend . so I went to all the trouble of setting up all these meetings with these investors . and the whole thing blows up in my face . I just -- Jack sold me out . I 'll tell you that . Will . I-- I think he 's more than made it up to you . - What ? How ? - He 's resigning . - He 's what ? ! - Yeah . I spoke to him this morning . but I was missing all these pantyhose . and I thought he might 've taken them . I was wrong . But anyway . that 's - - that 's what he told me . He 's resigning ? I do n't - - why would he do that ? He said because he loves you and he 's your friend and he does n't wan na do it without you . In fact . I think he 's doing it right now . Oh . my God . I - - he - - he ca n't do that . I love that he wants to . but ... his Tush means everything to him . - I ca n't let this happen . - Wait a minute . Wait . wait ! Hey . hey ! - What about me ? - Oh ... this with this . change the lipstick . hair up and ... here are your hose . So without Will . you guys do n't get Jack . - In conclusion . gentlemen . I resign . You stole this idea . Look . when you say it like that . of course it 's gon na sound bad . You told us you had a patent on this product . when in fact . the idea of the Subway Tush belongs to a Mr . Bjorn Stevenson . Hey . he said he was moving back to Sweden . Then again . he also said he could bench-press my weight . which led to a very painful breakup . I do n't think you understand . We 're seriously considering legal action . I know you are . but what am I ? Gentlemen . please stop . Hey ! I know what 's going on here and I 'm not gon na let it happen . I urge you . do not to accept this man 's resignation . - He 's only doing it out of love for me . - Will -- No . do n't . Please . Jack . let me say this . - Will . Iisten -- - Jack has ... passion . He has vision and most of all Jack has originality . There is not an idea in this man 's head that is not fresh . unique -- - Shut up . Will . I stole the idea . - What ? Apparently . the Subway Tush is not his idea . It belongs to what I 've ascertained is an ex-lover of Swedish extraction .

And please enjoy that high-vitamin astronaut drink ... you 're sucking down . There 's no gravity in space , Mr . Matthews . Therefore , astronauts suck up . Learn from them . He 's a teacher , man . Keep raggin ' on him ... he 's gon na make your whole sixth-grade year miserable . I 'm gon na be miserable anyhow . At least this way , I 'm taking him with me . Hey , who 's that ?  I think she 's new . She must be new . She 's talking to Feeny . OK , so how late did you stay up last night ? Monologue . Monologue , first guest ... bad sketch , funny zoo animal ... Steve Lawrence . Whoa ! Steve Lawrence !  And there 's the bell . 4 hours till lunch .  She 's dead , Mr . Bornihay . Pick up the knife ... and kill yourself . Come on , Mr . Feeny ... you and I both know she 's not really dead . May I please stab her a few times ... just to make sure ? Hey , you touch me with that knife ... you better kill me the first time . Mr . Feeny ... All right , all right . Cory . Huh ? What 's the score ? Bottom of the third , 2 outs . Dykstra 's on second , Kruk 's on first ... 3 and 2 to Daulton . What 's this , Mr . Matthews ? Huh ? W-what did you say , Mr . Feeny ? You took my hearing aid . Smoltz delivers , Daulton swings . Oh , he got a piece of that one ... climbs up the wall , and ... ohh ! Mr . Matthews , Romeo and juliet ... is Shakespeare 's ultimate testament of love ... between a man and a woman . BOY : help ! help . Mr . Feeny ! help ! Help ! Help ! Miss Kincaid , thank you . Thank you ... for that , uh ... vigorous interpretation . Mr . Matthews , you do not listen to the ballgame ... in the middle of my class . Mr . Feeny , who cares about some guy ... who killed himself over some dumb girl ? The tragedy here , Mr . Matthews ... is not about a dumb girl ... or the boy who kills himself because of her . It 's about the all-consuming power of love ... and the inevitability of its influence ... on each of our lives . Are you aware that I 'm only 11 years old ? Are you aware that you have detention Friday afternoon ? No , actually , I did not know that . ok . Bye . Yes ! Yes ! Phillies won , 8-3 . I 'm going out with Heather Ralston ! You know what that means ? It means every guy in the 10th grade wants to be me . It means if they win Friday night ... they 're in the playoffs . Look , Cory , we got to talk about something . That makes the game we 're going to ... the most important game of the year ! Look , Cory , my date with Heather 's Friday . Now , look , I got a slight case ... of detention from Feeny ... but I 'll just meet you at the bus . What ? ! It 's the only night she was available . You 're not going to the game ? That 's terrible . Actually , Cory , it , uh ... it gets worse . She 's going to the game with us . You 're really close ... like our special thing . Cory , I 'm trying to get ... a special thing going with Heather . Now , look , you could be happy for me ... and accept this like a mature guy ... - or you can ... - Dad ! Overreact . Dad ! Just the kid I want to see . Mom , we have a major problem . You have detention with Mr . Feeny . How could you possibly know that ? He stuck his head over the fence and told me ... while I was bringing in the groceries . I Want to move . Why did you get detention ? You know , you 're missing the bigger issue , Dad . You bought a house next to my teacher . I Want to move . I Want to move now . Get the guy with the gold jacket . I 'll be in the car . Why did you get detention ? Apparently , he 'd rather listen to the baseball game ... on the radio ... Mom , I 'm a kid . I do n't understand the emotional content ... of full House . I do . cory : Besides , I do n't know why you 're dumping on me . I 'm not the one who sold out my only brother ... for some girl . Eric , she said yes ! - Yup . - Congratulations ! You were in on this ? Come on , Cory , do n't you think you 're making ... a big deal about this game ? I do n't care about the game . I do n't care about the tickets . I would n't take them if you offered them to me . All right , look , I 'll just take Heather somewhere else . Here , you want the tickets ? - Yeah ! - Get real ! Dad ! Cory , he paid for those tickets with his own money . He can take whoever he likes . But I earned those tickets . I slept with him for 11 years !.. because girls will be important to you , too . Fine . My brother betrays me ... my parents take his side . Fine . I do n't have a friend in this house . Do you want me and Debbie ... to go to the baseball game with you ? Hey , go to the game with my sister and her doll . Great . Maybe during the seventh-inning stretch ... I could run through the stadium ... in my old Spider-Man underwear . Well , you do n't have to dress up for me . Well , mine 's got fuzz . Mine 's got lips . Hey , bagman ... rough life being an only child , huh ? Yeah . Rougher life being an orphan ... which is what I am as of last night . What happened ? I dumped my family , and my family dumped me . It Was mutual . They 're keeping the house . Well , we 're here for you , Cory . Thanks . You 're my new brothers . It is . So we go down early . There 's always guys with extra tickets . Do n't you have detention Friday ? Ah , do n't worry about detention . I can handle Feeny . Feeny loves me . Feeny hates you . Well , it 's one of the two . We 'll see who 's right . Mr . Feeny , may I sit down ? I 'd rather you did n't . Hates me . Mr . Matthews , I spend 35 to 40 hours a week ... dealing with the perceived problems ... of whiny little people like yourself . Now , this is my lunch period , my respite from the fray . I spend 4 hours with you every morning ... and 3 hours with you every afternoon . Now , for God 's sake , get out of my face . Evelyn . George . I saved a place for you . Oh , are n't you sweet ?  And who is this young man ? Uh , my name 's Cory Matthews . Mr . Feeny does n't hate you .  Oh , good . Caught you home . Housewarming gift . Chocolate pie ... with a side of barbecued chicken and corn on the cob . Now , I would 've bought you a plant ... but , hey , you 're in a tree . Thanks , Mom . Are you all right ? Of course I 'm all right . I 've been in this tree house a million times . Never after dark . Wa ha ha ha ! MORGAN : Cory ! I got to put a moat around this place . Do you want Debbie to keep you company ? Why would I want your doll to keep me company ? In case you get scared . Morgan , I 'm 11 years old . I do n't get scared . And even if I did get scared ... and had to defend myself , my weapon of choice ... would not be a chick with a plastic head . Mom , it 's me . How do I know it 's you ? Who else would want my underwear ? Good point . Now , do n't get your hopes up . I 'm not moving back in or anything . Oh , hey , I 'm just here straightening up the room ... for the boy we rented it out to . Well , I hope he 's got better luck with brothers ... than I did . You still feeling a little abandoned , Core ? Yeah , well , life goes on . Yeah , that 's what your dad said ... when it happened to him . Why ? Who abandoned Dad ? You did . I never did anything like this to Dad . Oh , when you were little ... you could n't wait for your dad to get home from work ... so you could throw the football around with him . I 'll tell you something ... he looked forward to it ..... you got a little older ... and you had a bunch of friends ... and you were more interested ... in throwing the football around with them . Wait a minute . It sounds like you 're saying I 'm the bad guy . No , honey , there 's no bad guy . All I 'm saying is that it 's natural ... that people grow up and priorities change . ok ? - Mom . - Hmm ? You were always cordial to me when I lived here . Thank you , Cory . And I give you my word ... that the new boy will never replace you ... in our hearts .  You 're not gon na talk to me at all ... are you , Mr . Feeny ? Because I 've been sitting in this seat for 38 minutes ... and I 've been very good ... and I think you should let me go . Look , an 11-year-old boy ... can not sit still this long . I 'm going to get up . The door is open . Fine . I 'm in the hall ! Mr . Feeny , this stinks . It 's supposed to stink , Mr . Matthews . It 's detention . You 're being detained ... from whatever it is you 'd rather be doing . Well , I think it 's a cruel ... and unusual life-sucking torture . You 've captured the essence . Why do we have to stay here ? Just because ... I do n't want to hear about this love stuff ? Because I know it only leads to no good ... and I know in your heart you agree with me . What brings you to that conclusion , Mr . Matthews ? ' Cause you and I had dinner together last night . Really ? I was n't aware . I had chocolate pie ... and you had salad for two all by yourself . How did you know that ? ' Cause I slept in my tree house last night . You know why ? ' Cause this love stuff ..... how it 's worth killing yourself for ... when I know you do n't really believe that ... do you ? Well ... You shrewd little observer of the human condition . How blissful it must be for you ... to have lived so little ... and yet already reached your conclusions ... about the greatest wonder of the universe . Y-you know what , Mr . Feeny ? Keep the radio . Shakespeare wrote plays and sonnets . The Greeks wrote tragedies and comedies . Robert Burns , Emily Dickinson ... the Brownings examined the depths of human emotions . And do you know what each one of these ... poets , playwrights , and philosophers ... had in common , Mr . Matthews ? They all took your class ? Every one of them was older than 11 . You come into my classroom ... at the beginning of the year ... and at the end , you go . And I really do n't know ... if in the time we spent together ... I have taught you anything . Do I have your attention ? Yes , sir . I live on the other side of the fence from you , Cory ... and it 's impossible not to face ... in your direction every once in a while ... and notice the people in the next yard . And through the years , I 've got to know them . It is apparent that they are fine individuals ... but ... their real strength comes from being a family . And do you know why they 're a family , Cory ? Because at one time ... a man and a woman realized that they loved each other ... and pursued the unlimited potential ... of what may come from that love . And here you are . There is no greater aspiration ... than to have love in our lives , Mr . Matthews . Romeo knew it and died for it . Others know it and ... prepare salads . And those who do n't know it ... will sit in detention ... for the rest of their lives . Morgan ... I do n't want anybody to know I 'm here , ok ? Oh , ok . You 're moving back in ? Yeah . Do n't tell anybody . Oh , ok . Cory 's back ! No ! Shh ! Hi , honey . I 'm home . Well , it 's about time . Dinner 's on the table ... and the kids have been animals . Ha ha ! I know that you and Mom will lose out ... on all that rental income ... but I want my old room back . Well , that comes as quite an economic blow ... but we 'll try to get by . Dad , I 'm sorry I dumped you for my friends . When did you do that ? You know . All the time . Well , Cory , I 'm glad that you have friends ... and I 'm glad you 're back . - No , do n't hug me ! - No , do n't hug me ! Die ! Die ! Die ! Die ! There 's one We Wo n't have to neuter . 5 to 3 . Phillies are in the playoffs . Yeah , I heard . What do you mean you heard ? You were there . I really was n't paying much attention to the game , Cory . Why not ? It was a great game . It was not , however , a great date . You had a bad date ? No , I had a great date . Heather Was beautiful . She knew what to say , she knew what to do . Unfortunately , her date spilled food ... tripped over chairs , and had nothing interesting ... to say for nine innings . Eric , you 're much too cool for some girl . News flash . I 'm not cool . You do n't know what you 're talking about . OK , you 're not cool . And now you know better ... than to go to a game without your brother . You 're right . I am ? Yeah . Good .  You do n't mean that . Yes , I do . Here . What 's this ? Call her . - Who ? - Who ? ! Heather , my nemesis ! - Call her . - Why ? ' Cause you 're sitting there drooling and pathetic ... and I know somewhere inside 's my cool brother ... and I 'm not gon na get him back unless you call her . Look , I 'm not calling her . I sat there all night and did n't say anything . What could I say now ? Take her to a movie . There you 're supposed to sit and not say anything . A movie 's perfect for your current skill level . Why do you want me to call her ? I 'm told love is Worth it . Are n't you going to invite me ... to have tea with you ? Morgan , I want you to know something . No matter how old I get ..... get interested in girls ... Milk ? And it seems like I do n't care ... about you anymore ... Ketchup ? I still always want you ... to invite me to have tea with you . Morgan , honey , put your tea set away ... and brush your teeth . It 's time to go to bed . Do I have to ? You 're asking me ? How about if we just stay up ... and finish our tea ? You volunteering to put your sister to bed ? Yeah , I guess I am . Why ? ' Cause I do n't understand anything ... about my entire life . Yeah , thanks . Two days in a row . She just does n't learn . Evelyn , I hope I 'm not being forward ... but instead of cafeteria lunch ... maybe one evening we could have dinner together ? Of course , George . I 'd love it . Good . I 'm quite the cook , you know ? Really ? Oh , yes ... had to cancel at the last moment . Confused , Mr . Matthews ? Yes , I am , sir . As it should be . 
@@5242741 Hello . Hello ! Anybody here ? MacGyver ! Dent . Yeah . Nobody answered the door . That 's because nobody was home . I got to talk to you . Right away . Really ? I need you to help me get in shape . I 'm gon na box again . Box ? Yeah . I was the number five ranked heavyweight in the world before they sent me up to Folsom . Get out of here . Yep , and I was heavyweight champ in the joint , too . And you know how tough some of those guys are . Earl , you 've definitely come to the wrong place . I hate boxing . I think it 's barbaric . Some people say the same things about hockey . Yeah , well , I happen to have hope for hockey . MacGyver , all I 'm asking is for you to help me get in shape . You ate everything . It 's all gone . I 'm a heavyweight . Heavyweights eat . Earl , look , I 've been gone a week , I 'm tired , I 'm hungry . Is n't there somebody else ? There 's nobody else . Besides , there 's somebody I 'd like you to meet . Come on . Okay ? Please . Okay . Hey , Earl . You know her ? My daughter . Uh , Veronica . This is a friend of mine , MacGyver . Hi , Veronica . The name 's Ronnie . I changed it . How could you change it ? My mother 's name was Veronica . So ? I never met her . Besides , Ronnie gets more respect . It 's not so fancy . - Listen , Veronica ... - Ronnie ! Okay , Ronnie . MacGyver and I got to go inside . We 'll be right back . Whatever . Unruly behavior , lying , cheating , stealing . It 's quite a file for a 14-year-old . But not all that surprising . What she needs , Mr . Dent , is a stable environment . But then you brought Mr . MacGyver along to support the idea that you can provide that , did n't you ? In spite of your unfortunate past . Tell her , MacGyver . Well , I do know that Mr . Dent is sincere in his effort to change his life . And you are willing to provide a roof over their heads until Mr . Dent proves himself financially secure ? See ? I told you , he was some kind of a guy . Well , this is n't going to be easy . Both of you are almost strangers to her . And Veronica has learned not to trust very many people . She 's my kid . I love her . That 's got ta count for somethin ' . How do you plan on providing for her ? Fighting . You know , boxing . A boxer ? You call that a stable profession ? Why , you do n't ... I made good money . Well , it 's also hardly the healthiest environment for a 14-year-old girl . It 's what I do . You shuffle papers . I box . I mean , I got this match all lined up . And with the purse , I 'll be able to provide a great environment . Uh-huh . I guess you 're just going to have to show me . Oh , we will . You see , MacGyver 's going to be my trainer . You are a good friend , Mr . MacGyver . Thanks . I prefer to see children remain with their natural parents whenever possible . But if you do n't show me that you can provide a suitable environment for Veronica , I will recommend that her current foster parents get permanent custody . 25 grand , MacGyver . One fight , and I got a bodacious bank account and my daughter . Earl , I did not agree to help you train . MacGyver , I 'm desperate . You heard her . So why do n't you train at a gym like a normal human being ? Well , uh ... What ? What 'd you do ? - I sort of burned some bridges . - I 'm shocked . I mean , a lot of guys , uh , ai n't so glad to see me anymore . What ... What are you doing ? Following in your footsteps . You want a freebie ? Veronica , that 's wrong . Right , sure , you 're the expert . And it 's Ronnie , okay ? Okay . Okay . Look at this face . Is she a chip off the old block or what ? Huh ? I guess it 's gon na take a while , huh ? We 'd better get started , bud . Veronica ? Ronnie ! Come on , okay , okay , Ronnie . Wait up . So , I guess this will be the training room . Sure got a lot of junk . Thanks . I 'm a pack rat . You serious about turning this place into a gym ? Yeah , why not ? Just give me a little time , okay ? Okay , you got it . Come on , Ronnie , how about we go pick up some grub at the market while MacGyver gets set up . Whatever . Go for it , Earl ! He 's up and deep ! Oh , we got it . Hey , nice catch . Hey , watch it , jerk ! Sorry . Just touched it . Any scratches , you pay , pal ! I told you , I barely touched it . It 's a brand new car ! Oh , nice move , Earl . Hey , you better thank him for saving your car . What ? Are you two looking for trouble ? Come on . Ignore him . Let 's go . Hey , come on back here , I 'm not done with you ! You 're lucky I 'm a nice guy ! You could have taken him easy . So ? I lifted them . What 's the matter with you ? I thought I told you to cool it . You want me to be perfect like you , huh ? I did n't say that . So like how come all of a sudden you want custody of me , anyway ? You 're my kid . I wan na be with you . I 've been your kid for 14 years . Not that you ever noticed . Hey , come on , give me a break , okay ? You had a lousy time and it was my fault . I admit it . - So what do you want ? - What do you want ? A chance to make up for it . Yeah , right . Hey , where you goin ' ? To pay for those wrestling cards , so my kid does n't end up in a six foot cell like her old man did , huh ? Wow , what is that ? Uh , well , I 'll show you . Keep the liquid up and climbing . You got to be kidding . Uh-uh . You , young lady , you 're gon na keep track of your dad 's progress on that board , all right ? Cool ! Weak . What 's this ? Uh , well , for lack of a better name for it , we 'll call it a punching machine . Watch . Huh ? MacGyver , I 'm fighting Crazy Eddie Jackson , not an octopus . Oh , come on , you got to give it a try . Obviously it takes two . You 're the controller . Me ? Yeah , you . You did a pretty good job with that candy machine , I figured you could handle this . Look , it 's real simple . You got on-off switches for top , middle , and bottom . Go ahead . Boy , am I gon na work his butt off . Uh , what kind of contraption do you have to work out the legs ? A jump rope ... Oh , a sucker punch , huh ? Oops , sorry . Listen , speed it up , kid . Ah ... I 've got it right . Bam ! Hello , Earl . Nice gym . For what , I do n't know , but nice . What do you want ? This your kid ? Sure she is . Your old man could have been the champ , kid . Thing is , he did n't have the brains to listen to me . Dumb . Real dumb . Ronnie , go upstairs . Help MacGyver put away the groceries . MacGyver said I should stay here with you . I said go upstairs ! All right ! We 're here to check on our investment . Got a lot riding on you . Remember the deal ? Dive in eight . Oh , yeah ? You better believe it . Earl ? Yeah . Oh , uh , this is my old manager , Bart Riggins and his , uh , assistant , uh , Bailey . They 're here to wish me luck . You know , the fight . I trained him for five years . Put a lot of bread in him . Do n't disappoint me . Where 's Ronnie ? She 's upstairs . I told her to help you out . - She 's not there . - What ? - Oh , no , she ca n't be . Not again ! - What ? The last time she was gone for six months . I 'm gon na lose her for sure ! All right , settle down . Um , grab the jeep , I 'll get the bike . I know how you feel , Ronnie . Leave me alone . I ran away from home one time . When my grandpa told me to get lost . Or why . Oh , and now you do , right ? That 's right . He was trying to protect me . Just like your dad 's trying to protect you . From who ? Well , I do n't know . Maybe from himself . You know , he has n't had a lot of practice in raising a kid . You got to give him a little time . I do n't know . He 's always on my case . Well , he 's supposed to . That 's what dads do . Where you been ? Running away . Just like you 're always doin ' . You and your fight . You know something ? I think you 're all wind . I do n't think there is a fight . - Earl ... - There is a fight ! When I tell you something , that 's it ! I do n't lie . Oh yeah ? Prove it . - All right , that 's enough . - No ! There you go . Crazy Eddie Jackson versus yours truly . This proof enough for you ? Okay , I was wrong . Hey , at least you know now that your old man 's word is worth something . Rocketman ? Yeah . That 's what they used to call me . Short fuse . Lots of power . Get it ? Got it . You 're not the main event here . Hey , I 've been away , remember ? Hey , you have a good time on me , my man , huh ? Wow ! It 's Herman the German . - Who ? - Hey , Herman , I hear a rumor you matched Mad Mike and Wretched Rodney . Ai n't no rumor , kid . Here , take a friend , huh ? Wow . He 's only the greatest wrestler ever . Oh come on , Ronnie , all the wrestling stuff is fake . No , it 's not , it 's great . Let 's go inside . Ooo-wee ! What stinks around here ? There it is . There it is . Old meat , past its prime . Hello , Stinson . I do n't want you around here I do n't want my fighter to see you . - There 'll be trouble . I 'm just showing - my kid the gym . Well , I 'll just show you and the kid the door . Hey , Dent ? Spend much time with your kid the last five years ? I 'm warning you , Eddie . You do n't want to start talking like that . Hey , what you worried about ? If your kid is as dumb as her old man , she wo n't even understand it . Oh yeah ? That 's what you think , wise guy . She 's smarter than both of us put together , Eddie . And if you ever put her down again , I 'll tear you apart . How about now , Dent ? Right now , come on up here . All right , you 're on . No , Dent , no ! Somebody call the cops , somebody call the paper , somebody call somebody ! Oh , they 're fighting for free ! I ca n't stand it ! No , Dent , aw ! Look at these two ... I knew it , I knew it ! Oh , come on , you guys , what are you doing ? No , no , no , no . Do n't , no ... Come on . Hey , hey , hey , what do you think this is , the Golden Gloves ? You 're prize fighters that fight . Get out of here . Dent , get out of here . - Come on ! - Eddie , Eddie , shut up . Dent , get out of here , get out of here . Okay , Eddie , come on , come on , get back to your work out now ! - Come on ! Move it ! Move it !.. My nose . Come on , come on , come on , way to go , way to go , Eddie . Looking good . - Is it broke ? - Leave me alone . After you , Rocketman . Oh . I 'm sorry I thought there was n't any fight , Earl . Ah , forget it . You better get some sleep , kid . We got a lot to do tomorrow . You really want me around , huh ? Hey , come on . Who 's gon na work those crazy machines MacGyver dreamed up ? Oh yeah , that 's right . ' Night . What are you doing ? Oh , this stuff 's for your corner . Ooh . It 's cold . Yeah . Sodium thiosulphate . It 's a photographic fixer . Just add water , instant cold pack . Oh , I get it . To handle the cuts . So you just chill this iro ? Press it to the cut , and , presto , stops the bleeding . What 's the matter with you ? Crazy Eddie gets $4000 for the fight , and you get $25,000 ? You want to explain that to me ? You heard the lady . I have three weeks to come up with enough to provide for Ronnie or I lose her . Forever . Maybe that 's just as well if this is where you 're coming from . What is that supposed to mean ? Figure it out . You 're all over Ronnie for stealing candy bars , and you 're about to throw a fight . Just this once , so I get custody . Then I 'm giving it up . And you do n't think Ronnie 's gon na know ? She 's got eyes , Earl . She 'll see right through you . Now come on . She does n't need a buddy or a pal . She needs a father to teach her right from wrong . Even if it hurts . Yeah . $5,000 on Dent at one to five ? Take it . I just took $20,000 on Crazy Eddie at five to one . Lay it off . Out of town . ... inside the final , 16th of a mile . He 's drawing away from the wheel . Are you kidding ? Dent 's one to five . He almost murdered Crazy Eddie when they fought in prison . I have to talk to you . $25,000 . No renegotiating . I do n't want your cash . What ? The fix is off . Over . Done . Says who ? If you 're copping out , Dent , forget it . You 're in too deep . You ca n't threaten me , Riggins . Not when my kid 's future 's on the line . Your kid ? If you do n't come through , your kid 's an orphan . For the first time in my life , I do n't care about me . My mind 's made up . It 's off . See you at the fight . You want I should bust him up ? You moron , he 's got a fight ! If you want to control a man , control what he cares about the most . No , I 'll tell you what I want , Bailey . I want Dent 's daughter . You should have seen the look on the faces of those sharks when I told them I was n't gon na throw the fight . And you still think boxing 's a sport , huh ? Well , maybe I should pull out , huh ? I mean , the $4,000 I 'm making is n't gon na provide diddly for Ronnie . Well , it 's a start . You can still get a job , you know . Maybe get the commission to delay a decision . The truth is Ronnie does n't need me nearly as much as I need her . Hi . Where you been ? L ... I was just worried . But I should have known my daughter would have made the right decision . I am so proud of you . - So ... - Hey ! - You still need a trainer ? - You bet . - How about the heavy bag ? - Okay . Get over there while I knock the stuffings out of it . Okay , Earl . Hold it real tight . Give it all you got . Go , go , go , go , go , go go , go , go , go , go ! You 've done good , Earl , you 've done good . - So did you , MacGyver . - Yeah . Your gizmos paid off in more ways than one . Thanks . You bet . Uh , I 'll get it set up , okay ? - 6:30 for you ? - You got it . All right . Get out of here . You are not seeing the big picture . Hey , let go of me ! Hey , Riggins ... I 'm not in the business of hurting people , Earl . But I do want to look after my interests . Now we have a deal . You go down in eight . They want you to throw the fight ? Smart kid . Do n't do it , Dad . I said I would at first , because we need the money . You did it to get me ? You must really want me . More than anything , kid . The last few days have been the best of my life . No matter how things work out , I want you to know that . Same here , Earl . That 's enough . I 'm gon na cry . And do n't give them any lift . Just do as they say . That goes for you , too , Dent . Hey , I do n't see Ronnie . An outstanding match between two former Folsom Prison heavyweight champions . In this corner , wearing white trunks , Crazy Eddie Jackson ! And in black trunks , the former fifth ranked heavyweight of the world , Earl Rocketman Dent . Earl , I still do n't see her . Do n't worry about her . Let 's just get this over with . Let 's go , Earl , come on . Okay , Earl , Eddie , I gave you instructions in the dressing room . Let 's have a good clean fight . Let 's go out now . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , this is Jim Lampley at ringside . Tonight 's eight rounds , - semi-main event between these two ... - Hey , kid ! Sit tight . ... former prison heavyweight champions promises to be a bruising battle . The referee has completed his instructions , so hang on to your seats as here we go . Now remember , in their one previous bout , - Earl Rocketman Dent ... ... and the odds favor him ... - Bailey , move over . ... to repeat that victory here tonight . And there 's the bell . The two men now move to the center of the ring and begin to circle cautiously . Crazy Eddie moves in quickly and tries to establish the left jab . - Jab , jab . And Crazy Eddie Jackson ... - Too low . The body . Go for the ribs ! Go for the ribs ! ... the right hand . Dent is forced to back pedal as all the action early is dominated by Jackson . Two right crosses and Dent is rocked backward by the a left and a right and Jackson is driven back into the ropes . A momentary advantage for Dent . But he did n't press it . He lets Jackson come back at him . And now coming off of the ropes ... Okay , get off there . Let him go , Earl , let him go , Earl . What a round so far . There 's the bell . The end of round one . What a brilliant round for Crazy Eddie Jackson . All right , Earl . Where 's Ronnie ? Just stay out of it . They 've got her . Just leave me alone and let me do what I got to do . Where 'd they take her , Earl ? I do n't know . Well , where 'd you find them ? The machine shop across the street . That 's where Riggins runs his book . All right , Earl , hang in there . You might not have to throw this . ... and Earl Rocketman Dent was clearly overshadowed by Crazy Eddie Jackson . Thanks mostly to superior body punching . Sounds like our boy got smart . And here we go , round six . Check on the girl . See how she 's doing . Both fighters move out , probing , with jabs . Crazy Eddie , keeping Dent at a distance . Two jabs from Crazy Eddie . Then two quick rights to the head . Another right by Jackson , and another . And again , it is Jackson taking control of the action in the sixth . She 's doing better than her old man . It is all Crazy Eddie Jackson , right now . Hey , look at that guy , no guts ! Hold on . When I tell you to break , break . And now it is Jackson who is controlling all the action . And what a surprise . Dent , what a shell of the man who had won 27 of 38 previous bouts by knockout . Crazy Eddie smiles as the referee breaks them apart . Believe me , there is no love lost between these two fighters , in or out of the ring . Now Crazy Eddie ... Dent replies with a left and a right . Dent missing now , with a wild roundhouse right . Wild action . And Dent a little bit off-kilter ... There 's no snap in that punch . Dent leans forward ... And there 's the bell . The end of round six . We 'll be back for the seventh round ... Psst . Hey , could you turn the radio up a little ? Here we go now for round seven of a very close fight . And once again , as the seventh begins , Crazy Eddie forces the initiative . The Rocketman backs off , weaving and bobbing , trying to stay away from Crazy Eddie 's hands . Oh , Crazy Eddie with a right cross ! And a left . And another right . What a combination ! Dent is in the biggest trouble in the fight . Crazy Eddie moving in , all too aware of Dent 's massive rocket punch that floored him for the count in their previous bout . No question the Rocketman is more dangerous than with an uppercut . Dent backpedaling . Crazy Eddie all over him ... Dent dances with the right hand . And now he hangs on . The referee separates the two fighters and Dent backs away inexplicably . Crazy Eddie with a combination to the body , and follows up with an uppercut . Dent with a feeble right , but now Crazy Eddie two more lefts , and Dent is backed up against the ropes again . - Rocketman Dent ... - Do you hear something ? ... too tired to press any advantage ... - Take a look . ... even at those moments when he seems in control ... - In a minute . Round seven moving toward a close now . And Crazy Eddie swings away freely with both hands , trying to land the one punch that will settle matters once and for all . You okay ? I 'm fine . What about Earl ? It is Dent backing up Crazy Eddie with a right and a left and lands a right hand ... What 's the matter , Earl , you got no guts ? ... having pummeled Dent against the ropes . Well , I 'll tell you , with seven rounds in the books ... She 's getting away ! Well , stop her ! Rocketman Dent , who was once the number five heavyweight in the world ... Here we go now . Round number eight . Crazy Eddie Jackson , always cool and moving toward the center of the ring , a very tired Earl Rocketman Dent ... Come on ! Come on , get out of my way ! I 'm stuck ! ... knocks Dent against the ropes ... And a right and a left and Dent is down ! Way to do it , Eddie ! - One , two ... - Earl , do n't do it ! ... three ... Get up Earl , get up ! Come on , you can do it . I 'm okay . ... five ... - I 'm okay . ... six ... - I 'm okay . Come on Earl , I know you can do it . ... seven , eight , nine ... Come on Earl , go for it . - Are you all right ? - Yes and do n't you try to stop me ! Okay , let 's go . Yes , go for it ! ... as he moves forward and lands a left and a right . This is wildly with a left and another right hand and another . And Jackson is driven into a corner and suddenly helpless against the onslaught . Way to go , Rocketman ! Ha ! You see ? Just moments ago Dent appeared on the verge of being knocked out . Now suddenly we see he 's mounted a big comeback . ... Jackson reeling in the center of the ring . Now Rocketman winds up with a bolo punch . And down goes Jackson . Yes ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven Jackson saved by the bell ! Saved by the bell in round number eight , and what a wild finish ! You did it , Earl . You won . I owe it all to my little trainer here . Ladies and gentlemen ! We have a unanimous decision . You won ! The winner , Crazy Eddie Jackson ! No way , we were robbed ! Hey Ronnie , all that matters is that you 're safe . You were great . Think so ? I love you , Dad . Dad ? Is she some kid or what ? Oh , it 's not so bad . He hardly touched you . Yeah . For a freight train , he was a real pushover . You know , Earl , I 've been thinking . We do n't need a house . An apartment will be just fine . Look , Ronnie , the money I ended up with , no way is that gon na satisfy that lady down there at the Children 's Services . Maybe you 'd be better off with your foster parents after all . Oh , no way . I 'm not leaving . We 'll move to another state . Hey , Earl , big guy . Got somebody who wants to talk to you here . Hey , Dent , great fight . You 've got a lot of class , a lot of style . The kind of man I 'd like to manage . Uh , sorry . I quit boxing . Boxing ? Who said boxing ? I 'm talking about wrestling . Hey , the way you worked the crowd . Magic . Pure show biz . Listen , I 've got a $30,000 advance against a guarantee of ... He 'll do it , he 'll take it ! Rocketman , we 'll get you a great costume . I do n't know . MacGyver ? Well , a good athlete always listens to his trainer . Yeah , I guess he does . I think we could work something out here . All right !

By the time they get here , it 'll be too late . It may already be too late . Do n't do this . That 's an order ! Lieutenant Harper ! Shoot me if you want , Captain , but I 'm not waiting around so I can wind up like the others . Got ta go . Throw up the line . Cast off ! Hit me . - It looks like she 's just drifting'out there . - Mm . We 're headin ' for her . This is the Lisette , Canadian fishing vessel CV233 . Please identify . This is the Lisette . Come in , please . Cut the engines and meet me up on deck . Hello , out there ! Hey ! We 're throwin ' ya a line ! Grab it ; we 'll pull ya in ! What was so urgent that you could n't tell me over the phone ? I did n't want to waste any time . A Navy destroyer escort , the U.S.S . Ardent , has been missing in the North Atlantic for the past 42 hours . - Missing ? - No radio contact and no distress signals picked up . Search planes and satellites have n't picked up anything either . You 're saying that a ship and its entire crew just vanished ? Well , that 's what it looked like until last night . A Canadian trawler picked up 18 survivors . - Well , they must have reported what happened . - Only one is still alive . He 's been taken into the I.C.U . Under heavy security . - What was wrong with him ? - That 's what I was hoping you could tell me . They wo n't let me in to see him , but because of your medical background , I was able to get you a clearance code . I want your opinion on this ... - Meet me back at my office when you 're finished . Thank you . Excuse me . Is this Lieutenant Richard Harper ? That 's what his wristband says . And he 's been positively identified ? All military personnel are fingerprinted . Those records were cross-checked . Then I think there 's been some kind of a mistake here . According to this report , Lieutenant Harper is 28 years old . Why has n't a systemic workup been ordered on this patient ? I was n't aware that my diagnostic decisions required your approval . I 'm the physician in charge of this patient . Let me see your clearance . Can you tell me what 's going on here ? How can you explain what happened to this man ? This clearance code is invalid . Where 'd you get this ? Who are you ? I am a medical doctor , and I would like to see the autopsy reports on the victims . I have n't got time for this . Did they let you in to see Lieutenant Harper ? Yeah , I saw somebody , but whether it was actually the lieutenant ... - What do you mean ? - He looked about 90 years old . Off by about half a century . You do n't seem too surprised . I wan na show you something . This was the course of Ardent when she disappeared . Now , I 've been tracking the points of departure and destination ... for each of these " X " files . On December 12 , 1949 , a Royal Navy battleship ... disappeared between Leeds and Cape Perry . The sea was calm , the weather , sunny . In 1963 , at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis , a fleet of Soviet minesweepers left from here for Havana . All six vessels vanished without a trace . All in all , I 've counted nine unexplained disappearances . Each of them passed through here , the 65th parallel . - Another Bermuda Triangle ? - It 's more like a wrinkle in time ... But then the Manhattan Project heated up , and it was discontinued . And most of the scientists were relocated to Los Alamos . - Except none of those scientists made it to Los Alamos . - Where were they sent ? Roswell , New Mexico . Are you suggesting the Philadelphia Experiment used alien technology ? Less than nine months after the alleged crash of a UFO in Roswell , the U.S.S . Eldridge did more than just hide from radar screens . It disappeared altogether from the Philadelphia Navy Yard only to reappear minutes later , hundreds of miles away , in Norfolk , Virginia . That 's not possible , Mulder , not without defying all laws of time and space . Those physicists may have been trying to manipulate wormholes on Earth . - Wormholes ? - Actual portals where matter interfaces with time ... at a relatively decelerated or accelerated rate . - I 'm booked on an 8:30 flight to Norway . - Have you let Skinner in ? No . I 'm giving myself a 24-hour head start before I give Skinner my report . I want this one myself . I 'm going with you . If that really was Lieutenant Harper , I wan na know what happened to him . 0 for 5 . What is it , Mulder ? Why are they so afraid ? My father spent the better part of his life at sea . He had a healthy respect for the ocean , but he never feared it . - I see fear in these men 's eyes . - Bruntdland could n't have taken you out there anyway . A ship has to be classified ice-class ... before it can even go past the Lofoten Basin . My name is Trondheim , Henry Trondheim . The ship you want is the Zeal , a 50-ton trawler with a double hull . I ran a charter business there . I got fed up with tourists . How do you feel about the sea north of Beerenberg ? - This time of year , it 'd be ten hours minimum each way . - So you 've been there ? A few times . A few times I got some of my best hauls out of there . - Why is everyone else so afraid to go there ? - Well , legends . - They grow up on stories . - What stories ? A huge stone came out of the sky , crashed into the pack ice . - A meteorite . - An evil god . They worship it by stayin'away . So , exactly what is it that you 're lookin ' for up there ? A number of things . - How good are you ? - About as good as you 're going to get considering ... no one else will take you there . - What ? - Sea legs . It 's been about 12 hours . You said it was gon na take 10 . What 's going on ? I told you before . The visibility is lousy . I 've never seen it this thick . - How much longer till we get there ? - We 're right where you wan na be . I even think we 've got what you 're lookin ' for . - One minute it 's right in front of us . The next , it 's not . Like something 's messing with my radar and my navigation system . - I ca n't explain it ... - Captain ! We 're gon na hit ! Halvorsen , check the hull for damage . I do n't get it . This is what you 're lookin ' for ? It 's the U.S.S . Ardent . It 's a destroyer escort . All right . What do you want with it , anyway ? It 's a ghost ship . Look at all this corrosion . Hey , Scully . Let 's check the crew quarters first . Mulder . They almost look mummified . Like they 've been dead a very long time . Except for this strange residue . What was that ? - An engine . - My ship ! No ! - That 's my ship ! - Hey ! Who the hell has taken my ship ? - Hey ! Hey ! That 's my ship . Nope . All right . Try it again . No . What is it ? It 's caked with the same residue that 's covering everything . So we ca n't even send a distress signal . The engine 's so corroded down there you ca n't even tell what it is . I 've never seen anything like it . Halvorsen 's trying to salvage the parts , but basically what we are is dead in the water . Well , the radio 's dead too . Somebody 's not telling me what 's goin ' on here . What we 're seeing here may be the result of some kind of military experiment . - Military experiment ? - An artificial time band ... where matter moves through time at an accelerated rate . - Tell me in English . - Time may be speeding up . Right . That 's almost as crazy as Halvorsen 's " there 's a rock that comes down from the sky " ... This ship was launched in 1991 . I do n't know how else to explain the extent of the corrosion ... or the decay of the bodies down below . You 're not buying any of this , are you ? Oh , God . - What happened ? - His skull 's been fractured . Who is that ? Halvorsen . Who are you ? Captain Barclay , Commanding Officer , U.S.S . Ardent . Here you go . Captain Barclay , according to your log , shortly after the navigation system failed , several of your crew members saw something in the sea : A growing light . - Do you have any idea what it might have been ? - Power loss . Everything stopped . Everything . Even the sea . Even the wind . And the ship ... my ship ... She began to bleed ... from the hull through the rivet seams . He 's a drunkard ! He 's a drunkard ! And he killed Halvorsen . To hell with him ! I do n't have to listen to his lies . I 'm no liar . It happened . First to some of my men , then to all of_'em . What happened ? Time got lost . That 's okay , Captain . You can take it easy . We 're gon na do whatever we can to help you out . What can you do ? You ca n't do anything . I 'm 35 years old . - There 's no way he killed Halvorsen . - Yeah . I 'd have to agree with you . You were a good first mate . You left me alone , and you did your job . It 's a shame this had to happen to you so young . Put it down ! Put down the pipe ! Put it down . - I could kill you for what you 've done ! - Back off ! - He killed Halvorsen ! - He may be our only chance to figure out what happened . - Look at him . Look at him . He has n't aged . Back off . - His name 's Olafsson . - You know him ? Everybody in Tildeskan knows him . He 's a pirate whaler . He 's a wanted criminal . He supplies whales to thejapanese black market . - Blues , belugas , sperm . - Ask him how he got here . I do n't need a translator for that . We 'll question him later . I do n't wan na leave Scully alone in case there are others . I think we found who killed Halvorsen . The ship 's log said something about four sailors picked up when their vessel had sunk . I guarantee it was Olafsson 's men who took my boat and left him stranded there . It 's just like these dogs to slit each other 's throats . - Maybe we should ask the captain some more questions . - Mulder , Barclay is dead . I do n't know how it happened . It was just in the last 15 minutes . It 's just like those men below . It 's more than rapid aging , Mulder . - It 's almost as if he 's turning into a pillar of salt . - Is that what this is ? It appears to be crystalline , but beyond that ... All right . We 're all tired . Let 's stow the captain 's body , tie up Olafsson , so we can all get some rest . I 'll take first watch in case he 's not alone . - Scully ? - Hmm ? I just fell asleep . Then theoretically , it 's possible . What else could it be ? Whatever it is , it is n't a time warp . None of us has directly observed any of the phenomena recorded in the ship 's log . - There is no hard evidence to indicate this is a time warp . - We 're the evidence , Scully . Look at us . We 're aging by the minute . If this is rapid aging phenomena , why has n't our hair grayed or started to fall out ? And what about him ? Huh ? What about him ? Why is n't he getting old ? Relax . - Relax , Trondheim . Save your energy . - I do n't have to listen to you . - It 's because of you that we got into this . - Nobody twisted your arm . I signed on to bring you here , not to die . They can attack DNA proteins . They can cause our body tissue and cell membranes to oxidize . - Grow old , you mean . - Is the prevailing theory on how our bodies age . So you think something is triggering that reaction in us ? This is just a theory , but what if this ship is drifting ... towards another massive metallic source ... like a meteor . Maybe it 's way down deep in the ocean or embedded into an iceberg . But the two could effectively be acting as positive and negative terminals ... with the ocean itself being a kind of giant battery . That level of electromagnetic energy could be exciting the free radicals ... and effectively oxidizing every piece of matter in its field . It makes sense , Scully . The organic equivalent to rust would be rapid premature senescence . What the hell ? Captain Barclay said the ship was bleeding . It 's not blood , Scully . It 's rust . You see this yellow pipe ? It 's the only one that has n't corroded through . Olafsson and his men . Why were they holed up here ? This is the only drinkable water on the ship . We were both wrong , Scully . It 's the water . - All the other water 's been contaminated . - Contaminated how ? Something must 've got into the de-salination tanks ... where all the ship 's portable water is stored . But water in the sewage system is recycled again and again . It does n't come from the sea . If you 're right , then Captain Barclay 's drinking binge is what kept him alive . - And the water from this tank will do the same for us . It does n't sound like there 's very much left . What happened ? You were supposed to watch him . I feel pretty bad about it . He got away . - I wan na know what happened . - You 're the one that tied him up . There 's nothing wrong with my knot . This rope 's been severed . I do n't like being interrogated . I do n't owe you any explanations . Trondheim ! Let go of me . Look . We have a lot of work to do here . I 'm gon na need blood and urine samples from both of you . - What for ? - We found out what caused the aging . What is it now ? The two of you are full of theories . First it 's one thing , then another . - By the time you figure out what it is , we 'll be dead . - It 's the water , Trondheim . Something got into the de-sal tanks , but the water in the sewage system is untainted . It kept Olafsson alive this long . Maybe it 'll slow the process in us . Rudimentary blood tests have revealed impossibly high concentrations ... of sodium chloride : Salt . Though the contaminated water itself is not saline , it appears to catalyze existing body fluids , causing massive and rapid cellular damage . The untainted water has slowed the degenerative progression ... in Trondheim and me . But Mulder has fared less well , perhaps because of the dehydration he suffered on the way here . " I think I just lapped George Burns . I 'll be right back . If you 've got something to say , say it , but do n't hover behind me like that . The water is n't helping him . - Then maybe we should double his ration . - What for ? - A lake full of water is n't gon na bring him back . - We do n't know that for sure . - Not yet . - Look at him . - We 've wasted too much water on him as it is . But you and me , Scully , you and me ... We 'd better start lookin ' out for ourselves . " Mulder 's urinalysis continues to indicate ... his kidneys'failure to excrete the substance I 'm calling ' heavy salt . ' Whether the untainted water taken from the sewage system ... is even helping him at all is unclear . What does remain clear to me is that I ca n't give up trying . " Trondheim ? - What are you doing ? - Listen to this . You know what that is ? It 's a funeral bell . There 's only a few gallons left , maybe less . There 's enough to keep us all alive for a few more days . Or one of us alive long enough to be rescued . Do n't come any closer . What are you gon na do ? Shoot me ? Trondheim , listen to me . The Navy knows where we are ... - Why do n't you shoot me ? - If you think that I 'm gon na let Mulder have another drop ... Trondheim ? Trondheim ? You 're almost out of pages . It 's good you kept a record . Trondheim 's locked himself in the sewage hold . He 's back-flushed all the water , and he 's keeping it for himself . I looked everywhere , and this was all I could find . It 's sardine juice , half a dozen lemons ... and the water from a snow globe . It 's not Evian , but ... - You go ahead and drink it . - No , Mulder . It 's the only logical choice , Scully . You 're a woman . Your life expectancy is greater , and your body retains more water in fatty tissues . That 's more reason for you to drink it . You have a much greater chance of surviving till help comes . Do n't do this , Mulder . There might be . No . What was that ? The outer hull must 've finally corroded through , which means we 're taking on water . Mulder ... the water . Open . Okay . Open the door ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! Help . Help ... I always thought when I got older I 'd maybe take a cruise somewhere , but this is n't exactly what I had in mind . The service on this ship is terrible , Scully . It 's not fair . It 's not our time . We still have work to do . Mulder ... when they found me ... after the doctors and even my family had given up ... I experienced something that I never told you about . Even now it 's hard to find the words . But there 's one thing I 'm certain of . As certain as I am of this life ... we have nothing to fear when it 's over ... at approximately 4:30 this morning , the 12th of March . There is nothing more I can do for him or for myself . Supplies are exhausted . No food or liquid consumed for over 24 hours . The outer hull most probably flooded , though for now the inner hull is supporting the ship 's mass . Among Halvorsen 's belongings , I found a children 's book of Norse legends . From what I can tell , the pictures show the end of the world . Not in a firestorm of damnation as the Bible teaches us , but in a slow , covering blanket of snow . First the moon and the stars will be lost in a dense white fog . Then the rivers and the lakes and the sea will freeze over . And finally , a wolf named Skoll ... will open his jaws and eat the sun , sending the world into an everlasting night . I think I hear the wolf at the door . " Agent Scully ? Agent Scully , can you hear me ? Mm . I 've got you on dialysis with a high flux filter . You 're obviously responding well . Your electrolytes are almost back to normal , and your fluid status has been corrected . Mulder . Where is he ? His endocrine system was considerably more compromised than yours . Frankly , we did n't think that he 'd make it , until we discovered this . Based on your observations , we 're giving him a course of synthetic hormones , which seems to be working . Whatever caused this is still out there . I have to talk to a Naval liaison . - We have to salvage the ship in order to study the salt . - The ship was taking on water . It sank less than an hour after you were rescued .

This is our problem , not theirs . It 's just us ? Yep . Just us . We 're meeting Javi by the jetty in one hour . We did n't have a choice .  Javi just got screwed . We owe that kid this money .  I 'm sorry , smurf . Let 's go . I am sorry . You know for years , you paid Manny off to keep his mouth shut . - But me ? - You 're Craig 's father , for God sake . We had a baby together . Does he know that ? ! Huh ? ! No , he does n't know that ' cause you never told him ! You treat me like I 'm an employee !  . I do n't know where you think you 're goin ' . Anywhere but with you . Huh ? So you 're gon na leave Javi standing out there on the beach ? - I 'll take my chances . - Good luck . Not only are you on the run from Javi , now you 're on the run from me . Where were you ?  My leg opened up . Did smurf take you to a hospital ? No , no , the drugstore to get more antiseptic . And that took all morning ?  Dude , half the staples fell out . It hurt like a bitch , so I had to ...  Baz ?  Shit . Gearsshift , @engine_turns_off . There you go , man . Get out of the car . On your knees . Hands on your head . Your wife ...

Yeah , I know where I work . Max is going to be late today ' cause she got stuck on the subway . But you said yesterday she was late because she was stuck on the subway . No , I believe I said yesterday she got stuck under the subway . Oleg , a little help . Oh , Max ? Today she got stuck on a bus . And you said that the day before yesterday . - Earl ? - She got stuck between the moon and New York City . I know it 's crazy , but it 's true . Sorry I 'm late . I could n't find our cat , Nancy . Also , I was stuck on the bus or under the subway . Unless they told you something different , then I was doing that . Oh , come on . On the big rides at Disneyland . Nancy still has n't come home . I 'm freaking out . She 's the only thing I love .  Whatever . I had a cat once . He was cool . He was black and very sexually active . Oh , wait , the cool cat I 'm talking about was me . Earl , be careful , at your age , you could die having sex . I know . Those ladies do n't know whether I 'm coming or going .  ? Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ?  ? Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ? I think Nancy might be gone for good . I just ca n't believe she did n't take me with her . We had a deal . Max , she 'll come back to the apartment , even if she does n't want to . I mean , I always do . I am not surprised you 're not worried . " As in , " that cat " peed on my pillow . While I was sleeping on it , Max . Well , blame me . I got her drunk . Hey , everybody ! Look , girls , I got your pussy in my purse . Either that 's a cat , or you two got to keep better track of your belongings . Yay ! That cat 's back . See , Max ? I am excited .  Oh , I missed you so much . Oh , yes , I did . That 's not Nancy . That is a boy . Well , Max , sorry I do n't check out a cat 's junk the second it comes through the door . Yeah , you only look at the face . That 's the difference between you and me . See , look , the name tag says " Cinnamon . " No wonder that little girl kept crying and saying , " Give me Cinnamon , Give me Cinnamon . " Max , you are completely overreacting . - It 's just a ... - Oh ! Just a what ? Say it ! - It 's just a cat . -  You ! Hey , I 'm the one who fronted us that dollar to get her name tag . Thanks to me , someone 's gon na pick her up , look at it , and say , " Oh , you must be lost , little ... cat . " Nancy ! Her name 's Nancy ! I know her name ! It got momentarily pushed out of my head to make room for those 1,600 cupcake T-shirts we ca n't unload or pay for . You think I do n't wake up screaming four or five nights a week about those T-shirts ? But I know our cat 's name . You do n't wake up at night ever . No , I sleep like a dead baby , it 's my one gift .  Oh , the phone !  Unknown number . This could be it ! Oh , sure , great . - Thank you . - He has her ? He has Nancy ? Please , too little , too late . Max , we 're in $10,000 worth of debt and you spent money on new kitty litter ? Relax , I 'm going to pee in it , too . Well , I guess it beats that Sprite bottle you 've been using in your bedroom . It 's just such a long walk to the bathroom that every time I have to go , it 's like I 'm raising money for MS . Oh , I have good news . I found your lost bra in the litter box . Do n't think I 'm not still wearing it . I mean , why not ? I ate a hot dog that rolled under a car the other day . I left a couple of big clumps in , just to help you out a little . And do n't bring up the bra , we do n't know why she wanted it , but I 'm sure she had her reasons . Fine , I 'll be on my best behavior . But you watch and see how she treats me . It 's a two-way street . Hi , I have your cat . And surprisingly , your doorknob . Oh , that gum wore out already ?  Hi , buddy ! Hi , I 'm Caroline . This is Max . Thank you so much for bringing back ... - Nancy ! - I know ! And please note , she did not even look at me . Hi . I 'm Owen . Well , we are " Owen " you a big thank-you . Kind of low on cash , how would you feel about 1,000 cute cupcake tees ? Yeah , I do n't need 1,000 pink T-shirts . My dad 's already mad at me I do n't care about sports . Pardon me , may I get past ? Oh , manners . In our doorway ? I do n't know what to do . What 's next , a front stoop with no discarded heroin needles ? Yeah , I just came up there . Not today . Here , let me help . I mean , I 'm the dumb one who paid $2,000 for a cat carrier . Hmm . I miss being that stupid . You know , my cat ca n't get this open either . It must be the lack of thumbs . Rich , funny , and in a suit at 9:00 A.M . ? I really do n't know what to do . You know , my cat , Dickens , loves your cat . Oh , Dickens , after the author ? Dickens , after the author , Max . Yeah , I know who that is . The guy who wrote Muppets Christmas Carol . There . I knew I 'd get it . ' Cause I have thumbs . So , do you and Dickens live alone ? Oh no , she 's trying to flirt . I travel a lot for work . I 'm a venture capitalist . So you know how it is . Oh , I do . I absolutely do . - I ... - Here it comes . - Went to Wharton . - Boom . Well , if she gets lost again , you know where to find her . She 's been hanging around outside our window every day for the last couple of months . So I let her in . I hope that 's okay . Is that okay ? It 's awesome . I hope your girlfriend did n't mind . We just broke up . So I 'm single . And I better get going . I 've got a 10:00 meeting . Max , give the man his case . He has a 10:00 meeting . She does n't want to get out of cushy this thing . Well , here 's my card , just give me a call when you want me to pick up the case . You have a card ? A card , a meeting , a suit , a joke ? Are you the next bachelor ? Well , thank you , Owen Charles Boyd , for bringing back our beloved ... - Her name 's Nancy ! - I know her name . Why do I have to say it so fast ? She 's joking , she 's just not as funny as you . Well , it was nice to meet you . Bye , Nancy . Okay . Yes , I was flirting . But I was doing it for our business . You should really be doing it for your business . ' Cause your business is going out of business . He has a card . And it 's not for medical marijuana . He 's a venture capitalist . That 's the kind of fat cat that can help us get back on our feet . Hey , girls . Oh , you found Nancy . I knew she 'd come back pregnant . Wait , Sophie , how can you tell she 's pregnant and just not fighting the same battle Jonah Hill is fighting ? Well , her fur is thicker , she 's got a little sparkle in her eye , and there 's a little kitten head about to pop out of her patoot .  Come on . Push , Nancy . Come on , we all know what you did . Now is not the time to be shy . You do know what you 're doing , right , Sophie ? This is n't like the time you told us you could do your own bikini wax with a candle ? ' Cause I still have the vanilla-scented scars from that . Do n't worry . In my village , all the Kuchenskis women acted as animal midwives . It was the best way to meet guys . Strap in , girls . -  - Ah ! She 's crowning ! But it turns out she 's just like the rest of the women in my family . Screwed by some stranger she met in the dumpster . Okay , here we go .  Oh , there goes my ring . I ... sorry , Nancy .  Oh , here we go ! Come on , girls , I need some hot water and fresh towels . We do , too . For , like , four years . Uh ... how about some of these T-shirts ? Oh , sure why not use those ? They used to be our bright future . Now just a ShamWow for illegitimate cats .  Oh , my God , that must be the sound of a surrendering cat uterus . Well , it 's the first time a uterus has surrendered in that bed in a while .  I do n't know why I 'm not throwing up . Oh , wait . I 'm starting to .  Well , I 'm off Korean dumplings for life . This one ... Sophie , I got your text that you were in bed with Nancy . Who is this Nancy , and when did we go back to doing three-ways ? Nancy 's a cat . Mm , that 's a no . I 've got to draw the line somewhere . Well , I heard the news . Looks like you two are grandmothers before you 're 30 . Ca n't say I 'm surprised . Okay , before you even ask , I do n't pay for cat maternity leave . This is n't Google . This is n't even Ask Jeeves , Han . Well , I can help you get the kittens good homes . The people in my building are very nice . Except if you do n't recycle one bottle of sparkling cider , then nobody talks to you in the elevator . Han , we 're not giving the kittens away . Nancy landed herself a rich cat , we 're gon na be living off a hefty kitty support . " We 're trading " ? " We 're trading " is lonely white girl talk for " he has n't called me back . " I ca n't believe this . He 's a deadbeat dad . Max , he 's just busy . And I think you might be projecting a little because of your dad . Not that I 'm a therapist . I mean , I ca n't even afford a couch . I 'm not projecting . I just know a deadbeat dad when I do n't see one ! Where 's his card ? I do n't remember where I ...  Max , let go ! I 've got this . That guy can really help us with our business . Please , let me handle this . Look , Ryan Gosling .  - I got this . - I got this . - I got this . - I got this . Keep going , girls , I 'm almost there . I got this , Max . You 're way too emotional . You just went to third base with my apron . Sitting on this stoop is nice . How come we never sit out here ?   There it is . Oh , please , it 's just Rico . Rico looks good . I think he got another tattoo . Look , when Owen gets here , should we still be alive , please let me do the talking . Kittens aside , Owen can help us . A venture capitalist buys companies and turns them around . Yeah , I 've seen Pretty Woman . That 's how I realized I was n't charging enough . Go , Max , here he comes . All right , but I 'll be watching inside from the window . It 's probably better , because I do n't trust Nancy alone with those kittens . She 's got some serious postpartum . When I left the room , she was lighting a Menthol 100 with a shaky paw . Hi . Crazy we live walking distance from each other . The one with the bloody shoe hanging from it ? That 's the one .  You know what ? I 'm just gon na take the cat carrier . Before you go ... we have this small cupcake company that 's just begging to be an empire , and I wanted to pick your brain about some business stuff . Okay , so your Dickens got our cat pregnant , and she just had five kittens . And at her age , it 's a miracle we did n't have to pay for in vitro . How do you know they are Dickens 's ? I 'm not saying that Nancy 's easy , it 's just , I 've seen her go in and out of a lot of windows .  Did he just drop a gun ? It 's fine . He has more . Okay , call my assistant , you can pick my brain . I just do n't want it to be off the sidewalk . Really , I got to go . No , come in . I was just brushing my new loafers . I bought them as a break-up gift for myself . But unlike my ex-girlfriend , these have a sole . I did n't wan na mention the cat situation to your assistant . Next thing you know , it 's all over the lunch room : Owen Charles Boyd 's cat is a raw-dogger . Said it was an accident . Did n't feel like one . One shoe yes , but both ? Highly unlikely . Owen , sometimes in life , it 's not just an innocent cat that gets screwed . A girl can get screwed as well . Oh , hey , hi . What 's happening ? As in , screwed by one bad business decision . My partner , Max , and I recently invested all our savings in ... well , here , take a look . -  - Oh , my coffee ! - Oh . No , you dab . You do n't wipe suede . You dab . Dab . Dab . I 'm sorry . I used to know that . That 's Rich 101 . Let me just go find some water and I 'll dab , not wipe , this out . We 're not done yet . I 'm going back in . It 's going really well though . Where 's water ? Do you know how to unsend an email ? If I did , my rich ex-boyfriend would 've never found out what I thought of his lisp and I 'd be living in the " thouth of Franth " right now .  Where is he ? He needs to see these adorable bastards . Max , how did you find me here ? I told you I was going on a " think walk . " I followed you . I never noticed how much you check yourself out in store windows . You have a problem . Owen 's going to see that email and I 'm going to get fired . I have to start paying attention to details . I 'm just gon na go back in . What ? I do n't care . Not without me you 're not . Max , please , let me handle this . I 'm begging you . We 're getting close , look , I 'm holding his shoe . If he does n't step up here , these kittens will feel neglected , and it is only a matter of time till they are waitressing or worse . Max , you 're wrong . There 's nothing worse than waitressing . Max , stop ! You 'll ruin everything . I can fix this and us . We are beyond help . It 's all about these kittens . - Now move , I got this . - No , I got this . - I got this . - I got this . - I ... I came to your office with a basket of cats . Max , I 'm so sorry . Yeah , well , he 's the one who should be sorry . I want you to look these kittens in the whiskers and tell them that Dickens is not their father . What makes you think they 're mine . Why ? Because they look just like Dickens when he was a tiny baby kitten . Oh , and this one 's even cuter . And that one . I 'll take them all . But not that one . Seems a little off . Not quite as alert as the others . Oh , she 's not good enough for you ? - Max . Projecting . - I 'm not projecting . He said she 's not good enough for him . What ? Just because she was unplanned and not good at math ? Developed boobs way too early ? Okay , fine . I 'm projecting . It was more than business flirting . You begged to come to my office , show up wearing a see-through shirt . That was not by choice . It is cheaply made . I came here to talk to you about our business , and possibly get you to invest in a small , but spirited ... Invest ? This is the financial capital of the world .  Yes , it is . Why would I invest in a desperate little cupcake shop ?  You ! That 's it ! No cats for you .  You know what ? You are a self-absorbed , ridiculous pig . Says you . And your assistant . Check your email . I was able to unsend it . Yay ! Yeah , might want to re-ignite that LinkedIn profile . Have no fear , my building is loaded with lesbians . They take home rescue cats faster than they take home other lesbians . Okay , let 's discuss my terms . Unlike all my non-animal children , I want to know they 're taken care of . What part of lesbian do n't you understand ? They 'll be swaddled in a flannel shirt by nightfall . Okay , now this one , I call Junkie . ' Cause he 's got a serious Catnip problem . Oh , so you raised a drug addict within a week . Sounds about right . These two should try and stay together . We call them Game of Thrones One and Game of Thrones Two . ' Cause they 're siblings and lovers . This one 's the boy . Watch him and learn what humping looks like . This one 's pretty bland . She lays around , does n't meow much , and when she does , she 's kind of phoning it in . We call her Amy Adams . I mean , look at those nipples . And now the nipples are all I see . Have a nice life . I 'll find you on Instagram . Check out Grumpy Cat . Do what he does . Well , bye , kitties . And remember , stripping is n't dancing . And now all I can see is them wearing pasties . You know what , Max ? We do n't need that rich guy to fix our business . We can do it ourselves . Who am I kidding ? Our business is in worse shape than two retired guys in a golf cart . Well , you know what we 'd better fix ? Nancy . ' Cause he was right , she 's a slut . Someone just found

What about my parents ? They have no interest in walking in on this . Believe me . And my leather jacket ? - No , it 's fine . - Really ? Yeah , I like the red leather jacket . What the hell ? What in the hell is that ? It 's a dirigible ... from The Land of Untold Stories . What 's it doing in our town ? I believe you mean my town . This is not your town . Oh , tell that to the Dark One . He gave it to me . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I must prepare for my friends ' arrival . Regina ? Emma . Evil did not make you strong . Let 's do this . Hey ! Muttonchops ! A word of advice ... do be careful . Nothing more dangerous than an untold story ... and the people who do n't want them told . Hello ? Nobody in here . Where the hell is everyone ? Somewhere out in the forest . It 's hard to tell exactly how many people there are , but look . From the spacing of their steps , they were running . Now they 're out there , scattered . What does Hyde want with them ? It 's hard to tell . Depending on who he brought with him , these stories playing out could create chaos . Well , that 's helpful . But all may not be lost . You recall the orderly 's baton we used to subdue Hyde in our realm ? Well , that same technology made the dirigible . With the wreckage , I may be able to scavenge what I need to make a weapon that could work on him . Well let 's get salvaging . Hey , Emma , you okay ? Luv ? What happened ? Nothing . Come on . Let 's keep going . All right , Mr . Hyde . You have the keys to Storybrooke . Now tell me what I want to know . How can I wake Belle ? There is a place called The Temple of Morpheus . In it , you will find sands that will allow you to walk in Belle 's dreams . Then you 'll be able to wake her . Who are you ? I 'm Morpheus . Welcome to Belle 's dreamworld . Would you like to wake her up ? Shh . Zelena ? Regina ! Welcome to the madhouse . What is going on ? I 'm just unpacking . What 's happening out there ? Rumple handed the town over to Hyde . Say , sounds like it 's time for a showdown , does n't it , sweetness ? Hmm ? Now have a nice nap while Mummy helps barbecue mean old Mr . Hyde . Well , you kept me in worse prisons . I 've said I was sorry about that . I 'm joking . Seriously , you opened up your home to us , so for as long as we 're here , I 'm ... I 'm so grateful . It 'll be good for us . Oh ! I 've got something for you . Roland gave me something of Robin 's that he wanted to give to you . Really ? Yeah , it was , um , it 's a feather from one of his arrows . So sweet . You know what ? I , um ... I remember now . I put it away somewhere extra specially safe . Do n't even worry about it . A-A little chaos is normal . I 'm just going to put a protection spell around the house and over the vault and ... and you can ... find the feather ? I 'll find it . So ... you 're not angry ? Mnh . Hyde 's not getting into my vault . Well , we may not have to worry about him anymore . Jekyll finished his weapon . Oh . Handy one . Eager to defeat his better half , is he ? Yeah , he is . How are you dealing with that ... the whole " destroying your evil half " thing ? I 'm fine . Better than fine . It 's ... Did I mention I 'm fine ? Well , something 's bothering you . All right , yes . Something is gnawing at me . Something with red hair and a fondness for pointy hats . Your sister ? Look , this may sound petty , but Roland gave her something of Robin 's to give to me , and she already lost it . A feather from his arrow . Uhh ... I know you . This is n't about a feather . I do n't know what it 's about . Well , whatever it is , just talk to her about it . - Oh , do n't avoid this . - I 'm not . But you of all people should know ... heroism comes first . Emma ? Ready ? Yeah . Mr . Hyde ! Why do n't come out and take what you really want ? Or shall I deprive you the pleasure you seek and kill him myself ? Regina . Here 's what 's going to happen ... Leave town , and Jekyll is all yours . The problem is , my work is here ... in Storybrooke , and it 's only just beginning . So how about I alter the deal ? I take Jekyll and keep Storybrooke , and you avoid embarrassing yourself , because while everyone was afraid of the Queen , you ... not quite as much . No deal . Emma ! Emma ! Emma ! Emma ! Specially made . You wo n't be breaking out of those . Are you okay ? Is something wrong ? Why did you hesitate ? Nothing 's wrong . I 'm fine . Ignore him , Emma . Yes , ignore me ... just like your tremors . Wait . Wait . Wha ... what do you know ? More than you . If you wish to learn what 's been happening to you , you know where to find me . Archie . Hey . Pongo ! Hey ! What are you guys doing here ? Well , I heard you were out looking for new arrivals , and I thought maybe , uh ... maybe you want some coffee . My parents sent you . Yeah . Uh , they ... they 're a little worried about you , Emma . T-They thought it might be easier for you to talk to ... A cricket ? Eh ... sorry . I did n't mean that like I was , like , anti ... cricket . I just ... I 'm not really in the mood for therapy right now . And I 've found , usually , that 's when people need it the most . You 've been fighting bad guys for years without a break . But since then , with Henry and your family and Hook , those walls are down . - Is n't that a good thing ? - Of course it is . But it also let in all the collateral damage of all that fighting . Great . Then how do I fix that ? With time ... and ... and some hard work . Ca n't you , like , give me a pill or something ? When it comes to fixing our biggest problems ... Emma , there are no shortcuts . So , you 've taken me up on my offer . Smart girl . Keep calling me " Girl " and see how that works out for you . Why do n't you take these off of me and see how that works out for you ? You said you knew what was wrong with me . Prove it . Emma . You were a prisoner once . You know how this works . So you must know that prisoners respond to carrots and sticks , and you brought neither . Next time , try a bottle of Syrah and two glasses . You have no idea how to help me . I know about the battle ... the one in your mind 's eye . What ? I 'm sorry ... I thought you were just leaving . You 're right . I was in prison . The worst part about it was the loneliness . It sucked . Especially for a guy like you , who likes to talk so much . So , you can either tell me what you know ... or I 'll walk out of here , and I will not come back with wine . I just wo n't come back . Nobody will . You can just sit here in silence , and you can ... rot . So you did come with a stick after all . That 's very impressive , Savior . Except for one small thing . If you want to find them , just follow the red bird . The red bird ? The question is , are you truly ready to face your own story , Savior ? Ah . Here we are . My castle . Why would Belle want to dream about this place ? Usually , our dreams pick us , not the other way around . Rumplestiltskin . I-I did n't think you 'd be back from your journey so soon . Uh , do n't be angry , but I do n't have the tea prepared . I-I can have some ready in no time . Let her go . She 's lost in the dream . In her mind , she 's still a servant , and you 're still a beast . It 's fascinating , is n't it ... to learn how people really see you ? It does n't matter . I 'll find a way to wake her . I 'm afraid time is a luxury you do not have ... a most horrid , fiery fate . And this time , she will remain there forever . So I would hurry up , if I were you ... if you love her . Of course I love her ! That 's how I 'm gon na get her out of here . I 'll make her fall in love with me again . Look , I know my castle was n't exactly cheery , but it was never like this . To Belle , it was . This castle terrified her . So in her dream , it 's become a terrifying place . It 's also the place where we fell in love . If I can just re-create that moment ... It would just be some cruel trick . Are you willing to lie to her ? It may be a trick , but my love for Belle is true . My love for her and my child will never be a lie . See ? It 's not even chipped . Thank you . I think you 've done enough for one day . Why do n't you take a break ? Rumplestiltskin , what 's going on ? This , uh ... this is n't like you . I have a ball to attend to later , and I 'm a bit rusty . Will you help me practice ? I ... was n't aware that I had any choices here . You do . You 're doing wonderfully well . There 's just ... one more thing we need . What ... what has come over you ? Maybe I 'm tired of being a beast . One more dance ? I heard we got Hyde . I thought it would take weeks and weeks of battles and twists and turns , and ... here you go doing it Day 1 . Kudos to you , sis . Yeah . We got him . What 's wrong ? This is the first time I 've been back here ... since Robin died . I lost someone here , too . Zelena ... I 'm sorry , but please go . Should n't we be helping each other ? No . Why not ? Because ... I blame you . Every time I look at you , I-I blame you for what happened . Me ? ! What about Emma ? ! She dragged you to Hell ! Oh , I chose to go . But you ... I trusted you . And because of that , Robin 's soul was obliterated ! Want to talk about trust ? Okay . Let 's talk about trust . You made the biggest decision in your life , ripping out the evil part of you , and you just went to Snow White before coming to your own flesh and blood . Why do you even care ? ! You ripped out the part of yourself that was most like me ! I do n't know what you want me to say . The baby and I will be out by tonight . Okay , keep looking . That was Emma and Hook . It 's getting dark . It 's not going to get any easier . Wait , wait , wait . Hmm . Amateurs . They were in a hurry . They 're hiding because they 're scared . They do n't know they can trust us . Hello ? ! My name is Snow White . You can trust me . Hyde is locked up . He ca n't hurt you . The people in our town want to help . Snow . Look . There 's a place called Granny 's that 'll give you food , people who can arrange for shelter . Let 's go . We 'll be there whenever you 're ready . My parents ... They found some of Hyde 's people , sent them to Granny 's for food and shelter . Wonderful . I could use some food and shelter right about now . You go ahead . I 'm I 'm gon na stay . Stay ? It 's pitch-black and it 's freezing . Emma ... look at your hand . - What the hell is going on with you ? - Nothing . You can lie to everyone else , but you ca n't lie to me . It 's fine . I already asked you once to go . Right . Fine . No need to ask again . I see you met my pet , Emma . Who are you ? How do you know my name ? I know many things ... like why you 're here . The visions . Why the hell are they in my head ? Because these visions , Emma , they tell a story . The story of your future . Mom ? Why are you doing the locator spell ? Roland had a gift . Zelena lost it . Robin 's feather . You know better than anyone why it did n't work . It 's looking for him . And he 's gone . " Obliterated . " That 's how Hades put it . " His soul destroyed . But what I choose to believe in is faith ... hope that when a hero 's story is over , there 's a special place for them . This place is looking nicer . What a shame . Y-You 've lived here alone for so long . I have n't always been alone . There was a son . A son ? What happened ? He left . He saw the darkness in my soul . I had a chance to change for him , but ... I was too frightened to stop it . If , uh ... If you could change now ... would you ? For you ... I would be the best man I can be . Wha ... We 've ... done this before . Yes ! No . - Y-Years of promises . - Wait , wait ... I-I-I ca n't do this again . T-This time is different . None of this is real . This all happened a long time ago . We fell in love . We got married . Now that danger is gone , and I need you to wake up . This ... is the truth . But so is what I saw . All those broken promises ... Rumple ... I do love you , and I believe that you love me , but us being together ... it only causes heartbreak . But the b ... the baby . Our child will be better off waiting with me than being in debt to you . I was really hoping that you 'd say that . Wait . T-There 's still sand left . Wait ! I 'm so sorry that I put you through all of this . I just had to be sure that you would n't fall for his lies again . Now I can wake you up . " Wake me " ? But ... but how ? With true love 's kiss , of course . But I do n't love you . I-I do n't even know you . Oh , you 've known me ... what 's going on ? Oh , I think you know ... Mother . You 're our son . I will be . When you sprinkled that sand onto Belle , you sprinkled it onto me , too . This is n't just Belle 's dreamworld . It 's mine . And I 'm here to warn you ... Do not let him destroy us , like he did his last family . Do n't listen to him , Belle . He ca n't be our son . It 's not possible . Oh , but it is . And I 'll prove it . Belle . Our son ... h-he was testing me ... playing the part of Morpheus to see if I 'd do right by him . And like my other son ... I 've lost him , too . Even before he 's born . If you ever let true love wake you up , then maybe you would n't keep losing . We can discuss this at home . Oh , I 'll go back ... You keep saying I 'm seeing the future , but it feels like a memory . How do you know any of this ? I was once called an Oracle . You 'd be wise to trust me . What you saw was a tiny piece of future time . Yeah ... tiny . I need to see more . Knowing the future is a heavy burden . The future 's always in motion , always changing , but also inevitable . The visions are coming whether I want them to or not . Let 's get this done . Look . I 'm not gon na let you hurt them . What you saw was a small piece of the end of your story , Savior . There has to be another way . You can change the path to the destination , but the destination is the same . On the day you saw , in the battle you saw ... you will die . I see you found my friend . What 's coming , and how do I stop it ? Why would I want it to ? Whatever 's coming , whether you help me or not , I will defeat it . That 's funny . That 's what the Saviors always say . - What are you talking about ? - That 's right , Emma . You 're not the first Savior I 've encountered . Wherever there 's a Savior , there 's a villain who brings them down . That 's how the Savior 's story always goes . So , who is it ? I do n't know who your villain is . Maybe they 're already here . Or maybe they came with me . I expect you 'll want to help them , as Saviors do , but you have to ask yourself ... is helping them exactly what causes your story to end ? Thought you needed to be alone . Changed my mind . Can I have one of those ? - Thanks . - You 're in a better mood . And your hand ? It 's was just stress . You sure that 's what it was ... stress ? Promise . I 'm so sorry , Regina . I know it 'll work out , though . Emma and I had lots of ups and downs before we learned to really be honest with each other . Actually , I do n't think honesty 's our problem . Well , so what do you think it is ? Robin . I was an awful stepmother . Regina , come on . That was the past . I know I was . How did you maintain hope during those terrible times ? Well , when my mother died ... then my father ... I mean , I had nothing . And then I realized , while y ... well , the Evil Queen was trying to kill me ... that the only way I could stay alive was to never give up . You taught me how to have faith . You know , I 've been sitting here thinking about these new people and how pathetic they were for hiding in some horrible land so their stories did n't have to play out . And then I realized ... that 's exactly what I used to do . I do n't remember you hiding from anything . Oh , I did . My life just stopped . The only story I heard was the one I kept telling myself ... that I was ... the Evil Queen . Until finally , I forgot the most important thing . My life was never just one story . It was many stories . To some , a villain . I hurt people ... in ways I can never make up for . To others , I 'm ... a hero . They 've seen my strength , my ability to do the hard things , even when I thought I could n't . I want to start a new story . One where the Evil Queen does n't get a part . There you are . Regina ? Is n't life deliciously ironic ? All you ever wanted was a sister . And when you finally get that wish ... it 's the wrong one . You ... You 're alive . You ca n't get rid of me that easily . What do you want ? Oh , let 's have a drink , sis . It 's time for some sisterly bonding .

Hey , I got the legs for it . Ah , New Mexico . My great-grandfather once saw something mysterious in New Mexico . There he was , happily plying his trade , cowpunching .   BUFORD : It was a dangerous profession . Darn tootin ' ! Then one day , he saw it . What in the Sam Hill ? It was the elusive chompy-cobra ! The what ? Based on his extensive history of malapropisms , I would say that he is talking about the Chupacabra , the Latin American goat-sucker that is said to haunt the deserts of Mexico and Southwestern America . That 's just a myth , like the Lake Nose Monster and Klimpaloon , the magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas . Um , have you not proven those things to be true ? So we have ! Ferb , I know what we 're gon na do today ! However , if you currently are an animal , you may be excused to your missions . But ... What ? They get to go ? What is this ?

We 're off to New Mexico to find the elusive Chupacabra . But what are we going to use as bait ? Oh , I got that handled ! Check it out . It 's reversible . Ta-da ! A goat costume ! All right , then . Let 's start tracking us a Chupacabra .  Look ! Everything in my wardrobe is jinxed ! I was wearing this one when the boys made the giant gelatin monster . I was wearing this one when the boys split me into , like , 50 me 's . This one is from the whole Meap thing . And this one ... Well , I just spilled grape juice on it ... COMPUTER : Begin analysis . Rooting . Ooh ! Je Bust Number 12 ! COMPUTER : Sniffing . I guess I can wear this tonight . COMPUTER : Long neck . Non-desert-dwelling .  Not Chupacabra . Wait . Somebody 's judging me .

Let 's go check it out ! So that 's what a Chupacabra looks like . Yes . Surprising , is it not ? I think he 's kind of cute . Now we just have to get him back home !  Wow ! The Chupacabra does n't sound too happy . Aha ! I totally sound like that when my blood sugar 's low . Does your mom have any goat-based food products ? I do n't know .

Wait a minute . I better move this to the front lawn where Mom can see it right when she gets home !  Hello ? Mom ? Hi , Candace . What is it ? Mom , listen ! The boys have caught a Chupacabra . You have to get home quick and bust them ! Take it easy , honey . I 'm just a few blocks away . Awesome ! Thanks ! Whew ! Now all I do is wait while I sit on top of the crate for safekeeping .  Hold that thought . Mom will be back soon . Ha !   Hey , wait for me , guys ! Whoa ! The Chupacabra 's gone ! This must be how Candace feels when this happens . You know , I 've had it with you , Perry the Platypus . You never , never let me have the last ...  Curse you , Perry the Platypus !

CARL : Keep writing , sir .  Mom , you wo n't believe this . why would you ever give me reason not to believe you ? What if I told you that Phineas and Ferb captured an actual Chupacabra ? Well , that would test my suspension of disbelief . Well , disbelief no more ! ' Cause I got it right here .  I do n't believe it . Hey ! How did I get into that crate ? Well , I 'm at least glad to see you kids are going to finish up my leftover biryani . Yes , ma'am ! But ... But ... But ... I do n't get it . He usually shows up by now . Oh , there you are , Perry . but for a while there , we had a real-live Chupacabra . Here , we took pictures . Next . Next . Next . Next . Well , I guess perhaps the universe wants some things left unphotographed , like Chupacabras , or group photos where everyone has their eyes open .  STACY : Croutons , bouillon , platypus food . Ooh ! Microwave popcorn ! Need this . Does n't matter . I doubt we 'll even be able to eat while watching this movie . So scary no one over the age of 45 will even watch it ! Great ! Candace , are you sure you can handle this ? It took me four days to pry you out from under the bed the last time we saw a scary movie . What ? What are you looking at ? Oh , no . Phineas and Ferb ! What are you guys up to ? It 's a surprise , for Isabella 's birthday ! A surprise . Here we go again . For Isabella 's birthday . Give me those sodas . See ya ! Building supplies , check .

What do you think of the new energy-saving motion-sensor lights we 've installed in your lair ? Um , Agent P , try flailing your arms about . Uh , that should ... There we go . I want you to ...  Really ? Carl , I 'm waving my arms . Why are n't the lights coming back on ?  That 's not funny , Carl . Okay , time to commence Operation INAP . That stands for " Isabella 's Natal Anniversary Party . " I know what INAP means . Just get to the dangerous part . Okay , everyone , we need to carry all this stuff over to Isabella 's backyard so we can set it up for ...  Hi , Phineas ! What you doing ? You 're not planning something for my birthday , are you ? Do n't look , do n't look , do n't look ! Nothing to see here . Phineas ! But all I really want for my birthday is ... Do n't ruin the surprise .  You got it . But what ...  I 've carried a lot of squirming bags in my time , but this is the first time I knew who was in it ... Never mind . Perry the Platypus ! It 's no use trying to break through my protective bubble . It 's platypoof-proof ! I mean ... You know what I mean . Anyway , you 're probably wondering what I am doing driving this evil bug bus around town . I just got to thinking about all the things that bug me , like portable outhouses , high voltage signs . " Danger . High voltage . " I 'll decide how much voltage I can take ! That 's why I created the Bugs-Me-inator ! It turns whatever bugs me into bugs . Huh ? Oh , that 's on the out ...  Get off ! Get off ! Get off ! Get off ! Wait ! I 'm not ready !  Wow . Right to the point , huh ? You know , Perry the Platypus , more than anything , you bug me .  My shoe !  Get off ! Get off ! Get off !   Boy , I got ta really rethink the design on this thing . By the way , you know we 're on a runaway bus careening at high speed with no one at the wheel , right ?  STACY : Do n't go in there ! Do n't go in there ! Do n't go in there ! Do n't go in there ! Oh ! He went in there . Oh , gross , she brought thousands of tiny bugs into the house ! What could be worse than that ? Big bug !  O-M-G ! Really ? Really ? Why does everyone just stampede to that conclusion ? Other people wear lab coats , you know . Why do n't you say , " Oh , look , a rocket scientist " or " a veterinarian " ? Are you a veterinarian ? No , but that 's not the point ! Check it out . We made your favorite , a red velvet cake . With a little surprise . Phew ! I hope they do not have a male dancer popping out of it . They asked . But they could n't afford me . Will you do the honors , Ferb ?  Make a wish ! I wish for time alone with Phineas .    What are you doing ? so I can call my mom to come bust the boys . That 's not dangerous ? Dude , this is nothing . It 'll get worse . So , did you get what you wished for ? Uh ... Yeah . Let 's go , you two . Next event ! You 're gon na love this ! Is this where you go every day , Perry ? Uh , yeah , pretty much . I create inators and he breaks in and thwarts my scheme , and ... It 's kind of our thing .   Ooh ! The Grievance . I saw this at the theaters . I still have nightmares about that greasy little girl who comes up out of the basement . No ! Do n't tell me how it ends ! And now , what 's a birthday party without a pinata the size of your house ? Ferb ? Hit it ! Whoo-hoo ! I 'm gon na bash this thing ! Yeah ! Give up the candy , yo ! This is n't dangerous enough ? Isabella , this must be your best birthday ever ! Yeah . Sure . It 's super cool . But I did n't need ... Okay , birthday girl .  Um , this might be the time to call . Yep !  Mom ? You got ta come across the street . Immediately ! ALL : Ooh ! What a grand and glorious and potentially bustable gift ! I 've never seen anything like it . Not that key . Not that key ... Mom ! Mom ! Mom , you got ta see what the boys are doing in Isabella 's yard ! Isabella 's yard ? That 's a new one . All right , look , you 're getting oil all over the place . Someone 's gon na have to ...   No ! It 's the greasy grievance girl from the basement !  No ! No ! What have I done ? Why do you have a grievance against me ?  Whoa . What was that all about ? Do the Flynn-Fletchers know you fight evil scientists ?  Back here , Mom ! Butterflies ? I love butterflies !.. Butterflies ? How long did it take you guys to collect them all ? Let 's go , boys . Looks like we 've got some cleaning up to do . MONOGRAM : All right , you , and you , I 'll need a containment barrier around this area here . And you , set up the mind-eraser over here by the vermilion ...  Danville Water and Power ! We 're here to read your gas thingy . Perry ? What is all this ? A host family ? Mind erasing ? Balloon cover-up ? I mean , is all this really necessary ? Wait a minute . It says right here in your silly little pamphlet that if your host family finds out about your agent status , then everyone who 's seen you has to have their memory erased , Perry , I 'm not part of your host family . I know , I know , it 's a technicality . So , uh , ca n't we just keep this a secret ? Luckily , sir , it looks like the residents were not home .  Hello ? Uh , anybody there ? MONOGRAM : I 'll take care of it . Oh , hello there , young teenager . Do you live here ? Yes . I walked home from the mall to find this . What is happening here ? Oh , you did n't see what happened . Well , uh , we 're with the city , and there was a swamp gas incident here , uh ... We 'll just get it all cleaned up and get out of your hair . We 're not gon na need the mind-erasing device ... I ... I mean , monkey wrench .  It 's a monkey wrench . Yeah . We do n't need that . Happy birthday , Isabella ! Thanks , guys !.. Phineas , I really liked the butterflies . Thank you . Well , to make it up to you , it 's kind of lame , but maybe Ferb and I could , I do n't know , take you out for some ice cream or something ? Uh ... I just remembered there 's something I need to do . You two go . Is that cool ? Yes . Very cool . Ferb . PHINEAS : So , did you get what you wished for ? Oh , yeah , I already asked that . Confetti and streamers ! Hold on . Gon na get another napkin . And butterflies . You always give me butterflies . CANDACE : Ah , look at them out there . What are they up to ? Ah , looks like Phineas is saying ,  " Where 's Perry ? " Huh .  I do n't know why I was asking you . Whew ! No one suspects a thing . 
@@5244141 Kentucky , you have 53 votes . How do you cast them ? Madam Secretary , as a senator for the great Commonwealth of Kentucky , I 'm proud to speak on behalf of the delegation 's chair . The Commonwealth of Kentucky , home of the Derby , the Wildcats , and the birthplace of bourbon , for Vice President of the United States , casts 13 votes for Secretary of State Catherine Durant ... 11 for Senator Joseph Baker of Nevada , nine for Governor Randall Smith of West Virginia , seven apiece for Governor Jill Haley of Florida and Congresswoman Sharon Pierce of California , five for one of our own , the Mayor of Louisville , Jill Carson ... and one vote for the First Lady of these United States , Mrs .

I 'm surprised you did n't get a few votes yourself , Senator . I 'm not running for vice president . Trying to throw some levity into the proceedings , sir ? Hell , no ! I think she 'd make a terrific vice president . - Mrs . Underwood ! - Mrs . Underwood ! A couple of questions , Mrs . Underwood , if you have a moment ? Yes , I only have time for a few . Welcome to Atlanta , Mrs . Underwood . Thank you . Can you comment on Senator Sheer 's vote ? Well , I am flattered . But it 's all in good fun , I 'm sure . Mrs . Underwood , he says he 'll vote for you again . Well , I am encouraging everyone , including Senator Sheer , to vote for Cathy Durant . Both the president and I think she is the best choice in the field . You changed everything we wrote . There was no imagination to it . No rhythm . We 've been writing their speeches since they took office . We know what we 're doing . So I 'm hoping that the Senate will follow their lead soon , and that the president can sign it into law .

Let 's talk about the contenders themselves . There 's almost a dozen of ' em . - Can you , uh , lower that , please ? - ... really have a chance . Durant , first among ' em . It 's 11:00 in the morning , day one , and they 're beating Ellen . Less traffic on the website , too . Yeah , well , that was last month . This is this month . We announce a stellar running mate . He eviscerates Underwood on ICO . We have not one , but two Vanity Fair covers that Pollyhop 's pushing , and all you give me is excuses . The point was for us to drown out their convention , not the other way around . We need to steal the thunder back . So go where the thunder is . I 've been one heartbeat away for almost two years . My heart 's not in it anymore . I 'm going to head back to Vermont after November . Maybe start teaching again . Who are you supporting , then ? On the record , Cathy Durant . And off the record ? I 'm not the biggest fan . Why ? She was n't much help during the Russia crisis . - She closed the deal with Petrov . - She took credit for it , sure . The First Lady ? The former ambassador . We 're closer in Kansas , but still not close enough . Did you speak to Jefferies when you were there for the House vote ? He 's leaning on Fred Simms . If Simms could deliver two or three delegates ... That could push Kansas over the edge . I can call Womack . He 's got some friends over the border . - What about Pawley ? - Pawley ? Sheriff Pawley in Fort Worth , old family friend of my dad 's . He 's close with some superdelegates from Dallas . Yes , he 's on board . Got ta love those sheriffs . - That 's how we do in Louisiana . - What about Enright ? I 'm meeting him for coffee at the Hyatt . In fact , I better get going . I do n't wan na be late . Now , if we could lock up Virginia ... It would send a very big message . And then Kentucky next . He 's got a big old crush on you . You know , I 'm having fun . I forgot how much I miss being whip . You whip ' em . I 'll sweet talk ' em . Nothing like leather and sugar . Sir ? Senator Sheer . Senator , you did a fine job . Yeah , I better get prime time , not one of these midmorning speeches . Eight o'clock , Wednesday night . I called Patti myself . Do you know the main thing that separates a politician from the rest of the species ? A politician is the one who would drown a litter of kittens for ten minutes of prime time . Secretary Durant . Editor in chief , Politico . It 's all right . Adam , are you covering this yourself ? First open one since ' 68 . It 's humid as hell , though . I just got here and I 'm already soaked . On the plus side , I hear they have the best strip clubs in the country . Nothing on the record . Tell me about the rumors regarding the deal you struck with Petrov in Brandenburg . What rumors ? That it was the First Lady who brokered the deal , not you . It was a team effort . Who is your source ? I ca n't . You know that . Well , I 'm afraid that 's all the time I 've got . Have a good trip , Adam . The president was on site this morning for a press briefing at the Truxton Marquis with Karen Williams , the mother of Daniel Williams , the organ donor who provided his liver . Alongside him were all of the donor organs ' recipients . Ms . Williams took time to speak with each recipient whose life was saved in the wake of her son 's passing . The president used this solemn event to express his gratitude for those who share their lives for the health and welfare of others , whether through organ donation or through their work . The president 's condition has improved dramatically since his organ donation . Sixteen-year-old Daniel , who saved President Underwood from his health crisis , left this world by giving back to so many others he never expected to touch . Lasting tributes like this will not be forgotten . Currently , there are more than 122,000 men , women and children seeking an organ transplant each year , most common needs being the kidney , liver , and heart . And while the number of donors has increased over the years , recipients are still in for a long , potentially fatal waiting period before a healthy , matching organ becomes available . Waiting lists for these types of transplants can last from days to months on end . Although President Underwood 's critical condition pushed him to the top of the donor list , he was fortunate to have received a donation in time . Many status one , or most in-need patients do not receive a transplant in time to save their lives . Tennessee ! You have 77 votes . How do you cast them ? From the Volunteer State ... - Cathy ! - The meeting with Enright went well . I put a call into him afterwards . He said you charmed him . - That puts us where ? - Nine-forty-nine . We wo n't make this ballot , but we 're getting close . Next one . I 'm sure of it . Let 's talk once we get the final numbers . Will do . Bye . - Texas , you have 237 votes . - Do you have my call list for tonight ? How do you cast them ? Madam Secretary , my name is Ruiz Trejo . I see . Uh , I ran into Giovanni in the elevator . You can cross him off . And cross off Milford . She said she 's gon na back Baker till the bitter end . We cast all of our votes to our native daughter , the First Lady , and the future Vice President of the United States of America , Claire Underwood . I just emailed you my donor lists for Austin and Houston . Should be at least two million in the bank . - Ms . Jones . - Oh , that 's great . Oh , I got ta go . The cameras are here . Ms . Jones , the entire state for the First Lady . Will you comment ? I think our unanimous vote is all the commentary you need . Now , the president endorsed your race , uh , your mother 's vacant seat , uh , during the State of the Union . He sure did , and I 'm proud to be the front-runner . Did that endorsement have anything to do with your support of the First Lady ? Look , I wo n't deny that the Underwoods have been good to me . But no . They asked me to vote for Catherine Durant . And while I think Secretary Durant would be a wonderful woman for the job , I think Claire is the best woman for the job . All right , we 'll speak soon . New draft . LeAnn wanted me to work in some phrases ... and keyword amplifiers . All I 'm asking is that you make the call . He 'll listen if it comes from you . It seems very clunky . I agree . Is there a way to ... put in what she wants and make it ... - more elegant ? - He 's still pissed about that limp-dick defense bill I killed when I was whip ... Maybe ... but I have my limitations . Well , you do n't have much faith in her analytics , I do n't think . It 's paint by numbers . Yes , well , she also says that you 've been alienating some of the other speechwriters . Eh , well , their mediocrity is what 's alienating them . I 'm allergic to it . - I work better alone . - Let me speak to Bryce and then see what I can do . That 's right ... I have to go . Let 's discuss the speech later . Hmm . Yeah , all I need is just three more from your state and we 've got it . Yes , just a ... just a few more . Like , three . Yes , and so do I . I 'll talk to you tomorrow . Good night . - Tom . - Hmm . I feel like we have n't even had a chance to say hello since you came on board . You 're a busy man . I do n't know the opposite . It has its upsides . Like sleep . And friends . How 's the , uh ... Oh ... You know , if it were n't for the pills , I could go through entire days without even thinking about it . I wonder what that kid would think ... if he knew that part of him was inside of the president 's body . What ? " One man 's trash . " That 's how the saying goes . Oh , right . How 's the speech coming ? Uh ... Well , this is for the introduction to your acceptance speech , but ... should n't it be for her own acceptance ? You want Claire to win , not Durant . A First Lady as the ... That 's ludicrous . I do n't think so . And I do n't think you do either . Oh ... Maybe I 'm wrong . But if I 'm right ... she 's gon na need the speech to end all speeches . And it would be good for me to know that . I have some more work to do . Governor ! How are you ? Yeah , well , I wish I was in Oregon , too , but I 'm here in Atlanta where it 's muggier than a street hooker 's twat . I am honored to be mentioned with Secretary Durant and Senator Baker . They 're seasoned politicians . And my home state , so let 's not make more of it than it is . Claire ! Congratulations . I think you 're in fifth place now . Yeah , with you in first , where you should be . Secretary Durant , do you think the First Lady has a shot ? I think Texas just gave her one . Kidding aside , do you think she has the foreign policy experience ? It 's beside the point . And like I said this morning , I encourage everyone , including Texas , to vote for Secretary Durant . Mrs . Underwood ... You know what , if you 'll excuse me , I want to get back to the phones , make sure Cathy gets this nomination . - Thank you . - May I have a moment ? Oh , of course . Did anyone ask you about Brandenburg or any of your people and your involvement there ? - Brandenburg ? - Hmm . No , we put that to bed . We all agreed to what our version of the story is , so somebody is n't toeing the line . Well , I 'm sure it 's not White House staff . I bet he 's just fishing , trying to start some rivalry . Well , I 'd be grateful , if he asks you , or anyone else ... Of course . And I 've been sticking to our story ... which it was you that got the Russians to back down , and I was just there to support you . That would n't look good to the delegates , the fact that you met with Petrov without me . It would look like I was n't in command of ... No one needs to know what we discussed . You have nothing to worry about , Cathy . Honestly . Well , yeah . Well , that 's cutting it close . He 's at a big dinner with the Florida congressional delegation tonight . Well , all right , and call me back . The rumors have gotten to Cathy . Well , we did want them to spread . That was the idea . I think one of us needs to speak with her . Yeah , but the plan was to wait till it was inevitable . If we do n't involve her sooner than later , Francis , she could turn on us . All right , you take your meeting with Baker . - I 'll talk to Cathy . You set that up . - Yes , sir . How much are you going to say ? Just enough to prepare her . Yeah ... A lot of calls about Mrs . Underwood in Russia . Denying ? Ignoring , which is the same as confirming . - Good . - Claire in there ? She 's speaking privately with the president . - No . I refuse to believe that . Doug , if our campaign manager bites the dust , that hurts us . I gave you a task . And I 'll keep at it . Nice coverage on the liver thing this morning . I emailed you some links . Boys are older now , both married . Got a third grandkid on the way . We do n't get out to the lake much these days . Washington takes its toll . It sure does . I 've made a lot of sacrifices over the years , Mrs . Underwood . Time with my boys , that 's a big one . Who knows if I 'll win , but I 'm in the mix . And I ca n't sacrifice this opportunity to pave the way for Cathy Durant . You wo n't win , Senator . We both know that . But I ca n't help her . Now , I realize you two do n't get along . She despises me ... - The moment she became Secretary of State , she got the Republicans to remove me from the Foreign Relations Committee . And Francis was very upset about that . But that was the past . Let 's talk about the future . This support for Claire , it 's caught us both off guard . But you are my choice for vice president . Nothing has changed on that front . Well , my only concern are the rumors . They could damage my chances . Yes . And we 'll do what we can to combat those . That 's what Claire said , too , and it 's much appreciated . But , if , and ... Oh , God , it 's a big if . But what if ... support for Claire picks up steam ... Well , you do n't actually think that will happen ? Oh , no . I mean , a First Lady as VP ? No . The party wants someone with experience , and so does the country . Absolutely . But ... I mean , the press is certainly enjoying imagining it . Well , sure . It makes for a good story . Yeah , and it 's the kind of coverage that we ca n't really control . You know , I mean , these things have a way of taking on a life of their own . Like the Zoe Barnes story did about my nomination for Secretary of State . Except that one we planted . - And this one you didn't . - No , absolutely not ! I mean , Claire was mortified by those votes . What you 're saying is if the coverage influences enough people ... Well , we have to be prepared for that . I mean ... of course , politically , it would be a disaster . Maybe , maybe not . You do n't think so ? Well , personally , I think Claire would do an excellent job . Well , I am very surprised to hear you say that . Well , most of those were from Texas , which was a lark . Was it ? I have as many delegates as you do , Senator . - But if you start pushing yours my way ... - You double . And take the lead . - And then Cathy puts you over the top . - That 's the idea . So she 's in on this ? She will be . Well , let 's say Claire does take the lead , however unlikely that may be ... - Very unlikely , I would say . - Well , let 's say she does . What do you propose ? I honestly do n't know . Well ... Well , you 'd have to support her , would n't you ? You ... you ca n't abandon your own wife . Uh , true , but I ca n't abandon you either . Well , if she took the lead , I suppose I 'd have to support her , too . We 're on the same team here . Well , to be perfectly blunt ... what 's in it for me ? What would it take ? You 're doing the selling . Make me an offer . Let 's say Claire gets it . I assume I stay on , if you get the general . Oh , absolutely . I can not imagine the next four years without you being my Secretary of State . You 'd give me Cathy 's job ? We 're prepared to . - Doug . - Madam Secretary . We have an issue , sir . When I first warned the president that ICO would grow , and grow quickly , he did nothing . Yesterday , the leaders of ICO sent out this tweet . " As Suwar is ours . Soon heads will roll into the Euphrates . " That was n't just in Arabic , that was in English , and sent out in 16 other languages . They 're media savvy , they 're recruiting around the globe . We must act , Mr . President , and we must act now . Normally , there 's a tradition of sportsmanship when it comes to conventions . One candidate lays low so the other gets his or her moment in the spotlight . But not only is the president ignoring a great threat to the world 's security , he 's insulted the one man who stood up and spoke out for us all . When this profile came out about everything the general just mentioned , the White House said that he was politicizing terrorism . And when I announced that General Brockhart was going to be my running mate , the president 's campaign said , and I quote , " It 's a shame the general traded in patriotism for careerism . " Now , I do n't call that very sportsmanlike . I call it disgraceful . How many wars has the president fought for his country ? I think we all know , none . President . I demand that you do something about ICO . And I demand that you make an apology to the general . And we 're not leaving Atlanta until you 've done both . Live on every network right now . I got ta hand it to him . I wonder if this was his idea , ' cause it 's almost something like I would do . We ignore him . It 's 95 degrees . Let him sweat it out . I think the longer we ignore him , the more attention they 'll get . I agree with LeAnn . So apologize . It 's only pride . I can do it if you want , sir . I wrote the statement . No , it only works if it comes from Francis . Claire 's right . And we can do more than just apologize . I can meet with the bastard . The issues the governor and the general raise are important ones . They transcend party affiliations and , quite frankly , politics ... whoever becomes the president is going to have to deal with ICO and all of the other terrorist threats that we face around the globe . So I 'm looking forward to hearing whatever ideas and solutions that they may have ... because a smart president will steal good ideas from anyone . Let 's kill them with kindness , shall we ? - Governor . - Mr . President . Would you please put the general on the line ? Sir ? General ... your service to this country is greatly valued and your patriotism is without doubt . And in the heat of the campaign , well , we went too far . We issued statements that we should n't have , and for that I want to apologize , and I do hope that you will accept it . Far more important to me than an apology is eliminating ICO , Mr . President . I could n't agree with your more , General . President . And will you join us , Governor ? Only if it leads to real action , not just talk . I can promise you , Governor , and the rest of America that it will not just be talk . Then , yes . If it truly leads to securing our freedom . Thank you very much . I look forward to seeing you . Thank you all very much . Right this way , Governor . Do you think this a good idea ? What choice do I have ? He called my bluff . Welcome , Governor . Thank you , Mr . President . I have a room set up for us . Here . Have some lunch . We 've got ham , and I think some turkey . I 'm good , but thanks . Really ? After the stunt you just pulled , I would 've thought you love ham . You put this here on purpose . Well , a little reading material , you know . Something to pass the time . Ben Grant owns Pollyhop ... That 's right . And you own Ben Grant . Is n't that what power is ? The people you collect ? You really screwed me with that webcast . I had everything all planned out . The Federal Election Commission , the Department of Justice . I was looking forward to watching you go down in flames ... maybe even behind bars . Well , I 'm sorry I ruined your fun . It 's a bit embarrassing , though , is n't it ? I mean , sharing all your most intimate moments ? Videos of your children ? I 'm proud of my family . Why would I be embarrassed ? Well , just that you have to stoop so low to win everyone 's love . It feels a bit desperate , does n't it ? You 're 15 points behind in every poll . So , if anyone 's desperate , it should be you . Why would we want to do that ? It 's why we 're meeting . Oh , right . " Real talk , real action . " That 's what you 're all about , is n't it ? Well , I suppose we could if you want to , but ... then again we could just take a break from it all and relax a bit . Oh ... God . This turkey tastes like rubber . Well , it 's better than eating a real one . Hmm ? Oh , I always wear protection when I 'm getting my dick sucked by the Democrats . You okay ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Do n't make me laugh when I 'm eating . I nearly choked to death . Well , that is one way for me to become president . - Here you go . - Thank you . - You okay ? - Oh , yeah . Hmm . Oh , yes . Tom Yates . That 's one person you were n't able to collect , were you ? What did you do to get him back ? Oh , look , I 'm sure he was tempted . He is a fiction writer , after all . You 're a New York Republican . That 's an attractive fiction , is n't it ? And you 're a Democrat from South Carolina , that 's even bigger fiction . Well , there you go . And I 'm a New York Republican , which is basically a Democrat . If you were a Democrat , you 'd be unstoppable . You 'd be the new JFK . And if you were a Republican , who 'd you be ? Nixon ? Nixon was a far more effective president . The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot . See , if people want a piece of you ... you give it to them , right ? Oh , is that what people want ? A piece of you ? Do you play video games ? No . My kids do . There 's this one game that my son Charlie , he loves to play . It 's called Agar.io . I have to admit , I might have played it a couple of times myself . You start out as a little dot . And then you go around eating these other dots and you get bigger . And the bigger you get , you got ta avoid getting eaten by the bigger players . Meanwhile , you 're trying to eat the smaller players . Hmm . Sounds a little like running for president . So , are you playing with real people right now ? Yeah . From all over the world . - Here , you try it . - Hmm . - Oh , I got eaten . - Press that . Oh , God . I got eaten again . I wonder what the other players would think if they knew who they were playing against . Oh , I 'm rather enjoying the anonymity . This is unprecedented . The president and Governor Conway are meeting right now at the convention hall . Two candidates , face to face . They 've been in there for about ten minutes , supposedly discussing the ICO situation . Now , while the private meeting between the two candidates continues behind closed doors , delegates on the floor are gearing up for the next round of voting for ... We should head down . The next ballot is starting soon . - I 'll be down in a minute . - In the second round of voting a quarter of the delegates changed their votes , support for First Lady Claire Underwood is picking up steam , thanks in part to today 's breaking story about Mrs . Underwood 's involvement in the Brandenburg negotiations . Oh . You 've , uh , got a call . Yeah , I better take that . They only call if it 's important . Yeah , this is Will . Yes , put it through . - Um , excuse me . - Sure . Go ahead . Damn ! Nothing . The fog of war . A back room within a back room . Whatever 's being plotted in there , I can tell you it 's no good for me . You know , it 's at times like these I wish I was Nixon , had every nook and cranny bugged . - Mr . President ? - Your colleague . How targeted can he get ? We really should n't be discussing this over the phone . Can he isolate a specific person ? Technically , yes , but ... A conversation ? There are catch mechanisms in the program to prevent that . He can override , but it leaves a trail . He 's still figuring out how to mask it . Our friend from New York . I also advise that we hang up . All right , I 'm hanging up . Governor , should we head out ? Just a moment , Mr . President . There 's a great deal of anticipation in Atlanta ... Who was that ? The president . He just wanted the latest delegate count . ... and we 're minutes away from the next ballot . Here 's a graphic of the last round yesterday . Secretary Catherine Durant led the way with 22% of delegates . Doug hates it . He hates what ? That you have direct access to the president without going through him . He wants you gone . Doug told you that ? He wants me to dig something up on you . I have n't found anything yet . And you wo n't , because there is n't anything . I know . Otherwise , I would 've found it by now . Why are you telling me this ? Because either you 're gone or I am , if I do n't deliver ... It can be small . Nothing too damaging . Just so I have something to show him . In my 30 years of covering presidential politics , I 've never seen anything like it . Sorry about that . That 's all right . Shall we go out ? The next ballot is about to start . You want to watch it together ? It might look better , the longer we 're in here . Like we grappled with the future of America . Unless you 'd rather be out there with the masses . Oh , Christ . The masses . - I feel the same way . - We will now commence the third ballot for the nomination of our party 's vice presidential candidate . We will start with Alabama . Eight votes for Secretary of State Durant , six votes for Senator Joseph Baker , four votes for First Lady Claire Underwood . California , you have 476 votes . Two hundred and thirty-three for Catherine Durant , 152 for Joseph Baker , 91 for Claire Underwood . That 's huge for the First Lady . That puts her in third , and she 's closing in on second . Delaware . Twelve for Durant , 11 for Claire Underwood , four for Baker . Hawaii , you 're next . Seventeen for the First Lady , and 14 for Secretary of State Catherine Durant . She 's got a real shot . Unbelievable ! Well , not so unbelievable . Forty-four votes for Catherine Durant , 35 votes for Claire Underwood . Louisiana , you have 61 votes . How do you cast them ? Madam Secretary ... Louisiana casts its 61 votes for President of the United States to Secretary of State Catherine Durant . Louisiana , I assume you mean vice president . I mean president . Louisiana ! Louisiana ! As the convention agreed to yesterday morning , we are taking vice presidential nominations first , in order for that process to take place over the full convention . We have one candidate for president . Any further discussion on that balloting will be taken up after the vice presidential nomination process is complete . If you do not cast your votes , you will forfeit them . Madam Secretary , we , Louisiana , cast our 61 votes for vice president , also for Catherine Durant . Louisiana . I work for the man . I 'm on his cabinet . Would you run against him if his nomination were in play ? My goal is to run with the president , not against him . Look , I love my home state of Louisiana , - but they 're a live bunch ... - She 'd do a good job . She 's a much better Secretary of State , though . I 'm confident this will all work itself out . Hey , this is part of what a ... - Your call . - ... convention is all about . I wish I could take credit , but ... but she called me . Then again , when opportunity strikes ... Thank you very much . Definitely not the way to win with dignity . ... Durant commenting on her home state of Louisiana . If you win at all . We should get back out there . You 've got a nomination to fight for . The president and I , we had a great talk . We , uh , even watched the vote together . But I 'm sure you 'd rather hear from him on that than me . Well , thank you , Governor . Today has certainly been full of surprises , has n't it ? But , then again , Louisiana is the state that gave us Huey Long after all . - Thank you , Governor . - Thank you , Mr . President . Thank you all very much . I 'm happy to answer ... I want Cathy in my room , now . I already called her . She refuses to meet . - She what ? - That 's what she said , and then she hung up . Her staff wo n't return my calls either . For this to work , you have to go back to Washington . I ca n't leave while you 're dealing with this . If you stay , it will look like you 're taking advantage and campaigning for it . And the key is to make it look like you 're not . I 'll speak with Cathy . No , look , I 've got that covered . Question is , how we justify your going . It 's not Washington . It should be Texas . - Your mother . - It worked before . - Did you tell him ? - He put it together . He said , if you win this thing ... you have to give the speech of a lifetime , and he 's right . Whatever you say in that convention hall will lay the groundwork for how we sell this to the rest of the country . And that is why we brought him back , right ? You can sleep like that ? Sitting up ? I can sleep anywhere . I 'm lucky like that . We have work to do . All right , let 's work . This could be better . Read it for me . Out loud . " I 've been my husband 's partner in marriage for 29 years . " No . Slower . Like you 're going to say it at the convention . " I 've been my husband 's partner in marriage for 29 years . Now , it 's time for me to be ... " So I can see your face . " You 're right . We can do better .

ANGEL : Nice to have a view . Bet you spend a lot of time enjoying it . Not that much . Well , I do n't see any harm in looking . It 's about all I can do anymore . - What is it you want ? - Your help . Wondering if you 'd seen these men across the way in the gym . No , do n't think so . I 'm more of a girl-watcher , know what I 'm saying ? Jeez . They all died ? How ? - That 's what we 're trying to find out . - You work with police ? I 'm a private investigator . I work with a team . Sounds nice . I was a salesman . Worked alone for 50 years . Nothian herb jar . That 's a pretty exotic item . Did you deal in the occult ? Occult , shmoccult . I traveled a lot , picked up some trinkets . Do a lot of bungee-jumping , Mr .  You might wan na think twice about casting a -- You are me . FAKE ANGEL : That 's gon na smart later . CORDELlA : Hello ? FAKE ANGEL : Hello . So , what did you find at the old folks ' home ? Nothing . Did n't pan out . How about you ? Got a two-month free trial membership and made some new friends . All right , I got nothing . Pretty clear we ' re barking up the wrong tree , huh ? Yeah . Well , get in . I 'll take you back to the hotel . All right ! You and me , going back to the hotel . Nice . - Are you all right ? - Honey , I 've never been better . Nice . You supposed to be back there ? Ding , ding . Paying customers . Hello ? - Slow night . CORDELlA : Yeah . Maybe Wes or Gunn found something . I know you never said anything that tacky or overt to Fred . But you ' re still gon na have that talk , whether you want to or not . - A talk with Fred ? - Yes . Just keep it simple . One , you ' re not like other men . Two , there 's no room at work for romance . Romance with Fred ? So I 'm a ... ? Obviously . Get some rest . See you tomorrow .  CORDELlA : You 've reached Angel Investigations . Leave a message . OLD ANGEL : Cordelia , are you there ? Pick up . Angel , how 's my head ? Hope you put ice on it . Sweet deal you got here . Love the hotel . And Cordelia ... . - That 's how I spell W-O-M-A-N . - Where is she ? You just worry about eating nice , soft food and staying out of Ryan 's way . - You ' re not to be out of your room . - I ' m stretching my legs . RYAN : Who am I ? You 're Ryan . At least you 're not having an episode . Marcus , you think you 're a 24-year-old stud or a famous skateboarder keep it to yourself unless you wan na wake up in restraints again . - Copy ? - I know who I am . Then let 's get you back to beddy-bye . Angel . What happened ? Hey , doll . I was working on the case . I must 've dozed off . - T oo tired to go up to your room ? - My room ? Right , which is upstairs . You know me . I was giving 1 00% . What did I do with that case file ? - You gave it to me yesterday . - Must be getting old . Not until you have that talk with Fred .  There 's something about brewed tea you can not replicate with a bag . CORDELlA : Do n't avoid the talk . I know . I know . I know . - Hey , how you doing ? - All right . Well ... . You ? So we got ta talk . I got nothing against you personally . It 's just ... . This will be harder than I thought . I do n't know how to spit this out . Angel . - Whatever it is , I 'm here for you . - Yeah , that may be the problem . I mean , whatever we had , whatever we did . I just think that we should keep that behind us . Start from scratch . You know , two men working side by side but , you know , none of that funny stuff . Shake on that ? I guess . - All right , give me a hug . CORDELlA : Wesley , food 's here . WESLEY : Okay . - Wesley ? - Yes ? - Do you know where Fred is ? - Up in her room . GUNN : Breakfast burritos all around . - Thanks , bro . Keep the change on that . - Okay . - Get anything from the hotel ? GUNN : Yeah , I did . These guys ran up huge bills , mostly alcohol . At least they went out partying . I got their phone bills . Is n't that illegal ? I mean , do n't these guys deserve a little privacy ? - What ? - Why are you eating ? - I ' m hungry . WESLEY : They called the same number . I checked it out . First Class Escorts , La Brea and 6th . Escorts ? You mean hookers ? I should interview them while the trail is hot . I 'll take this . You interview the hotel staff . GUNN : I figured it out . - I 'll interview the hookers . - Are there any men who are n't dogs ? - Not very many . A woman is more than a piece of meat . I can see one of the bodies . Gunn can go with you . That was n't the kind of body I had in mind to see . We ' re going , we 're going . You know , that 's a great idea . I 'll just stay here hold the fort , keep an eye on the evidence . WOMAN : Okay , Mom . security GUARD : Let me get that . WOMAN : Thank you . security GUARD : There you go . WOMAN : Great . security GUARD : I 'll take it . WOMAN : Great , thank you . OLD MAN : Yeah . over there . Let 's go . MAN : Okay . - I got someone I want you to meet . - I ca n't right now . This is my baby granddaughter , Katrina . Girl 's gon na rule the world . Is n't she something ? She 's beautiful .  FRED : What you doing ? Well . Hey , sweetheart ... . Fred . Have I ever told you you 're a very beautiful woman ? Um , no . Do you like olives ? I got work to finish up here . Go up and put on something pretty , and we 'll go out on the town . - Really ? - And that 's just for starters . Okay . I 'll be - - I 'll just go and-- Okay !  What can I do for you ? Do n't go all night-stalker on me . I 'm here to do you a favor . We both agreed that business with Cordelia was just business , right ? Sure . It 's all there : earthquake-safe certification statement of asbestos-level compliance , all of it . I ' m not playing you here . It 's not about you . It 's about Gavin . Thinks he 's so smart . You 're welcome . I 'm sorry . Thanks . That was a really thoughtful favor . My heart . - Want another ? LlLAH : I 'll have to call a taxi as it is . Oops . - What do you want ? - You . Do n't tell me you never thought about it .   LlLAH : Son of a bitch ! Sorry , it felt like the thing to do . - Are you born-again ? - I do n't know what game this is . But I hope you enjoyed it . You 'll never get this close to me again . What ? This is new . What are - - ? Ah . What the - - ? RYAN : You 're awake . OLD ANGEL : It 's beating . - lt was your fourth heart attack . You ca n't survive another one . You got lucky . Try something like that again , you may not be . Julia Roberts ever makes a realistic movie about being an escort I think it should be called Pretty Skanky Woman . I always forget to knock because , you know , I did n't have a door for so long . He called me sweetheart . But it 's just an expression , is n't it ? When a waitress calls you honey , it does n't mean you 're special . It 's just a word , right ? Sweetheart . Is this about Angel ? He talked to you , did n't he ? This is all my fault . I told him to do that . You told him to make out with that woman on the desk ? What ? No . What woman ?   My boyfriend 's probably looking for me . He could catch us at any moment . Sort of makes it more exciting , does n't it ? Yeah . It does . boyfriend : Hey ! - What the hell you think you 're doing ? - He bit me ! boyfriend : Freak !  Nice ! - Bring it on . I 'll be young , handsome and strong forever . There 's just one thing I got ta do first .  I do n't believe it . On my desk ? Well , it did used to be his . He was just kind of reclaiming it . WESLEY : How ? By marking it ? - This is n't like him . - This is totally like him . - Doing the dance with a cheap blond . - Brunette . She was a cheap brunette . - You 're right . This is n't like him . - So who was she ? It does n't matter who she was . The question is , who is he ? We 're all thinking it . - He 's Angelus again . - Who 's Angelus ? The badass vamp Angel turns into . But then why is n't there a body here ? That 's not what I meant . Why would Angel need to read about vampires ? - He wouldn't . They were n't themselves . Angel 's infected by whatever got into them ? Not whatever , whomever . At the gym , anything unusual happen to Angel ? Not really . I was with him pretty much the whole time . Except when he went to the -- JACKSON : Hey . What are you doing out of bed ? Are you trying to bust loose again ? Damn , Marcus . You do n't quit , do you ? You wan na have another heart attack ? Look , I ca n't really explain this , but I need to get out of here . Just do n't turn me in . Not gon na have to . Your kid 's signing in at reception . OLD ANGEL : My kid ? - Uh-huh . FAKE ANGEL : Have a good night . RYAN : Good night . Hi , Dad .  You finally found a body that wo n't burn out , huh ? Looks like . You sure ? I do n't think you know what you 're getting into . I know . You do n't seem to know what you had . You were the worst vampire . Vampires do n't help people , moron , they kill them . - Here , let me show you . - You may have the attitude and power . But there 's one thing you do n't have and never will : friends . Four of them behind you with heavy things . He 's the one that 's been casting that spell . You 're Angel ? With that cologne ? I do n't think so . Do n't stake him . God , I love technology . Are you all right ? I got ta pee . Did you see an Algurian conjuring orb ? Could 've been glowing . In his room . On a shrine . I was right . Algurian body-switching spell . Keep an eye on him . Fred ! He 's out . He 's out . Read this . - You ca n't take that ! - You do n't deserve that body ! - I was gon na say the same to you . I 'll tell you why you have a weak heart , Marcus . You never use it . You 're pathetic . You 're all path - - ! You should try to keep a lid on that rage . It 's not healthy .  RYAN : What 's going on ? - Dad 's having a bad night . - Hi . - Hi . Hey . How 's your head ? Sorry about all that . I gather I had it coming . Yes . I 've been meaning to talk to you about something . Uh-huh . Okay . Is this about how you 're not like other men what , with that curse and all ? And how you 're really fond of me , but that 's as far as it goes ? Uh ... . Yeah . Cordelia explained it to me . She said you 'd probably just screw it up . What ? It 's like something out of Fitzgerald . The man who can have everything but love . Well , maybe in some ways , you 're better off , because love is ... . Well , in a way , it 's everything . But it 's also heartache and disappointment . And those are good things to avoid .  Angel , Willow 's on the phone . She 's alive . Buffy 's alive 
@@5244441 Previously on " Royal Pains " ... Of course I 'm upset at situation . We 've been evicted . - Hello , Hank . - Hi , Charlotte . Rafa 's filed a lawsuit . He 's no longer asking for joint custody .  Now he wants sole custody . Divya ! Raj ? Oh ... -  : Oh , my gosh . - Ah . So what did your lawyer say ? She 's working on a visitation plan for Rafa , visitation on U.S . soil only . I 've got a brilliant divorce attorney , - if you need a second opinion . - Raj , I am so sorry it did n't work out . I am purchasing Hamptons Heritage . I would like all of you to serve on the hospital 's board of directors . - You ready ? - I am .  : Hank ? - I need you . - Boris , Charlotte - and I were just going to ... - Now .  Where ... Median sternotomy .  Hank , I am so sorry , but I need you . Divya , I 'm kind of in the middle of something . Now ! Hank ? She was in the motorcade when it struck the basketball court . - Okay , uh , turn this way . -   Thank you .  : Come on , stay with me , babe . Evan ? What the hell happened ? He was trying to talk his way into the motorcade , which is why it crashed into the basketball court . Really , Evan ? Again ? Why am I always cleaning up your messes ? Keep pumping , babe . Oh , my God , such a beautiful ring . Charlotte ! Charlotte ? Charlotte ! Charlotte ! Charlotte !  - Mm . - What 's wrong ? Oh . Uh ... I just , uh ... I just had a really weird nightmare . Aww . About what ? Um ... Yeah , I thought so too , but ... I do n't know , maybe I 'm more annoyed than I thought . What are you annoyed about ?  About the fact that Boris called for a board meeting for tomorrow .  I want to be with you on your last day in town . All day . And I want it to be ... perfect . It will be , as long as I get my eight hours of sleep , or else you 'll have a real nightmare on your hands .  - Okay ? - Okay . Do n't worry , the administrator here is insanely efficient . Like , Boris does n't even come to the meetings anymore . So it 'll be , like , an hour , tops . Great . Why are you so pressed for time , anyway ? I want to spend every last second I can with Charlotte before she leaves . Hey , hey , uh ... I 'm sorry you and I have n't hung out much lately , which is why I have n't had a chance to tell you something important . Can we talk if and when this meeting ever ends ? I can save you the time , Hank . I did n't forget what we talked about when you joined the board , okay ? We will watch each other 's backs , and I will make sure you do n't get pulled any deeper into this commitment . - Thank you , Evan . - Yeah . Means a lot to hear you say that . Really , but that 's not at all what I wanted to talk to you about . Hmm . - Hey ! - Hey . How was the new lawyer ? I wish she was n't necessary . I wish that Rafa and I had been able to work it out when he was here last week , but the custody battle for Sashi is now in very capable hands . Agreed . Where 's Jeremiah ? He had to go to Philadelphia to interview research candidates for the lab , but he gave me his proxy . Why do n't I get his proxy ? Why would he give you his proxy ? - Because he and I are ... - Both doctors ? Highly intelligent ? You know what , enjoy your voting power , Divya . Just do n't you dare use it against me . Boris , you 're here . Indeed , and I suggest we begin . There 's much to discuss . So the first order of business is to name an interim replacement for the hospital administrator . What ? Yeah , what happened to the one we have ? Had . He quit . Something about an opportunity closer to home . Huh ... he seemed so committed to the job . We need someone reliable who is familiar with the inner workings of the hospital , someone ... trustworthy . - Mr . Yes , I am . You are ? I am sensitive to spreading HankMed too thinly . No , no , we can handle it . We 're HankMed . Congratulations , then . Ev , I 'm really proud of you . Seriously , Boris is not an easy guy to impress . Thanks , Hank . It means a lot hearing you say that . Really . Whoever would have thought I 'd end up with Jill 's job ? Just try not to fall for me , okay ? - That would be really weird . - Okay , I 'll try . It 'll be hard . - Hey , can we , uh ... - What ? Have that chat now ? Yeah , sure . Yeah , just step into my interim hospital administration office , which is probably , uh , where do you think that is ? I think it 's that one . It 's nice . It 's right next to the corner suite . It 's locked .  . So ...  . You know , I still ca n't figure out the meaning of a motorcade crashing into a basketball court . I just , I do n't ... Mm , no , that one would stump even Freud . - Yeah . -  Seriously , I ... I have cherished every single day we 've shared . Even that very rough week we spent in the hills overlooking Monaco . Yeah , we have survived a lot together . Yes , we have . Charlotte , I wanted to , um ... Thank you . For opening me up to feelings I have n't had in a very long time . For ... making me look forward to something beyond just the start of summer . And , well , I 'd like to make that feeling last . For good . Charlotte ... will you marry me ? Um ... Hank ... Oh . What you did was ... crazy and impulsive . I misread her . I misread us , and I blew it . Well , for good ? We had a brutally awkward ride to JFK . And when we said good-bye , I could just ... I could just tell . This time , she is n't coming back . What makes you so sure ? She said she 'd just gotten her vision back , she was traveling nonstop to expand her business , and , get this , we had n't been seeing each other that long anyway . She 'd been seeing you even less . - Sorry . - Everything felt so good , Ev . And ... and somehow I just ... I made it all go bad . Well , look on the bright side . You 've been consumed by this relationship , Henry . Like , consumed . Now you have time to catch up on all the things you 've been neglecting . - Yeah . - Yeah . Like what ? Like ... Me . " Mozel Tav " ! Close enough . Not really . We can pick up the keys right now . The keys to our new house . Congrats , guys . Owning your first home together is a huge milestone . Would you give us one second ? We were just having a conversation . No , it 's okay , Ev . I 'm good . We 'll talk later . Go pick up the keys . " Mozel Tav . " - Okay , come on . - All right .  Hi , Ms . Newberg . My favorite first responders . So good to see you . Please .  : Thank you . Oh , what 's this ?  : The next episode of 52 Parties . - No way , I love that show . - How many what now ? What show ? What are we talking about ? It 's ... it 's a new reality show on Bravo . There 's Aubrey Wolfhouse . She 's the anti-Martha Stewart . It 's not about making it perfect . It 's about knowing it wo n't be .  : The party must go on . -  - Okay . Well , how did you get her to film here ? Well , let 's just say Andy Cohen owes me a favor . Aubrey is helping me throw a welcome party for my new neighbor , Muggsy . His name is Muggsy ? Did he move here from the 1920s underworld ? Apparently , he 's very sweet . That 's all I know . That and the fact that he gave me and Aubrey a great excuse for a party .  : Let 's go in tight on the trimming . Here comes our Emmy . What exactly is wrong with her ? She looks pretty healthy to me . Well , I did n't call you about her . Oh , you look very healthy too , Ms . Newberg . I feel healthy . I have a feeling I 'm not gon na want to hear too much more about it . Our time together is so special . Exhausting , really , if you know what I mean . We do , we do . But when I got back home , I realized there was pink in my tink . Huh . Blood in your urine . Ahh . Yes , um , any pain ? Well , I am a little sore . I was up there for three days , and nobody goes to Buffalo for the sightseeing , if you know what I ... Yes , we know exactly what you mean . Ms . Newberg , it 's probably a bladder infection . We 'll get a urine sample and prescribe you some antibiotics .  And this is why you should wear gardening gloves when you do this . You pricked yourself with a thorn ? I trimmed myself with the shears . Can I take a look ? Okay . Not too bad .  : Okay . Ahh . Okay , put me down , so I can go run around .  Do you believe this place is actually ours ? Uh , financially , the evidence is pretty convincing , so yeah . Babe , do n't rain on this . I 'm not , I 'm not ... I 'm sorry , I am not . I ... it is amazing . It 's truly amazing . - Is n't it perfect ? - And it 's ours . - This is our house . - I know . - I mean , look at our floors . - Look at our fireplace ! Look at ... oh , my God , loot at our wet bar ! Yeah , that wet bar is going straight to wet bar heaven . I thought I 'd slip that one through while you were excited . Aside from that , this place needs so little work ... ' cause of the , uh ... time of the month ? I actually have an app . What kind of app ? It 's , you know , it 's just ... just tracks your , uh , cycles . It does what ? It 's called Red Dragon .  Evan , I just ... realized I 'm late . You mean the dragon 's still in the castle ? Yeah , and I 'm never late . You 're saying you could be ... I mean , we could be ... I do n't know . Probably not . I mean , we ca n't be . Technically , we could be . Right , but what I 'm saying is that we just ca n't be . Yeah , ' cause that would be crazy . Yeah . But I think we should go buy a pregnancy test just to be on the safe side . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . I think that would probably void the warranty . Are ... are you sure you want this on camera ? Mm-hmm . Oh , I have had a lot more mishaps than usual lately . Fortunately , it 's all very on-brand . - Huh ? - Welcome to reality TV . Thanks for being game . Welcome to medicine in the Hamptons .  You know , you are super telegenic with that killer smile and hair that could lift a car . Just curious , are you single ? Uh , I do n't want to bore your viewers with my personal life . - Hmm . - So why 52 Parties ?  : I did have a much cooler name , but the network made me change it . No , I meant the number , not the name . Ah , well , hosting is nerve-racking . Even just a dinner party or having a few friends over for some binge watching ... Do you host a lot of parties ? Do staff meetings count ?  So you plan all week , wanting everything to be perfect , but inevitably , something will go wrong , and some people hit those hurdles and they give up . They think they 're not cut out for it , but you got ta make the mistakes part of the fun . The party must go on . And you go right into the next party and then the one after that ... And then 49 more . Have one very fun year . And one very clever TV show . Aw . Although I 'm not sure overcoming life 's hurdles is that easy . Well , about 1.2 million 18- to 49-year-olds want to believe that it is . All right , sounds like you got a hit on your hands . I was just as surprised as anyone . Of course , now the pressure is on to deliver big for season two . Huh ... the nerves . - Huh . - Look what I 've got . And there 's plenty more where this came from . Please tell me that 's not your sample . Oh , no , no . I 've got that . No , this is the greatest ros ? in the world . Want some ? No . Bye , Divs ! Hank , thanks so much again for coming so quickly . My pleasure , every single time . Now , I 'm going to insist that you charge me this time , at least until your father makes an honest woman out of me , so we are officially family . Sorry , no deal . Well , then , you and Charlotte must come to my welcome party , so I can spoil you both with champagne , caviar , and a TV camera in your face . Uh , I do n't think that 'll be possible , but I 'll see if Divya 's available . She 's a big fan of Aubrey . They always hurt . Every single time . So then ... fess up . Things between Charlotte and me ended last night . - Ohh , Hank . - Oh , look ! I have my next patient now , but thank you so much for your concern , Ms . Newberg . You are the best . You know what , let 's do another . Just to be sure , yeah ? That was another . That was the third another . Evan , we 're sure . Hmm . Do n't you have a meeting at the hospital ? Yeah , but I also ... I also have this . And , obviously , this is big news . Big . But you still have your job . Your big , new , very important job . Right .   We 're not ready , uh , at all . We do n't have a crib . I do n't even know anything about any of that stuff . We 're gon na have to read a lot of books . And the house is n't ready . And what about you , should n't you be eating kale ? Or vomiting or both ? I 'm pregnant , not bulimic . Well ... what do we do ? Hey , I 'm freaking out too , believe me . Let 's at least try to freak out together , okay ?  I 'm gon na postpone my meeting , ' cause I can do that when I 'm the one in charge . I appreciate that . The good news is , we 've got nine months to adjust to this . So let 's just take some time to process it . Okay .  Yeah . So this is really your office ? You find it lacking in some manner ? No , no . Just does n't seem ... Boris-y . No , I 'm here to follow up on your dizzy spell during the meeting . Yes , that would have been my next guess . Any other episodes lately ? Perhaps one or two . Okay , I 'd like to do a neuro exam . I imagine you would . Wait . Ahh , now there 's the Boris I know and love . You may proceed . Okay . Um , follow my finger with your eyes . Good ... stand with your feet together , eyes closed . Palms up . Okay , good . I want to remind you that your clinical trial is only designed ... To stave off symptoms , yes . I recall all the tedious fine print , Hank . Okay , look straight ahead . The treatment only works if you 're rested and otherwise healthy . Now I know this acquisition of the hospital is a major undertaking ... I am not overworking , Hank . Boris , is there more to this acquisition than you 're letting on ? You must n't be so suspicious . Says the man with opaque windows . With Evan at the helm now , I can afford to step back , knowing that things will run smoothly . Are we done ? Yeah . Sure . - Thank you . - Yep . ? So hush , little baby , do n't you cry . Daddy loves you . And so do I ?  : I love you , Sashi . Did Nate take the twins to the park ? He did . Is your next patient still at 2:30 ? Mm-hmm . So what you 're saying is , we have lunch hour all to ourselves again . No kids , no patients . Actual privacy . It seems I have my answer . Okay , well , the antibiotics may need more time to help , but I do n't see anything else more concerning . Newberg , I am fine , I promise . Oh , Hanky-poo ... my brilliant , brilliant , poor boy . Okay . You can put on a brave face , but I know you . You are too sensitive to be so fine so soon . It 's okay to be hurting . Luckily , I can distract myself with work , like this exam , which would be a lot easier if you would just relax and stop trying to console me , Ms . Newberg . Denial is not your friend , Hank . You have to wallow . Wallowing is a must . You can not just doctor your way around the wallow . Try it . What did you find in the ultrasound ? The ultrasound 's clean . I 'm sad for Hank , not me . - Why for Hank ? - Ms . Newberg , please . Because Charlotte broke his heart . Tell her , Hank . I realized what was missing from our signature cocktail ... ginger . Wait till you taste it now , Ms . Simple and sublime . Ms . Newberg , have you been tasting many of those ? Beets are so healthy , and they make the cocktail so colorful . Yeah , they make other things colorful too . Ms . Newberg , I think we 've diagnosed your ailment . The pink in your tink is from your drink . Huh . Do we need to send you to penmanship camp ? My handwriting 's still not big enough ? It 's actually worse than before . How can your handwriting be getting smaller and smaller ? It ca n't . That 's impossible . Aubrey , have you had any other recent injuries ? Just the usual cuts and scrapes . Comes with the territory . You did mention that you 've been clumsier than usual lately . I have had a few more accidents . Aubrey , when you cut yourself earlier , do you think it was because your hand was shaking ? I 'm not sure . Well , there 's an easy way to find out .  : Look , her fingers . - Pill-rolling tremor . - Mm-hmm . What does that mean ? Maybe nothing , but we should do a couple of tests just to make sure . So I was thinking either , A , there 's electric ... Hello , Ms . Lawson . Hi . Uh , I 'm just about to step into a meeting . What 's going on ? Um , the news we got this morning ? Yeah ? It 's not news anymore . Meaning it 's old news now , or it was inaccurately news , or ... Evan , this would be where you tell me you need a moment with your wife . - Thank you , Boris . - Right , yeah , I ... Think I ... yeah . I 'll just ... I 'll meet you in there . I got my period . False alarm . Yeah , I-I freaked out all morning . I poured cream over my pancakes in the staff lounge . Um , I really have to go do this meeting right now . Yeah , yeah , we 'll still catch up tonight . I just thought maybe you 'd like to have the news right away . - I love you . - I love you . - Okay , I 'll see you tonight . - Okay . Bye . Uh , okay , um , I 'll send this to radiology to rule out any thromboembolic events or hydrocephalus , but your CT looks normal . That 's a relief . I 'll also draw blood to rule out vitamin deficiencies or any infection that could explain your tremors . Okay . Is that it ? For now , yeah , but we 'll have to take this one step at a time . Okay . Oh , that 's okay . I was feeling you out for Becki . - Becki ? - Mm-hmm . Your producer , Becki ? She thinks you 're hot . In case you did n't notice her checking you out . Yeah , no , I-I did n't notice that . You should get in there , Hank . She 's a lot of fun , she has a place out here , and she 's weirdly down to earth for someone who works in TV . Uh , listen , that 's flattering . It 's just really bad timing for me . Totally get it . I am sorry for overstepping . No , not at all . And , look , I appreciate that your " get right back on the horse " philosophy is n't limited to hosting parties . I just ... I need a little more time . Of course , whatever works for you . Thank you . - Hey . - Hey . Thinking about Charlotte ?  - Actually , no . - It 's okay . If ... if you do n't want to talk about it , I-I totally understand . And if you do n't feel like partying either , I could check up on Aubrey . We ca n't do anything anyway until her blood work comes back . Aubrey 's blood work is back . It did n't pick up anything . It 's very unusual in someone your age , and it 's a diagnosis of exclusion . That means we arrive at it by eliminating all other possible causes . Okay . But given your test results and the distinctive tremor in your hand , Aubrey , it seems likely that you 're in the early stages of Parkinson 's disease . What ? I do n't un ...  . Hello from the Hamptons , and welcome to another episode of 52 Parties , guest starring me . Are you nervous ? Have you never performed on TV before ? Well , actually , I played 14 years in the NBA . Ohh , you 're sweet and funny ! Well , you will be a very welcome edition to the neighborhood , Muggsy . Well , thank you . Oh , hi . Good to see you .  : Hey . - Any luck ? - No , but her car is in the driveway . Okay , I 'll check with Newberg again . Okay , good .  . Hey , Hank . Have you seen Aubrey ? I was just gon na ask you the same thing . Any idea where she could be ? No . She likes to run around trying to find new blooper possibilities . Speaking of , I know Aubrey gave you my number , but I just want to say there 's totally no pressure . Oh , okay , thank you ... Oh . There 's Aubrey . Um , how about I talk to her , then you talk to her ? Then you and I finish talking to each other ? - Sounds good . - I 'll see you later . Hey . You must be feeling pretty overwhelmed right now . I am . That 's completely normal . Anything I can help clarify ? To be honest , I did n't hear much after the word " Parkinson 's . " And that 's normal too . So how about we start from scratch ? I 'd appreciate that . Okay . Parkinson 's is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects your movement . And there is no cure ?  Not yet . Not yet . But there are medications that can help manage the symptoms , and new treatments are being made available as we speak . Like what ? Like deep brain stimulation , stem cell therapy , clinical trials . Listen , I 'll find you a great specialist and help in any other way I can . We 'll navigate this together . It just sucks that I have to quit the show . I barely started it . You do n't have to quit . We do n't know how your symptoms will progress . Maybe you could just take it one party at a time . I do n't think America wants to watch me shaking and trembling . It 's not why they tune into my show . Overcoming obstacles with a positive attitude . That 's why America tunes into your show . Right ? Yeah .  . I have to say , that Aubrey is pretty impressive . - Inspiring , even . - No question . And it looks like your pep talk got her back on her feet again . I think she would have gotten there on her own . That determination is just part of who she is . But I realize now , she was right . Charlotte was n't the right person for me , because we were in such completely different places in our lives . She was discovering the world all over again , and I was ready to be in love , you know , ready to settle down . So I jumped in , both feet , with the first person I really liked . Sounds like you felt your biological clock ticking . And that is definitely not the right way to find the right person . But Charlotte helped me realize that I 'm ready to find that right person , whoever she is . I mean , the party must go on , right ? Does this mean you 'll be going on 52 dates then ?  - If that 's what it takes . - Hmm ... I 'm having mixed feelings about our false alarm . I mean , I think about what we could be celebrating right now and ... And you feel disappointed ? Yeah . Does n't sound so mixed . And to be honest , I 've been having similar not-so-mixed feelings . Like when I went into the hospital for that meeting , I ... I could n't concentrate on anything , I was just ... I was flat-out sad .  So are you saying ... I mean , I 'm ... I did n't even know it until ... until we were having one and then we were n't , but ... I want a baby . I want a baby too . I really want a baby . Okay , do n't get competitive .   : Oh , my God . And then this place will be heaven .  What the hell was that ? Mm , okay , do n't freak out , but that was a snake . What ? No .  - Hey , hey ! - Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! I thought we agreed you were n't gon na freak out . You were calmer when you thought I was pregnant . Why is there a snake in our house ? Um , I do n't know . Probably when you started the fire , he was like , uh , there 's a fire in here , I 'm out . Can you stop being such a sympathizer , please ? This is a home invasion . There 's a snake in our house ! On the count of three , we 're gon na walk calmly upstairs and call for help . - Okay . - Ready ? One ...  Two , three ... hey , what 's going on ? We 're so sorry to intrude , but could we spend the night ? We 're having a problem at our new place . Uh , yeah , I guess you can . What kind of problem ? Multiple problems . Long , slimy , slithering problems , falling from our chimney ... our chimney , Henry . Nothing is sacred to these demons . Oh , are you expecting company ? Uh , I am , actually . Yeah , I am expecting company . Oh . Wha ... already ? Is n't rushing into things what got you into this situation in the first place ? I 'm not rushing into anything . It 's dinner , that 's it . I 'm having dinner tonight anyway . Why not have it with company instead of alone ? I 'm moving forward at some point . Why not start right now ? - Just do n't ... - Do n't worry . I wo n't propose . As am I . Can you believe I slept till 7:00 a.m . today ?  : Well , enjoy every second of it . I hope you have good news by the time I return . Yeah , I 'm at my lawyer 's office now to drop off the custody agreements . Good luck . Talk to you later . Okay , bye . Be right back , Bunny .  Hey , Sashi . Somebody needs Mama 's help . I 'll be right back , okay ? I love you .   Sir , I 'm a physician assistant . I 'm gon na take a look at your head wound , okay ?  Okay , you 're choking on something , and I 'm gon na get it out . Come on . I 'll need to dislodge it manually .  . Bubble gum .  Sir ? Sir , can you tell me your name ? - Joey . You 'll need a work-up at the hospital to check for a concussion or any other head injuries . Yes , hi , this is Divya Katdare . I am outside South Fork Historical Society . I 'm with a male in respiratory distress . I need an ambulance straightaway . Thank you . I 'll be right back . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me , what ... Hey , what are you guys doing ? That is my daughter . Then you must be the one who endangered her health and broke the law by leaving her unattended in your vehicle . What ? No . I 'm gon na need to see some ID . - Okay . Okay . -  Ugh , look . I ... I 'm a physician assistant , and I was responding to an emergency right over there ... Damn it , I told him to stay there . He ... Hey ! Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Wait , you can not just take my child . Child Protect ... what ? Hey , hey , just get your ... get your hands off me ! Ma'am . Sashi , honey , Mama 's right here . - You 're under arrest . - What ? -  - Sashi , Mommy 's right here . Do n't worry , honey , I 'm right here .  . 
@@5244741       ANNOUNCER : Welcome to this week 's special episode of American Dicks . As you know , detectives profiled in this program have solved 99 cases in a row - - a perfect record achieved with only a minimal amount of altered facts , network-funded bribery and threats of bodily harm to friends and families of the suspects . Tonight , then , we attempt to solve our 100th case in a row . Unfortunately , a detectives ' strike is sweeping the nation and we 've been able to find only one detective who was seduced enough by the potential notoriety to scab . DUCKMAN : Fluffy , Uranus , where the  is my coffee ? Do n't you  realize I want my  coffee first thing every  morning . If I do n't  get it now I 'm going to kick your furry little  out of here , so give me the  coffee ! Oh . Heh-heh . I mean , I should 've been the first show , not the hundredth ! I 'm telling you , I do n't need this kind of treatment from some cheap , jump-on-the-reality-show bandwagon schlockumentary . Not that it 's changed my opinion of your fine program one iota . I 'm proud to be part of your uncompromising quest for truth and justice . Did I ever tell you how much I admired the episode where you rigged the dump truck to explode when the kid 's bicycle hit it , so the detective could arrest the manufacturer ?  So , shall we get on with the myth-making ? This is my camera-shy , much less experienced and generally easy-to-ignore partner , Cornfed . Hi , Mom . Hop off the curly-cue , carnie . You and me are heading out to solve American Dicks ' 100th case . Not to worry . Only a matter of time before the big ones start pouring in .  As promised . URANUS : Mr . Duckman , your carton of itch-away rectal cream just arrived and your test results are here . The doctor has n't identified your lesions but he 's ruled out cold sores . Before I met Duckman , I was at a crossroads , soul-searching , looking for my place in this endless puzzle we call life . You ever wake up in a Cambodian gaming parlor and realize you were living in a dark , dank abyss of emptiness and loneliness , then wander the mountains of Asia for two years until you became the chef in a Tibetan monastery ? I just asked what kind of detective Duckman is . Oh . I have some clothes in the dryer .  Wake up , Mr . Cameraman . What ? What ? What ? What ? What ? What ? FLUFFY AND URANUS : Mr . Duckman ! Wha-what ? Right . Amazing how fast two days of waiting for a case can go by . URANUS : Mr . Duckman , you 've got a case on line one . A case ? ! Me ? ! I mean , of course I have a case . Why would n't I have a case ?  I 'm just surprised by the way he said it . Here , let me get that for you .  Duckman Investigations - - what can I do for you ? Solve a murder ? Track down an international terrorist ? Recover millions of dollars worth of stolen jewelry ? FEMALE : I need you to get my cat down from a tree . I live at Fourth and Elm . Fourth and Elm . Got it ! We got a 405 , Corny . Code Red ! Oops , I forgot the rubber mouse and ball of string . Fluffy , Uranus , hold my calls . I 'm about to become the most famous detective in town by solving ... Ah , you 're sweet . Sweetest , little , ooh .  What 's that ? Oh , it 's a kitty cat , we found on our way to work . At Fourth and Elm . Uh ... Does that count ? How is he as a father ? Ha ! Last week he converted the twins ' stock dividends into singles , and blew the whole thing at that Live Nude Amazons bar by the airport .  I knew that  did n't quit smoking . You know how tough it is raising kids with a role model like that feathered weasel ? Well , the women out there know what I mean . Actually , our audience is mostly men between the ages of 20 and 55 . Oh , did I mention I 'm a gourmet cook , and I 'm about to have more than half my visible cellulite surgically removed .  Heh-heh-heh . Sinus itch . So , uh , while we 're here perhaps a lesson or two . One thing that separates the great detectives from the slouches is the ability to recognize an opportunity . You 've got to help me . My husband , Mayor Whitman , has disappeared . Yeah , right , right . A man needs a break once in a while . Huh ? Maybe there 's a marriage counselor in the Yellow Pages . Eh , where was I ?  Ah , yes . Sizing up an opportunity and seeing it for what it is . No , no . I need a detective . With this strike going on , I ca n't find one anywhere . Hey , put a sock in it , lady . Uh , Duckman ? You 're going to interrupt me too ? !  Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . Hmm ? Uh , no , Cornfed , we ca n't take lunch yet . I have an intuitive sense that this woman may have a case . Well , lady , are my razor-sharp instincts correct ? I 've been trying to tell you - - my husband disappeared - - Mayor Whitman . Mayor Whitman ! The man who brought honesty and fairness to municipal politics ? The man who cleansed city hall of corruption . The man I voted for six times last election ? Any suspects ? Well , there 's Le Francis - - Lance Le Francis . He manages the baseball star Honiss Rhodes . I think money could be a motivating factor here . You 're right . Le Francis owed taxes to the city . I mean , for me . How much cash you willing to cough up ? I 'll pay you $5,000 . Reflex . Five thousand , huh ? Make it ten , you got a deal . Five . Nine . Eight . Five . Seven . Five . Six . Five . Five , but that 's as low as I 'll go . Four . Deal ! I 'll take the case if we 're not booked up . Cor-nay , would you mind checking my book ? You 've got your 50th high school reunion in June of 2021 . Before that , we 're clear . From the moment a case begins , I get into a mode of heightened reality , hyper-perceptive to every single thing that goes on around me , like an owl scouting its prey , sensing it , finding it , then moving in for the ... Corny , you remember where I parked ? Ook-lay ehind you-bay . Heh-heh . Nice job , Corny . I like to devise little games to keep Cornfed sharp . BERNICE : Duckman ! There you are . I 've been looking everywhere for you . Oh , my heavens ! Now ! DUCKMAN : Bernice , what the .. ? Look , aliens are stealing that baby ! As I was saying , I was just catching up on one of my many and varied leisure time activities . Favorite hobbies include drag racing , ancient Greek philosophy , and snorkeling , which , by the bye , has resulted in an almost superhuman capacity for breath control , when I remembered I had something urgent to do . I have something urgent to do too . I 'm about to solve the 100th case on American Dicks . Tell her , Corny . Define " about to solve . " Hey , want to see my abscessed tooth ? CAMERAMAN : Hey , what are you .. ? What 's this button do ? CAMERAMAN : Keep your hands off of that , you little  ! Here , let me get that wire for you . Bernice , do n't you realize how much this case will do for me ? It will make me somebody . That 's not the only reason I 'm here . You promised to spend an afternoon with the children . Yeah , sure , before they get married . Do I .. ? I mean , they 're so busy with school and all . Look , Bernice , I ca n't take them now . Think about someone besides yourself for once . And do n't forget Charles and Mambo 's recital Friday , either . Ta-ta !  CAMERAMAN : Out of the way ! I was here first . Sorry , we got jurisdiction here . We 're on a major network . Oh . DUCKMAN : What the hell 's going on ? ! You 're under arrest , Duckman .  ... Let me try it again . You 're under arrest , Duckman . You have the right to remain silent . You have some other rights too which they 'll dub in at editing . Let 's go . Wait , guys ! You ca n't do this to me . Are you goons listening to me ? Ooh . Goons ? Just a term of affection from the Latin - - goonar , " to like . " The nightsticks are just for show , right ? Well , I 'm sure we 'll be out of here and back on the case faster than you can say plea bargain . They obviously got the wrong guy . I 'm a good citizen . I pay taxes , well , sales tax , except on the stereo stuff I buy from those two discount guys in the ski masks .  I hereby call this court to order . And welcome some very special guests and close personal friends . American Cops , American Dicks , American Stenographers , American Court Janitors , and of course , our very own Slap-Happy Singleton . First on the docket , the case of the City ... C-I-T-Y , city , city , city , yay ! Woof ! Woof ! Woof ! ... versus Duckman .  Mr . Your Honor , please ? Ca n't you just let me off with a warning ? I 'll go to a few traffic classes , become a better driver by watching all those movies of people flying through their windshields . Yes , well , uh , I suppose I could let you off . AJAX : Way to go , Dad . He did n't even nail you for that expired license . Or when you backed that manure spreader next to his car and emptied it into his sunroof , the last time he gave you a ... That Duckman ! Thanks , kids . You little  . I sentence you to five years in prison without parole , without cable TV , without ... Wait a minute . Are you Cornfed Pig ? Ernie " Flipper " Davenport , Navy Seals , Third Division . Corny , you old hog ! How are you ? Oh , same old , same old . You know this clown ? He 's my boss . Penalty reduced to a fine of $500 or three days in jail . I do n't have $500 ! I ca n't go to jail now ! Look , I do n't suppose you could float me a few C-notes till I crack this case ? Ow ! Where you going ? We 're both mature , sensible adults here . Why do n't we just turn this pesky little camera off and have a rational discussion . Please , please , please ! You got to bail me out ! I 'll do anything for you ! I 'll scrub the backs of your knees ! I 'll peel the corns off your toes with my teeth ! I 'll even hand wash you ! I did turn that thing off , right ? Actually , you hit the tint button . Oh .  I guess you 'll cut that out too . Thanks for the loan , although I still think mowing your lawn for five years is a little excessive . Look , kids , I 'm doing this for you . Aside from the incredible fame and celebrity I 'll get from the exposure , some of this reward money will go to your college educations . You know , your old dad can only go so far in teaching you all the important things you need to know in life . Hey , Dad , I can belch my name better now .  : Ajax . Still not hearing that second syllable , son . I think we have the best dad in the world , except maybe for my friend Peter 's dad who buys him things , or Nurya 's dad who has six fingers . My dad swatted my face with a broom once . Of course , I was eating from the dustpan at the time .  Okay , kids , be careful , This is obviously a seedy area . Mrs . Whitman said Honiss Rhodes is signing autographs down here . Now I know , he can lead us to Le Francis . I have a sixth sense about the criminal element . That 's right , if there 's the fetid funk of crime within a mile of here , I 'll sniff it out . Hey , punk , you pay for that candy ?   Guilty conscience .  Sorry . My gastriacis acts up whenever I have n't eaten all day . Oh , gum ! There 's Honiss now . Time to take out the trash . Hey ! He 's your biggest fan . If you could just sign his oxygen tank " Keep on fighting , little slugger . This one 's going extra innings . " It would make his day . That 's five bucks a word for the inscription and ten for the signature . Oh . All right , bat boy ... bat boy . All right , stay here , kids . No telling what to expect . What do you say , Le Francis , pay or play ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . Oh , no ? Well , perhaps this will refresh your memory . What does a Polaroid of you handing dollar bills to half-naked Amazons have to do with anything ? Oh . Wrong picture . That 's Mayor Whitman . Guilty as charged ! Yeah . You can have all the technology in the world , but what it comes down to each and every time is gut instinct . Help ! I 'm the mayor ! They 're trying to kidnap me ! Help ! Uh , Duckman ... Not now , Corny . I 'm having a moment . Kids , come here and share the limelight with your old man - - the best detective this fair city has ever known . Duckman , the mayor ... Yeah , I like the sound of that . Duckman , the mayor .  Oh , that mayor .    Something 's wrong here . Where the hell 's my car freshener ? ! Oh . Never mind . Here it is . You know , kids , once I solve this case , your pop will probably be the most important detective ever on this show . What do you think about that , Corny ? You 're working for the biggest American dick ever . AJAX : Hey , quit pushing me . Then move your carcass . What 's a carcass ? Protozoa brain . Double bill . All right , knock it off , or I 'll send you back to your biological parents .     Dad , Dad . It 's the camera guy . Ooh , look . A chocolate bar .  Help ! AJAX : Eww ... this is n't a chocolate bar . Their Aunt Bernice came by to pick them up . I begged them to stay . They 're so much fun to have around . Dad , if you 're going to kick us out at least give us cab fare ! There you are ! Corny ! Hey , why do n't you tell them all the great detective stuff I did while he was gone . Well , he interviewed everyone the mayor has ever known , put a phone tap on his house , checked his credit card receipts for the last 12 months , and snuck off to his favorite topless bar and spent our retainer on table dances . Liar ! You 're right . He did n't do those first three things . Okay , so we 're out of leads . It does n't matter . We masters of the craft find leads where none exist . What , you did n't think I went in there to get a lead , did you ?  The kidnapper 's a Scorpio . Do you happen to know where the mayor is ? No , huh ? Okay . Yeah , is Betty Abagam there ? Dasvidanya , comrade . I 'm through , Corny . Ruined ! Kaput ! A has-been ! A won't-be ! A loser ! I let my kids down . I let you down . I might as well throw away my detective 's license .  I ca n't believe ... Do n't you ever knock ? ! CORNFED : Duckman , take a look at this . Oh , my God ! I ca n't believe it ! I 've been drinking expired milk ! I was referring to this picture of the mayor , bound and gagged , with Le Francis behind him , holding a gun to his head , leading to the conclusion that Le Francis kidnapped the mayor and is keeping him at the dairy he owns -- the same dairy that the mayor wanted to shut down because Le Francis was n't paying any taxes . Uh-huh . Son of a ... All right , this is it . This is what we detectives live for . The big bust ! Pervert ! Look at the size of those udders . That 's our milking area . We milk the cows about once a week so they do n't get sore teats .  Can I help you with something ? Um , we 're with the American Milk Society , and we 're doing a film on , uh ... milking . Mind if we poke around in areas not usually open to people looking for a kidnap victim ? Nah . Go ahead . All right , there you have it . Superior detective skills . That 's what separates the true detectives from the pretenders . The ability to assume a new identity to move in secrecy like a prowler in the night leaving no trail , no scent . MAN : Phone call for private detective ! That 's me ! Hello . Bernice ? ! I told you never to call me ... anywhere ! Yuck ... I know about the recital . I do n't want to miss it . If you 'd get off the phone , maybe I could solve this case and get there on time . I got a hunch I 'm onto something at this dairy . Bernice , I do n't want to let them down ! I know I 'm their only father . I 'm also the only person in the world right now who 's able to save the mayor . See if you can stall the recital for a few minutes . I 'll try to find the mayor . When I do , I 'll be able to buy the boys a hundred pianos . Right , tubas .  CROWD  : Cornfed ! Cornfed ! Of course it was dangerous , Mayor , but that comes with the territory .   WOMAN : That 's the duck who put his face between my breasts . Hey , you ca n't do this ! It 's like I never missed your recital . I tried to make it , kids , honestly I did . You guys know I love you . And to prove it , I got you something . I hope it 's the right size . A sweater ! Who should we thank - - you or the midget who left it at the bus depot ?  I ca n't breathe . Where 's Mambo ? Well , the mayor 's back in city hall and Lance Le Francis is behind bars . And even though I did n't officially solve the case , I had my own reward . Today I learned the importance of being a good father , and that means being around when my bogs need me . Bogs ? That should be boys . You misspelled that on purpose , did n't you ? You 're trying to humiliate me . I tried to have one moment here and you took it away from me . Yoo-hoo ! Mike ? I 'm ready to go . Do n't you have any ethics , any morals , any taste ? Well , I 've about had it with you ! Ever since you got here , you 've been trying to make me look bad . Well , here , how do I look now ? !  Mike ? Mike ? Duckman ! If he ca n't walk out of here on two feet , you wo n't be able to either . Duckman ! Duckman ! Everybody made it . All right . How you doing ? Good . I 'm Keenen Ivory Wayans . This is In Living Color . This is our last show of our first season . We made it through the first one . We want to thank y'all for all the support you gave us . And we 'll be back next time . I got ta say hello to the guys from Orange Drive . Aw , sim . ! Give them a hand . Give it up for ' em . America , you have no id ? ia who the guys from Orange Drive are . But they 're a group of obnoxious , little kids ... We 're gon na have fun tonight . This is our last one . We 're gon na try to go out with a bang . Before we do that , say hello to S.W . One , my D.J . And to the Fly Girls , who promised they wo n't wear any of these outfits next year . Starting over here . Carrie Ann , Deidre ... - Lisa , Michelle . - Lisa . ! Sit for a minute . We 'll be right back . You can do what you wan na do In living color One dollar . Try and dunk the clown . Only one dollar . Try your luck for just a buck . Try your luck . One dollar . Dunk the clown . One ... Try again . One dollar . Dunk the clown . Try again . One dollar . Ei , wait a minute . I just hit the target . That would be pretty funny , hein ? - Sim . - I do n't think so . Homey do n't play that . Homey 's One-stop Carnival . Step right up . Step right up , ladies and gentlemen . Step right up . Are you a real clown ? No , I 'm your daddy . That 's the clown . What can I do for you , little girl ? Can you make me a balloon animal ? Sure . How about a little doggy ? - Sim . - Sim . Homey once had a little doggy just like this . His name was Pal-o-mine . Pet him . Pal-o-mine . P - A-L-O , mine . Used to love to play fetch the stick . Sim . Till one day a cop car came by and ran over his back legs . He ai n't no pal o ' mine no more . - Here you go . - You 're a stupid clown . Sim ? One-stop Carnival . One-stop Carnival . Step right up . Step right up . One dollar . Est ? bem , she 's about ... I 'd say ... one fat bitch . Ei , he 's pretty good . Homey 's One-stop Carnival . Step right up . - Ei , Homey , what 's this ? - That 's the Homey Whirl-Twirl . - Want a ride ? - Sim . One dollar . Have a seat . All right . Round and round you go . Round and round you go . Where you stop , only Homey knows . - Round and round I spin your dumb ass . - Est ? bem , Homey . - You better hang on tight , because you might not last . - Homey , now I am sick . - You said you want to go faster , hein ? - No , Homey ! Round and round you still must go to pay for your sins that kept Homey down so low . So how do you feel about yourself now ? I feel dizzy and nauseous , Homey . Good . Gather round . Pay careful attention , ladies and gentlemen ... ' cause this puppet show has a certain message to it . I want you to meet Mr . Establishment . Say hello to the nice people . Hello , nice people . Now ... tell the nice people how you 've tried to keep Homey down . Well , I 've structured society in such a way ... that men like Homey face nearly impossible odds ... of ever achieving any sort of educational opportunity . Therefore , they 're unable to obtain gainful employment ... thus forcing them to turn to an alternate source of income . Sooner or later , they just end up in jail , just like Homey . That 's right . Now let 's show them how Homey gets back at Mr . Establishment . Shall we ? Sure . Very good . So , what have we learned , if nothing else ? Homey ... do n't play that . Very good . Now take your bow . The end . One dollar . I guess it 's ' cause I have been under a lot of stress and ... maybe I do harbor some misplaced anger , but ... you know , I think most guys do go through this . Am I right , fellas ? This ai n't The Oprah Winfrey Show ? Excuse me . Ei ! So they finally rented that place , hein ? Been about two years . Sure hope that slumlord changed the carpet . It was so stink over there , I could taste it over here . Mm-hmm . Ah , by the way ... I love what you did with those little milk crates ... that little table you made . What 's that , art deco ? Sim . Look at me rattling on and on like you know who I am . Hi , girl . I 'm Bonita Batrell . I 've been here all my life . I know everybody in this neighborhood . Mm-hmm . Sim , girl , there 's some fine people in this neighborhood . There 's a lot of trash too . Mavis ! Ei , I see you got the whole gang out there today , hein ? Them kids look like a pack of rag muffins . Got ta wrap them up in newspaper to take them to Sunday school . Mmm , mm-mmm . You see that little one down there ? That little one . No , the one down there with the snot in his nose . Mm-hmm . That 's my little godson , Chuckie . Ei , Chuckie . Ei , Chuckster . Ei , Chuckie wucky doodle . You gon na give your godmother a kiss ? That 's a little crack addict in the making there . Honey , I 'm telling you . All them kids do is beg . " Give me , " " Loan me , " " Can you spare ? " Every time you turn around . Neither one of them would ever say , " Here , dog . Here 's a bone . She needs some bread . She needs some eggs . She need to take her ass to the supermarket . That 's what she needs to do . Girl , I just do n't understand people like that . ' Cause I 'm trying to better myself . That 's right . I 'm enrolled in the Robert Feon School of Beauty ... and the Ace Truck Driving School . So I 'm gon na have something , you see ? Ei ! There go my home girl , Gretchen . Ei , Gretchen . Ei , girl . I 'm scared of you . You look good . Love what you did with your hair . Shake it , but do n't break it . But if you do , save Chuck a piece . That fool went and spent the baby 's diaper money to get her weave tightened . Girl , the baby was hollering like a banshee all night . I 'm telling you , I 'm glad I ai n't got to worry about that ... Matter of fact , when I was a girl ... my hair was long and straight and black and thick . They used to call me Pocahontas . Then one day I was heating up some ham hocks , and my ponytail caught on fire . Ai n't never come back . Just do n't understan ... Hein ? Ah , ah , ah , him . That 's Mr . Washington down there . Sim , he 's like a father to me . Ei , Daddy Washington . It 's me , your little fuzzy-wuzzy . You lookin ' mighty spry today . Got some spring in your step . Mm-hmm . You 'd have some spring in your step too if you were sleeping with ... the preacher 's 22-year-old daughter . Poor Mrs . Washington . She do n't know what to do with herself . All she do is sit around eating the government cheese and passing gas all day . But I ai n't one to gossip . If anyone asks you , you ai n't heard it from me . No , you have n't . Ah , ah , you got ta ... Look at . There goes Miss Jenkins right there . Mm-hmm . That 's good old Mrs . Jenkins , honey . I dare somebody say something bad about Mrs . Jenkins . Do n't nobody better say nothing bad about Miss Jenkins , ' cause I 'll go crazy . That 's when I 'll lose it . Miss Jenkins is a sterling example of a human being . Mmm , mmm-mmm-mmm . Ei , Miss Jenkins ! She is something else , honey . Just do n't let her take her shoes off in your apartment . Feet smell like a dill pickle . Sim , there 's some nice people in this neighborhood . There 's some fine folks . You gon na like it just fine . You just do me a favor . See you later . You loved him in Police Academy One ... Two , Three , Four ... Five , Six and Seven . Now you can see him live on stage in a special evening of performance entitled ... Michael Winslow : A One Man Show . David Ansen of Newsweek Magazine calls it " Spellbinding .

That 's right . I 've been married for five years ... to a man . I guess I just pictured something other than ... some lazy slob laying around reading Playboys and drinking Black Label . " Morning , honey . Sure wish I could stick around waiting on you hand and foot ... your all day , but one of us has got ta earn a living ! " I tell you . Maybe next time I 'll consider marrying a little higher up on the food chain . Like maybe an amoeba or something . I 'm not bitter though . I love men . I have always loved men . I 'll never forget the first time I fell in love . I was about 18 years old , you know . I 'll never forget it . I was just waiting for the right man to come and sweep me right off my feet . Just sweep me off my feet . Not use me like a Ride at Disney World ! But I still remember the first one . That 's right . Wrote a little song about him . How you doin ' ? I bet you 've been in love , sir . I bet you 've taken some young lady under your arm , sir . I bet you told her you loved her , and she believed you . I 'd like to sing a song that I wrote for my honey lamb . It goes something like this . You desgra ? ad ! You broke my heart ! You said you loved me , you lying son of a bitch ! You lame-ass ! I never felt your ! I never felt your ! You 'll laugh , you 'll gas , you 'll burn in hell . Samantha Kinison . This month on HBO . And now it 's time for another visit with The Buttmans . Ooh , it 's cold out there . Buff ? Honey , are you home ? Hi , dear . I 'm just finishing up in the kitchen . - How was your day ? - Ah , terrible . I 've got a splitting headache . Ah , whoo . Ah , that 's awful . - Here . - Ah , thanks , hon . Let me massage your temples . Aw . - Was there anything in particular that bothered you today ? I do n't know . It 's just that since I started losing my hair ... it seems like the guys around the loading dock are laughing behind my back . Ah . And besides that , I split this pair of pants today ... bending down to pick up a crate . - Look at that . - Ah , that 's awful . It must be a faulty pair . We should complain to the manufacturer . - You 're darn right . - Is there a label in there ? Well , let 's see . They usually keep one around the , uh ... Ah , what the hell . Another 20 bucks down the hole . - How was your day ? - You know , the oddest thing happened . Remember that time we took the kids on the roller coaster ride ... It sounded like a hillbilly jug band or something . Well , on the way to school today ... Jimmy stuck his head out the window , and I heard it again . Weird . Must be the kids . Must have forgot their keys again . Aw , how 's my little buddies ? Whew . It 's cold out there . Talk about freezing your face off . - Hi , Daddy . - Hi , muffin . - I brought the mail in . - Ah , thank you . How was school today ? It was fine , exceptJimmy got in trouble ' cause he kept giving Miss Jenkins raspberries . - Did not ! - You did too . - Not ! Not ! - You did too ! Stop that . I 'll have none of that in my house . - And you , young man . What 's this on the back of your head ? - What , Dad ? - This . - Aw , they did it again ? " Planet Uranus . Probably just some more of that asinine humor . You 're gon na have to learn just to turn the other cheek . Daddy ? - Yes , pumpkin ? - Daddy , can I get some , um , hair extensions ? Ah , pumpkin , you need that like you need another hole in your head . Daddy , but the boys seem to like ' em . Well , those boys are just packing your head full of nonsense . I 'll get it . - Mrs . Buttman ? - Yes . - Gas man . - We did n't call the gas man . Good God ! It smells like foot and ass in this house . Whoo ! Man ! Uh , there 's been a report of a gas leak in the neighborhood ... and , uh , judging from the smell of things , I think it 's coming from this house . - I do n't smell anything . Do you smell anything ? - No , Ma . Not at all . Buttman . Look here , man , if y'all ai n't gon na light a match ... invest in some incense . Whoo ! - Everybody , come here . You 've got ta see this . - What ? Ah , just come on . You 'll see . - Ooh ! - Uau ! - It 's a full moon . - A full moon .

Do n't go unconscious , please . You 'll be okay . I feel terrible . I feel so sick . Oh , sweetie .

Oh , I remember because it was sweeps and there was , everything was going haywire . Mrs . Chancellor was getting her facelift on national television , but they paid for it ... Ah , sweetheart , sweetheart , I 'm dying . Oh , I 'm going . I 'm going . It 's not so bad . Remember , sweetheart . Do n't swallow . It could kill you . You mean my mother was right ?

Miss Babcock . Is n't it true that you were in love with him yourself and felt that it should have been your wedding ? - No ! - Excuse me , dear . Is n't it true , dear , that you were so bitter , dear , that you wished them both to die a miserable and horrible death ? No ! You can tell the truth , my child , and the truth will set you free and that 's the truth of it . All right , it 's true ! It 's true . I wished it ! I wished them dead ! I 'm sorry .

If the Coast Guard wo n't find them , then I will ! C.C . Babcock does n't give up . I have stuck by Maxwell through 16 girlfriends and two dead wives . One dead wife .

Our grandson has colic , and it 's driving our daughter crazy . We must have talked for almost 20 minutes . Where was Traxler at this time ? In the living room , but when I walked back inside , he was gone . I 'm sorry . I just ... JUDY : Dan 's not the kind of person who just up and leaves , so I called his cell phone .   I do n't know .

I 'll make sure she gets something . Greg , do me a favor . Run this scene for me - - Doc Robbins , coroner - - not Al Robbins , husband . It ... it 's still early . All right . Our victim is a white male , 45 . Name 's Dan Traxler . He was found naked in bed , here , supine . No traumatic injuries . Blood on his teeth , gums . ALS indicates semen . That 's her side of the bed . Ever . Doc , you really got to go . So I 'm , uh , guessing by the increased personnel , Dan did n't die of a heart attack , huh ?  May I see your hands , please ? Hey . Hey . Hey . Good thing about evidence - - it works both ways . It can prove guilt , and it can prove innocence . You know , Jim Brass did n't believe a thing I said . If I was going to have an affair , I would n't be having it in my house , in my bed . You know , every marriage has its problems , but that bed 's sacred . You cross that line , and there 's no going back . Her fingers are green , right ? How did you know that ? You deadhead , do n't you ? That 's what you were doing on the phone with your daughter ? Yes . That 's just sleep deprivation . Strap him into the car . Well , did he nap today ? RUSSELL : Stems were still moist . Just been pruned . There was a pile of brown leaves on the table - - about 20 minutes worth , as a matter of fact . Best way to keep geraniums in bloom . Ah . I knew there was a secret . You know what to do , right ? Test for chlorophyll . BRASS : How are things between you and Judy ? Solid . Did you know the victim , Dan Traxler ? - No . - Your wife knew him . Judy 's friends with a lot of people . We found an ATM receipt last night with a large cash withdrawal . Judy has girls ' night out on Tuesdays . Except , last night , she stayed in . Are you investigating this incident , Jim , or my wife ? Look , Al , you know , you 're not the only guy to get blindsided . My ex-wife screwed around on me for a year . Me . Go figure . Well , consider this . They 're drinking wine . They went from the living room to the bedroom . I do n't believe it was like that . All right , look , this is more information than I 'm prepared to give you anyway , okay , but I see a pattern here . Judy 's night out was Traxler 's night in . Th-There 's got to be more than that . Look , as my friend , I am asking you to broaden the scope of your investigation . You got ta prepare yourself , Al . because this is only gon na get worse . No , you got ta prepare yourself to be wrong . Your past is clouding your judgment , and I expect more than that from you . You okay ? Want to take a minute ? Dr . Sloane ... what do we know ? Daniel Traxler is an otherwise healthy adult male . No traumatic injuries . No lacerations . No broken bones . Heart tissue shows no signs of ischemia or infarction . And the penile swab ? Sent it to DNA . Did anything present ?  Just this . ROBBINS : Frenulum is torn . That explains the blood in his mouth . RUSSELL : He was smothered . I 'm sorry , Al . This looks like a homicide . Smothering is passive . It 's got female written all over it . Can you just process the bathroom ?  You know , if it was anybody else , I 'd buy the whole cheating wife thing , but ... it 's Doc . He 's amazing . Nothing ever slows him down . He 's got this great outlook on life . And every day he comes home and takes off his legs . HODGES : Sildenafil . Wow . At least he 's keeping up his end of the bargain . Why would Judy do this to him ? SANDERS : Do n't the Robbins have a cat - - a gray tabby ?  Yeah . Her name 's Cinder . My stepfather was allergic to cats . I found a box of condoms under the sink where Doc could n't see them . At least Judy cared enough about him not to give him a disease while she was screwing around . - Hodges , you need to shift it into neutral . I 'm gon na go look for that litter box .  Cinder ? Hey , have you seen that cat ? I think I spooked it . Yeah . He , uh , ran in that room . What have you got ? Carpet impressions , but ... they 're not the same shape or size as anything else in the room . Maybe it 's a table or a lamp . Then it would 've blocked the pathway to the sofa . SANDERS : Well , whatever it was , it 's not here now . BRASS : So , Judy ... Tell me more about Dan Traxler . Uh , he was a-a genealogist . And when did the affair start ? - There was no affair . - Come on . The lingerie , candles , romantic music ... Al and I like to keep things interesting . Judy , you 're not here because , you know , you 're having an affair . I really do n't care . You 're here because it 's a homicide . I did not cheat on my husband , and I did not kill Dan . Am I free to go ? Nope . These marks were left on your living room rug . Do you know what made them ? No . BRASS : Judy , whoever you 're protecting , it 's not gon na matter in the end . Albert , I ca n't let you see her until I 've confirmed your alibi . Captain , I-I 'd like to ask Mrs . Robbins a question , if that 's cool with you . As long as you do n't pass notes from your new best friend . BRODY : Did Mr . He , uh ... brought a briefcase . We did n't find a briefcase . He definitely brought it into the house . Was there anyone else in the house besides you and Mr . Traxler ? Yes . Whoever killed him . Hey . You were married . Do you think it 's odd that our dead genealogist was on Judy 's side of the bed ? Well ... you choose a side early on in a relationship , and you pretty much stay there , unless you 're ... mixing it up with some extracurricular . Did you find semen ? Yeah . Henry 's testing it now . We think that Traxler might have had a briefcase . Only , Morgan and I were n't able to find one at the scene . Judy have time to ditch it ? I do n't see how she could . She was on the phone for 20 minutes with her daughter . Two minutes later , she called Traxler 's cell , and a minute after that , 911 . Marvin Gaye ? " Sexual Healing " ? Why else would you play Marvin Gaye ? Well , if that briefcase is missing , it had to be important to someone . You need to find out more about your dead genealogist . And always get permission from the church or the cemetery administrator before you start any grave rubbing . WOMAN : Does n't friction damage the stone ? Yes , it can . That 's why I use synthetic rice paper and light , even strokes . There , okay ? All right , you guys go out and do it . - Have fun . - Okay , thank you . You bet . Donna Hoppe ? Yeah ? Your secretary told me you would be here . My name is Greg Sanders ; I 'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab . Sanders ? that 's Americanized , right ? Yeah . Shortened from Sanderson . From Oslo . How many were named Olaf ? My grandfather was Olaf Hojem the eighth .  You should hyphenate . Hojem is an infinitely more interesting name than Sanders . But if you wanted a genealogy lesson , you should have shown up earlier , for my seminar . Actually , I 'm here on other business . Mrs . Hoppe , I 'm very sorry to tell you this , but your business partner , Dan Traxler , was killed last night . Oh , my God . How ? What happened ? Well , we 're investigating it as a homicide .  Oh , my ... Do you know if he had any enemies ? Anyone threaten him or your business ? No . Dan was a prince . Everybody loved him . Genealogy was his life . If he had any faults , it was that he got too close to his clients . What about his personal life ? No , he was n't seeing anyone . Did he have a client list ? Um ... Client names , phone numbers . Oh , great , thanks . SANDERS : Mrs . Hoppe , was it normal for your partner to meet with his clients at night ? Yes , we try to accommodate their schedules . If they 're working , then we visit them after work . SANDERS : There 's a Judy Robbins on this list . Do you know her ? No , I think he finished that project . I 'm sorry . Will you excuse me , please ? Thank you for not asking how I 'm doing . David 's been asking me every five minutes . Well , he 's concerned . As we all are . I know what you 're thinking . Well , uh ... it 's just hard enough when someone you love 's in trouble . It 's harder still when you 're dealing with betrayal . You do n't think about that when you have an affair ... a-and I wanted to see if I could . Almost destroyed Judy and our marriage . When I was married to Eddie , he would hurt me , and then ... I would hurt him back , and it was just ... years of back and forth . That what you think happened here ?  Cath , I have to take this , I 'm sorry . Yeah.Oh , of course . Yeah , thanks for getting back to me so quickly . I got your name from a colleague . My wife needs a criminal defense attorney . It 's a murder . Hey , Russell wants an update . You know , for a guy who seems so laid back , Russell can be terrifying . Terrifying ? No . I mean , maybe a bit odd or demanding . But , hey , as long as you get the job done as fast as humanly possible ... Does he ever yell out your name ? I like to think of it as a respectful shout . - Hm . I did n't find semen from Traxler anywhere , but I found his saliva . - On a pillow ? - Likely the murder weapon . Found touch DNA , too . SANDERS : So the killer did n't wear gloves . And the DNA 's male , and ... not Doc Robbins ' . I 'm running it through CODIS right now . And our guy 's not in CODIS . I 'll give you anything if you tell Russell . So , the DNA 's a dead end ? Um ... well , not necessarily . We could expand our search from an individual to a family . If it gets a hit in CODIS , that family could lead us to the killer , like a DNA family tree . If the killer has family in CODIS , we 'll get a partial match . Just ... just one problem . Uh , ca n't exactly push a button to do this search . Was there something else ? No . Okay . I ca n't believe somebody hurt that nice man . Ms . Smith , you were on Dan Traxler 's client list . - You hired him ? - Yes . See , I 'm getting married . And my dad 's dead ; his folks , too . My mom 's not close to our family , but I thought if I found her father - - my grandfather - - maybe he could walk me down the aisle . So you wanted Mr . Traxler to find him ? Yeah . He said if my grandfather was alive , he could track him down . - Did he ? - I do n't know . We were supposed to meet again today . He was excited to show me new documents and records he found . He was like a paper detective . Mr . Traxler ever ... behave inappropriately towards you ?  : God , no . The guy was a monk . He lived in the past . I spoke with a couple of them before I hired him . Oh , did you speak to Judy Robbins ? Yeah . She could n't say enough nice things about him . I was really counting on having my grandfather at my wedding . What is your grandfather 's name ? Samuel Francis Duggan . Is n't that a nice name . And here 's to you , Mrs . Ro-hah-bins ... ? That 's not funny , and I 'm busy . So if you have any results for me , cough ' em up .  Lipstick on the victim 's face was a match to Judy 's brand . Well , she said she gave him CPR . I 'll bet that 's not all she gave him . I 'm just saying that when I play " Sexual Healing , " it 's foreplay . Yeah , well , playing it for yourself does n't count . Why would a cat need antidepressants ? Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for felines undergoing prolonged medical treatment . And ... check this out . One sweep of my radiation isotope identifier ...  ... rings like a Super Jackpot . SANDERS : So the cat urine is radioactive ? Iodine 131 . It 's used to treat thyroid cancer , and it has a half-life of eight days . Now , I 'm thinking that the sick cat belonged to the illicit lover . No . No way . I checked Traxler 's shoes , office , house - - no kitty litter and no kitty . There 's always the " unknown accomplice " theory . Or ... Judy 's telling the truth and someone else was in that house . Either way , you 're looking for a sick cat . Chemotherapy 's expensive , done only by veterinary specialists . Okay , so then get me a list of those specialists and every cat they 've treated in the last eight days . Get me a warrant .  RUSSELL : Henry , what do you got ? - Ah , the CODIS familial search found our killer 's first order relative . - A Jimmy Duggan . - " First order " meaning father , brother , son of our killer , right ? Here 's what I 've got . Traxler 's client , Carla Duggan Smith , was looking for her grandfather -- Samuel Francis Duggan . Maybe Traxler found Sam , and then Sam found Traxler ? So now we need to find Sam . Hey , maybe Jimmy knows where he is . I actually did some extra credit . I could tell you where Jimmy is . Same place he 's been the last 13 years . That 's almost too easy . Whatever you want , I did n't do it .  It says here that you 're serving a life sentence for armed robbery That third strike , that-that 's a bitch . I 'll bet . He divorced my crazy bitch of a mother . I mean , she was always high on something . Used to beat the crap out of me . - That must 've been rough . - Yeah , well , you wo n't see me crying . When the old man left , I did , too , you know ? On my own at 13 . No wonder I ended up in the big house , right ? Do you have any brothers , Jimmy ? No . I got one sister-- Jasmine . She likes to pretend I 'm dead . And , of course , the old man , he could have more , I do n't know . No , I 'm looking for full male relatives , no steps . - You have any sons ? - Nope . What did that bastard do ? Maybe nothing , maybe murder . Well , hot damn ! We 'd be cell mates . She lives in Primm . I searched all our databases - - all I got was Samuel Duggan 's date of birth . Oh , archival databases are notoriously incomplete . He could live in another state ; he could be dead . But Dan would have discovered that weeks ago and informed his client . So ... let 's find Jimmy 's father Sam by doing the Smith-Duggan family tree . Okay , tell me what you know . All right , uh , my boss talked with Jimmy Duggan . His dad , Sam , married Eunice Carter in 1956 or ' 57 , right out of high school . - Mm-hmm . They had Jimmy in 1958 and his sister Jasmine in ' 67 . Now , Jasmine Duggan married Gary Smith in ' 88 , and they had Carla in 1990 . Oh , she 's the client who wanted to be walked down the aisle by a male relative , right ? Right . According to Jimmy , there are no other male relatives .  : Okay , Hojem-Sanders ... All we have to do is find it .  BRAD LEWIS : She 's done answering questions . Judy , let 's go .  Oh ... Al ...  I just want to go home . Listen , Mr . Lewis will drive you home . Al ... we need to talk . I want to explain everything . It 's just ... Judy , Judy ... I need to believe in you - - in us - - and if we talk and I 'm not convinced ... it 'll all be gone , and I 'm not prepared for that .  : Okay . Well , when you 're ready to talk ... I 'll be at home . Sit down , Hojem-Sanders . Have I got a story for you . Sam and Eunice 's divorce decree . And here 's the interesting part . Why is that ? Eunice was pregnant . Judges wo n't grant a divorce if the woman is with child . They want to wait till after the birth to resolve any custody issues . So Jimmy Duggan could have a sibling that he does n't even know about . Oh , it gets better - - there is no mention of a baby in this decree . And there 's no record of a birth certificate in 1971 for a Duggan . And I even checked under Eunice 's maiden name Carter . Nothing . So where does that leave us ? " A baby was left on the steps of Desert Palm Hospital yesterday . " In honor of St . Patrick 's Day , " the nurses named him Baby Patrick . " He will be sent to St . Martine 's Orphanage later this week . " March 17 , 1971 . Date fits . It 's not very scientific . Well , this is n't science , this is genealogy . Trust your gut . Have faith . SANDERS : I 'm really digging . this genealogy stuff . When Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden , back in 1814 , with the Treaty of Kiel , my great-great grandfather , Olaf Hojem , was one of the leaders of the uprising against Swedish rule . He helped convene the first Norwegian assembly and write the national constitution . That sounds great , but tell me about Baby Patrick . Well , St . Martine 's Orphanage is long-gone , but Donna was able to track down one of the nuns . According to Sister Mary Agnes , Patrick 's legal name is Patrick O'Toole , which was the nun 's family name . Apparently , there 's a lot of O'Tooles running around Vegas . What do we know about Patrick O'Toole ? Uh , he 's still local . I checked out his work - - Hodges is at his apartment now . Hey . Wait until I tell you about Eunice Duggan . So Eunice was ex-wife of Samuel and mother of Jimmy . SANDERS : And possibly the birth mother of Patrick O'Toole , who dumped him at Desert Palm Hospital . Eunice gave up DNA , but denies having a kid in 1971 . Anyway , Henry 's running her swab against the other samples . HODGES : Okay , so , uh , the landlord would not let me into Patrick O'Toole 's apartment , but he did give me one very interesting piece of information . O'Toole has a cat . A sick cat . And there 's only one vet in Vegas that does cat thyroid chemo .  What-What about my cat ? You pretended to be my vet , you told me Barclay needs emergency surgery ? That 's entrapment or something . BRASS : If I were you , I 'd be more worried about the DNA sample we just sent to the lab . - Barclay needs his meds . All right ? Now that we got the cat out of the way , let 's talk about murder . You ever hear of Dan Traxler ? Nope . Let me see the bottom of your ) Radioactive cat litter . BRASS : So , you were in Judy Robbins 's house . Who the hell 's she ? Dan Traxler was visiting her when you killed him . Look , the evidence is going to tell us . I just want to hear it from you . What the hell 's wrong with you ? I think I screwed up the DNA . Well , if you screw up the DNA , you can kiss your career good-bye . I know ! Just ... look . Well , the sample runs look fine . Look at the references . Oh .  I 'm not so sure you did anything wrong , but somebody might 've . Well , I 'm not gon na do this by myself . Get the reagent . Not a lot of diversity , so , Eunice , Jimmy and Patrick are related . Just not how we thought they were . We need to confirm this with Y-STR . Y-chromosome-linked DNA . That 's the only way to be certain . - Missing briefcase ? - Yup . Recovered it from Patrick 's car . All right , great . So that proves that he was in Doc 's house . What was in it ? Documents from a bunch of clients , including Carla Duggan Smith . Traxler kept very detailed records of everything - - every meeting , every phone call . And according to his log , he did meet with Patrick several times , including the day he was murdered . Maybe Traxler stumbled across Patrick when he was looking for Carla 's grandfather . You know , maybe he thought he 'd found another relative for Carla to invite to her wedding . Oh , good . Greg ! Good job . You know we have an intercom system . I got our motive . I know why Patrick killed Traxler . And it 's twisted . Cue the banjo music . This report says that your DNA was found on the pillow used to smother Dan Traxler . Without saying one word , that 's 25 to life . It also says that the Duggans have one hell of a family secret . Screw you . You were orphaned , abandoned , on your own since you were born . Must have developed a thick skin . Probably tried to forget you even had a family . Hard to miss what you 've never had . Until that genealogist showed up ... asking questions about your family , especially your father . And your curiosity got the best of you . BRASS : So you followed him , and I 'm betting that the old lady , Mama Eunice , was n't too happy to see you . And she told you who your father was . My mother had sex with her own son . BRASS : When Jimmy was 13 . Now , that 's rape in 50 states , without a statute of limitations . She 's going down , and you 're the walking , talking proof of her crime . Why take your anger out on Traxler ? This guy shows up all excited , talking about family reunions and happy endings . SANDERS : And for the first time in your life , you thought , you 're not alone . - Yeah . And thanks to him , I know just how screwed up my family is . What were you doing at Judy Robbins 's house ? After I left that crazy bitch , I went to Traxler 's office to get in his face . Saw him leave , so I followed him . - Patrick . - Get up . Now ! Come with me . And the briefcase . You banging this broad ? Absolutely not . She 's just a client . Now get in the bed . Okay , okay ...  PATRICK : Everybody screws everybody in this world . I knew you cops would think it was a sex thing . My mother 's a drunken whore , and my brother 's my father . I did n't need to know that . He ruined my life . SANDERS : Well , for what it 's worth , I do n't think Traxler knew about the incest . - I do n't care ! - Rodriguez , wrap him up . That 's it ? He should 've just left it alone . SANDERS : Donna . What brings you here ? I found Grandpa Sam in Provo . He goes by Grafs now . And he 's agreed to meet Carla . Oh . Well , after all that , I hope he walks her down the aisle . Hojem-Sanders , you are a true romantic . It 's very appealing . We arrested the man who killed Dan . I heard . Thank you for that .  In the 1900s , Alrik Magnar Hojem was one of the richest men in Edina , Minnesota . And legend has it , that because of his vast wealth and enormous ego , he earned the nickname " cake-eaters , " a derogatory term used to describe all Edina residents by their less affluent neighbors . Alrik was my great uncle . His ego was legendary . In fact , that 's how my family ended up in California . Ah . If I wanted to learn more about my family history , is it okay to call you ? Of course . But let 's concentrate on the Hojems . And remember , hyphenate . Hey . I 'm glad I caught you . Al , everything Judy said checked out . I just could n't get past that first impression . Hard for me to get past it , too . Yeah , I guess I was punishing her for what my ex-wife did to me , but that was my marriage , not yours . I appreciate that , Jim . Yeah ... Oh , uh ... oh , this is ...  This was in Traxler 's briefcase . It has your name on it . I 'll let Judy tell you what 's inside . Go home to your wife , buddy . Hi . Hi .  I was beginning to think you were going to sleep at the office . I 'm sorry for doubting you . And ... I 'm sorry for ... for keeping secrets . I ... I wanted it to be a surprise . You did that . Al , I love you . Do n't ever doubt that . I won't .   Mm ! All right , go ahead , open it . Whoa ! Yeah . And look at this . Look . I 'm related to Buffalo Bill Cody . That is so cool . == sync , corrected by elderman ==

No , it 's not . But without you , Peter Fleming will win control of the prisons , and that ca n't happen . Listen , just listen to me , Portman . I know what you 're going through . Palm City , it 's like Peter Fleming 's laboratory . But if he succeeds here , it 'll just spread unless people start standing up . I ca n't show my face , Portman , but I can and I will watch your back . But you have to do this . Palm City needs you . What are you , some - - some do-good vigilante ? Some superhero ?

I am here to provide the justice to others that my husband was denied , and if you have a vertebra in your spine , you 'll give me the chance . This interview is over . And as for the vertebra in my spine , it works both ways , because now I 'm afraid to send you home . You defend your clients with this much energy ? Yeah , I do . Faradays are fighters . Find a desk . I murdered my brother , and my mother , and my two sisters . Cain is the father of all murderers . Cain 's real name is Raimonde LeFleur . Raimonde LeFleur ? Yes . Raimonde LeFleur . Man , this guy 's super French . What are you doing ? I am inside the Ark police search engine . Would n't bet your password 's still good , Vince . Yeah , maybe not mine , but Marty 's on the other hand - - what the hell was it ? He never changed it . It 's , uh , his mom 's cat that he hated . Flowers , Flowers . I 'm in . Nice one . Cain 's got about 50 aliases here and an address 2 years old . It 's worth a shot . Okay , you stay on Portman . And if Cain gets to Portman before I get to Cain , you call me . Play safe . Love what you 've done with the place . What the hell do you want ? Rollo made a cauliflower soup . The smell alone drove me away . He has a profound lack of talent in the kitchen . Are n't you forgetting something ? Most men would have walked away . Not you . My family 's not my weakness , Max . It 's my strength . But if choose to stay and fight , they will be in danger . Not as long as Vince Faraday 's dead . Is that a secret you 're willing to keep ? This is a war . I was a cop , I was a soldier . I 'll do what I have to to keep my family safe . The Cape is just a tool . It alone wo n't get you home . Only Vince Faraday can do that . Do n't ever forget who it is that 's wearing The Cape . I wo n't , Max . Thank you . Mr . Portman , thank you for agreeing to meet with me . Mr . Fleming , understand that nothing can convince me ... Oh , my God . We are fully booked , I 'm afraid . Anna Orlando .

The Hollow has to be killed . And if she dies , then I die . And what 's the alternative , you help her ? You ca n't betray your family . That 's kind of my specialty . You have been dead 1,500 years , surely you can spare an hour . Every second counts if you want Davina to continue breathing . What is it that you need , then ? Am I to handle your errands ? Or your laundry ? It 's actually quite simple . I have long wanted to be mortal , but now that I am alive , I can die . In fact , your own family is relentless in their quest to kill me . Look , if you want me to put in a good word , that ship has sailed , darling . I have my own protection spell , cast in the form of a totem . You will safeguard my totem , until I 'm done with your family . If you falter , if any harm comes my way , Davina will suffer with me . The Hollow , she 's getting stronger . Like she 's draining everything out of the city . She already took Uncle Elijah . And soon she will come for the rest of us . Listen , Hope , I know you 're scared . But over the years , a lot of bad people have stood against our family , and all of them have fallen . The Hollow is no different . No , she is different .    FREYA : Despite the spell I cast , the very integrity of the pendant is growing unstable . It wo n't be able to hold Elijah 's soul much longer . We need to find a way to resurrect him tonight , or we could lose him forever . To do that , we 'll need more power . Let me guess , a grand sacrifice . I say we kill our enemy and sacrifice her , then I can channel the power from the Hollow 's death , raise Elijah 's body , and place him back where he belongs . Labonair blood is her Achilles ' heel . Hayley , your blood weakened her , but you 've technically been dead for years . So it wo n't be strong enough to kill her . If we forge a blade using the blood of the last living Labonair ... We do n't want Hope involved . FREYA : She 's already involved . Hope has been obsessed with the symbol that follows the Hollow : the serpent consuming itself . Now , I believe this is showing us the key , the only means to which she can be destroyed , her own blood . The Hollow 's one end of the Labonair bloodline . Hope is the other . And we need to close that loop . The best way to do that is for Hayley to wield a weapon forged with Hope 's blood . When she stabs her , it 's only then the Hollow can be obliterated completely . Then we make it work . I 'll talk to Hope . Well , hey there . Uh , it 's me again ... hundred things . Like how Eddie uses this weird baby voice anytime he says " hi " to a random dog . I do n't know , might be a deal breaker .  Or how I finally watched Practical Magic . And you were right . Perfect movie . Or , you know ... how freakin ' much I still miss you . I miss her , too . Hey . Next time , we should carpool . Actually , I 'm looking for Vincent . He said he 'd find a cure for Sofya , but he 's been M.I.A . Have you seen him ? No . What , you want some help finding him ? No . No , but if you see him , why do n't you call me . FREYA : Dauha naer do smrti . Dauha naer do smrti . Dauha naer do smrti . That 's a rather odd locator spell . I 'm trying to trace the Hollow 's magic . Almost have it . At one time , it was the center of high society , but that all changed when Dr . LaForge tortured and killed his friends and family . Claimed until his dying day that an evil spirit made him do it . That house has been derelict since . The perfect lair for someone who relishes tragedy .  REBEKAH : What 's that ? If the serpent at the LaForge House represents the Hollow herself , then this must be some sort of totem she 's using to magnify her power and protect herself . Dahlia used to use these when she was up to something particularly awful . It will render the Hollow unkillable . We will have to destroy it before we can face her . Lovely . I could do with some fresh air . And some fresh blood . Take the map . It 's been spelled to track the totem . Do n't go alone . One step ahead of you , sis . KOL : Hey , Bex . Perfect .  . You 're not seriously going in there alone , are you ? Why not ? As far as threats go , the only person with the means to kill me is lurking right out here . I 'm not a threat to you , the Hollow , on the other hand , is . The Hollow 's got some acolyte protecting a totem that magnifies her power , making her unkillable . Trouble is , we have to end this tonight . Hayley 's got the means . I just need to make sure she 's vulnerable . Kol 's coming to watch my back , so you can just scamper off . What kind of gentlemen would I be if I did n't offer to escort you ? You 're the king of this city . Ca n't you condemn this dump ? How about we skip the criticism and just focus on what we 're looking for ? KOL : Totem 's not here . You were supposed to wait for me . Well , I got bored . And it looks like you got accosted by the local riffraff . Oh , you got a problem ? Get over yourselves . All right ? The map says that the totem is still here , so it must be hidden somewhere in this hovel . Look , if you do n't trust me , help yourself . Come on in .  What ... What the hell , Kol ? A dark object ? Really ? Kol , you better undo this right now . I 'm sorry , Rebekah . I truly am . Why are you helping her ? What has she done to you ? I do n't want to . Are you scared it 's gon na hurt ? I 'm scared if I do this , you 're gon na pick a fight . And the Hollow , she can hurt you . I know you 're scared . I wish we did n't have to have this conversation . I did n't want that for you , but here we are . The thing is , sometimes you have to do things that you do n't want to do because you 're the only one that can do them . Like you . Like me . Okay .  Rebekah 's not answering . Neither is Kol . The sooner we end this the better . No . We have to assume that Inadu 's totem is still intact . We can not attack her until we destroy it . Go after Rebekah , find the totem . I 'm not leaving Hayley alone . We 're out of time . The cracks are getting worse . I need you to destroy the totem . I 'll go with Hayley . And what about Hope ? Compel her a nanny . We do n't have another choice . You 're the best advantage we got . Be fast , be brutal , destroy the totem , or we 're dead . Here . For you and Hayley tonight . You should destroy this . Hayley could die . And why is her life more important than yours ? I ca n't take a little girl 's mother away from her , Kol . All right , then we just have to find another way to get you out of this . Because there is no way I 'm letting you go . I 've been thinking , Elijah once gave me one of your mother 's spells . It used to break a magical link . I 'm too weak right now , but if we could find a coven to counter Inadu 's spell , then ... No , I know the spell . And we do n't need a coven , we just need one powerful little witch .  I have a car in the lot out back . If I 'm not back by midnight , you take it and you go . Wait , without you ? What ... Are you kidding ? What are you doing ? Davina , I 'm not asking . I need you to do this . One for each of us . Once the totem is destroyed , we can sacrifice the Hollow . Are you okay ? Yeah .  I never thought twice about fighting or dying for family before . But now , with Keelin ... Now you have someone you 're afraid you 're not gon na make it home to . You will make it home , Freya . I got your back . Hayley . I know we have n't always seen eye-to-eye , but ... well , I suppose family rarely does .   I guess she knows we 're here .     There you are . Jackson ? Been waiting for you . How am I here ? How are you here ? I 'm no expert , but I 'm guessing you 're going through some kind of psychological break right now . You 've been through hell . So your mind took you somewhere peaceful , Honestly , I 'm flattered you thought of me . Figured your happy place would be somewhere with Elijah . I know . I know . I 'm on your side . We 'll get you back in the fight , before the Hollow finishes whatever she started . Hey , buddy . Are my mom and dad back ? Not quite . Hey , you know what I used to do , when I was bored at your age ? Magic . I 'm not supposed to do magic with strangers . What ? I-I 'm family . So why did you go away ? I went away because I was sad . And I thought I 'd never be happy again . And I did n't want to make everybody that I loved around me sad , too .  Hayley ? FREYA : Hayley ? Hayley ? No . More wolfsbane . I want her alive , but barely . She still has a part to play . No . No , no , no . You were supposed to be ... This is n't real . No , you ca n't be dead . You are n't dead . Not yet . Sofya . Apologies . I ca n't be expected to remember the names of wanton trollops . Listen , I 'm gon na ask you nicely to shut the hell up about her . You know what ? Why do n't we just burn the house down ? Oh , do n't be so dramatic . Dramatic ? I 'm not running late for a manicure , Marcel . Time is running out to resurrect Elijah , Hayley 's on a suicide mission , and I ca n't lose anyone else I love . I have reached my quota of heartbreak for the year . Rebekah ... How ironic . Two of the world 's most powerful beings trapped in a magical butterfly net . Tell me you were n't overwhelmed by some brain-dead witch . No , our biggest mistake was trusting Kol - for one second of his life . - What ? Kol is protecting the totem for the Hollow . Who knows why , or what she offered him . I do n't care what she offered him . If I do n't , we could lose Elijah forever . Is he good to you ? Hey , talk to me . It ai n't gon na kill me . He has been good to me . But when I fell for him , I was scared of Klaus , of ... being a mom , and he made me feel safe . But now , I ... Well , if you wanted safety , you would 've loved me . I chose you . I married you . But you were in love with him .  I mean , it 's an old , sad story . The monsters treated you like crap , turned you into a girl who loves monsters . You 're not helping me . You 're stalling me .   No .  Oh , you 're not you . You 're the Hollow .     You 're wasting your energy . You 're a vision . You ca n't hurt me .   , gasps Suppose your girlfriend wo n't be happy that you spent the entire day with me . Sofya has n't woken since the Hollow invaded her mind . You could at least feign sympathy . Why ? She shot me . Multiple times . Is that really the reason why you hate her so much ?  Okay .  What the hell are you doing ? The main gas line 's got to be down here . At least it 'll help torch the place faster , unless you prefer a slow burn . Thought you wanted to wait it out .  Do you ? If I untie this knot ... your girlfriend will be free from the Hollow ? I hope so . And you really love her ? Yes . Kind of like your mom loves , uh ... Uncle Elijah . You are miraculously well-adjusted .   Why are you doing this ?  All I ever wanted was to protect you !  : And now you 're gon na die here . - No ... You 're not here .  I 'm always here . This is the vision of me that keeps you up at night , the fear of what you know to be inevitable .  All right . Focus on the knot , luv . It 's very important , and I 'll be right back . I imagine right now you 're rather cross with me . You should know I have my reasons . Rebekah suggested I hear them . I 'd rather rip out your vocal chords .  . Hey , sorry , we 're closed . Well , maybe you can make an exception . Davina ? I do n't know how long I have , but I had to see you to thank you . Wh-What do you mean ? Thank me ? For what ? For visiting me . And for talking to me . You heard it ? Y-You were there . Josh , I was always there .  Now stop and listen . I did what I did for Davina .  Lovesick imbecile . The Hollow preys upon your weakness . She raised Davina to get you to betray your family , and you , pathetic as you are , leapt at the chance . Our family owes Davina that much . I owe nothing to her . Nor to you . JACKSON : You saw it : the violence , the rage .  That 's what he is . You fell for the suit , Hayley . You were blinded by his charade . You 're not Jackson , and you do n't deserve to wear his face .  -  -  You 're right . Jackson was good .  , wheezes And me ...   well , I was never good .  No , Nik , please . Hayley . Hey . Are you all right ? Did Klaus break the totem ? I hope so . But we ca n't wait . You need to stab the Hollow . You think you 'll be strong enough ? Let 's do this . Please , grant me this small mercy . Mercy is a privilege reserved for family . Your status has been revoked . Brother , no ! Please ! For a thousand years , I 've never experienced love or peace . Davina changed me .  What if it was Camille ? What if it could bring her back ? ! Would you not do as I did ? !  INADU : Cencahua ezhuia . Cencahua ezhuia . Cencahua ezhuia . Cencahua ezhuia . Cuauhtzicoa calpanpilli . Cuauhtzicoa calpanpilli .   First , - I will break your body . -  Then I will break your spirit . Your spirit is nearly broken already , is n't it ?  Hey , what 's wrong ?  Do it . No . No !  That 's enough ! That 's enough ! She 's gone . She 's gone .  . @siren_wailing , emergencyhornhonking Are you all right ? You know how I love to blow things up . Good night . All right , what the hell happened ? I woke up from a dagger nap to find you trying to kill everyone that I love . Your brother ripped my heart out and then tossed my body off a bridge . And I did n't even see you crying . I mourned the man I thought I knew . Well , I 'm sorry , I must have missed that while you were trying to curse me . I asked you to leave with me ! Seven years ago , I asked you . But you did n't love me as much as you love New Orleans . All right , I do love New Orleans , all right , I do . And I watched it burn to the ground for you once before , Rebekah . And then I waited a century ... and you did n't even come back for me . So you just forgot about me ? You know , it 's probably best if you just do that again . Yeah .  : Damn it . ? You 're a bow and arrow . A broken guitar . While the rainwater washes away who you are . We go over the mountains ... ? If Klaus got to him ... Then you have to leave anyway . ? Over the mountains ... ? Davina , you almost died back there . ? You 're a bow and arrow ... ? Look , you remember the first day we met ? You told me you wanted to be normal . You said " normal 's relative . " Yeah , well , you 're a twice-resurrected Harvest Girl with an Original vampire boyfriend . Normal 's always gon na be relative . But with or without him , you have to take this chance . You deserve it . I ca n't just leave him . KOL : Well , that sounds like a broken promise . ? And I want you to close my eyes ... ? I thought that you were daggered , or worse . Are you ready to go ? Anywhere . Anywhere ? Everywhere . ? I want you to hold my hands ... ? Thank you . ? Over my heart ... ? I love you . ? I want you to close my eyes ... ? I love you , too . ? When it grows dark ... ? Now get out of here . Go . ? A broken guitar . While the rainwater washes away who you are . We go over the mountains . And under the stars . We go over the mountains . And under the stars . ? Hayley asked me to give you the knife . She 's not going to be here for when Elijah wakes ? She said there was something she had to do . Oh , well , you know as well as anyone how the Hollow meddles in your mind , clawing at your oldest wounds , making them new again . Well , at least you have someone to comfort you now . Freya , are you all right ? Yeah . I just need to focus . The Hollow killed our brother for her own ends . It 's only fitting that we use hers to bring him home . Give me your hands .   Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . ? Lover , hunter , friend and enemy . You will always be every one of these . Lover , hunter , friend and enemy . You will always be every one of these . Nothing 's fair in love and war . In life ... ? Jack ... I did n't get to say this before , so I need to say it now . You are who I should have wanted . You were right . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . HAYLEY : But I could never manage to give up Elijah . I could n't walk away . I know that 's messed up . I guess I never really ... saw what love was supposed to look like . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . Verha hel igjen . ? You will always be every one of these ... ? But I do n't want that for Hope . I wish she knew you . I wish a lot of things . As for Elijah , I know what he is . I guess I always knew . But I loved him despite it , or maybe because of it . FREYA : Verha hel igjen . ? Nothing 's fair in love and war ... ? Truth is , I 'm a monster , too . We 've all done terrible things , Jack . Except for Hope . She 's innocent , pure . And I want to make sure she stays that way . ? In love and war . ? I know what I have to do . Your mother told me she tucked you in . I do n't like to sleep when things are happening . You woke Elijah . Yes . And he 's very excited to see you . In the morning , hmm ? There 's nothing to worry about anymore , okay ? You did n't punish Kol . Well ... he 's family . And we protect family . Like you and mom are my protectors , right ? Always and forever . Tomorrow , I 'm going to show you everything I love about New Orleans . The music , the dancing , the art . After all , every princess ought to know her kingdom . Good night , sweetheart . Good night .  
@@5246441 Previously on " The Mist " ... This way . Are you real ? Put down the gun . No ! Team want to celebrate tonight . Do you want to come ? Alex is not old enough for a party . I 'm gon na get you guys a drink . Okay . Adrian saw what happened . He says it was Jay . We need to get inside . We got to go ! Adrian . Wait in the car . What are you gon na do ? Find my wife and daughter . We 're safe . It 's coming ! It 's coming ! What do you see ? Ca n't see anything . I tried warning them there was something out there . They would n't listen . What was it ? My dog ran to the mist , and , something killed it . You think it could be some kind of animal ? Does n't explain this guy . Connor 's gone . MMaybe it 's , chemical warfare , like aan acid cloud ? Well , you 're the soldier . Look , there 'll be food there , supplies . I thought you said you wanted to help . Yeah , but what about the whole cockroach outofmouth incident . I 'm not trying to force anyone to do anything . I 'm coming . Me , too . Well , I 'm not staying here alone , so ... There 's a police car out front . Let 's find the keys and get the hell out of here . Where 's Connor ? He 's gone . That asshole left us here . Mrs . Raven . whose blood is this ? - Yes ? - Father , Police Chief Heisel is here . He looks ... Is he here because of my husband ? What do you mean ? There was a man in the mist . He came out of nowhere . He shot Benedict , and then he shot himself . You ca n't see a thing outside , man . Right up against the front door . When is the police coming ? They will . There 's a lady right here that knows . Thank you . Mrs . Copeland ? I 'm Gus Bradley , the mall manager . Kyle said you saw what happened ? Mrs . Carmody went outside . We heard her scream . She came running back to the window . Her jaw was missing , and then something ... something dragged her back . What was it ? I do n't know . What about her son ? He 's still out there . Come with me . Is it weird I kind of wish that I had seen it ? Not weird , disturbing , profoundly . Should we go out and look for her son ? No one 's going anywhere , Raj , not until we know it 's safe . Could it have been a bear ? I saw her . It was no bear . What are we gon na do if it gets inside ? We make sure it does n't . Okay , everybody , listen up ! I 'm gon na need some help . Let 's hurry . I 've got two keys here . We 'll take the lower level . Okay . - I can help . - Yeah . Let 's go with her . Alex . I just ca n't be here right now . Okay . Mrs . Raven 's in back . She said someone shot her husband and then killed himself . Just now ? Jesus . Should n't you go out there ? She said he killed himself ? All right . Then we sit tight until we know what 's going on . I hoped you knew what it was out there . No idea , but in case it 's toxic smoke or something like that , we stay . It 's better to be safe . Nat , I 'm so sorry . It 's okay . All right . Hey , follow me . Follow me . Look , sit down . Sit down . The man found a set . I 'm scared , okay , like everybody else . I thought ... these might help take the edge off . Please do n't tell him . He 's gon na leave me here . I 'm always the one being left behind . You an addict ? Who got us out of that cell ? You think a junkie could pull that off ? I want the truth . The truth is that ... I want to feel better than I do , and you can go ... yourself if you do n't understand . If this is gon na be a problem out there ... It wo n't be . It wo n't be if you help me . I need you to help me . He does n't have to know . But the pills stay . You think it 's safe to get close to the doors ? It 'll be fine . It 's fine . We 're fine . Thank you for coming with me . - I 'm Kimmi . - Eve . Jesus . What the hell is going on ? Where was it ? Which hallway ? This one . That 's the administration wing . Do we just sit and wait ? Should n't the police be here already ? There might be another option . After 911 , Homeland Security issued radios to all major public outlets . We got one of those . It 's in the security office . What 's wrong ? The security office is in the admin wing , right where you found that body . Jesus . It 's Theo . From accounting . What the hell is going on ? Some kind of terrorism ? Man , what are you looking at me for ? I own a shoe store . Yeah , well you never know . Hey ! Maybe it 's poisonous . Or some type of toxic gas or something . Poison would n't rip his arm off . And Alex and I ran through it . Someone want to make a run for it ? Whatever killed him could still be in there ? The electronics store has a drone with a camera . Dad and I looked at it last time we were there . It 's probably fine , but let 's hurry , just in case . Okay ? Start the engine ! Hurry it 's getting thicker . What the hell ? You ready ? Yeah . Let 's hope it works , it was the only one in the store . Watch it . It 's all right , I know how to fly these things . Do you see anything ? Shh ! It 's closed . We 're safe . One of the other doors was opened . Let 's have a look . Looks empty . But we found the leak . Look outside . Wait . What the ... Who wrote ? What is it ? What do you see ? It 's another body . Another one ? The drone ... it 's stuck . Look . Calm down . Everything 's going to be all right . It wo n't lift . Goddammit . Who was that ? I do n't know . What did he write ? Ammo ? No . ARR and then something . I think it said Anna . Who the hell is Anna ? Okay everyone , gather around . Here 's what we know . Three people are dead , at least . Something is clearly very , very wrong and we need to let the authorities know that we are here and alive . Now since it does n't seem to be dangerous in itself , and since whatever it is is no longer in the hallway . I suggest we send someone to the radio to call for help . I 'm not going in there . Me neither . Well someone has to . What about you ? You 're the leader here . I will . If my name is drawn . We 'll do a lottery . You ca n't force people to put themselves in danger . You have a better suggestion ? Or you prefer to run out to one of the cars and take your chances out there . Anyone ? Then that 's the way it 's going to be . Where am I going ? Another mile . Then a ... Then a right on Beacher . Does n't look as thick . Yeah . But why ? I do n't know . God . - Watch out ! - Help ! I need your help ! Please open up ! What do we do ? Get out of the car . Get out of the car . Okay . We just need the car . We just need the car . Okay . Get out of the car ! Slow down ! Slow down ! Mia , Mia , slow down ! Slow down , Mia ! Slow down . Slow down ! Slow down ! Brakes ! Is everyone okay ? I 'm just gon na need a minute . Me , too . Adrian , you okay ? I 'm fine . How 's my hair ? Improved . Shh . Shh . Shh . Shit ! Get the door ! Son of a bitch ! Open ! Watch the glass . I got you . Got you . What now ? We run . Run where ? The church . Where the hell are we ? There ! Wait ! The guns ! Mia . - Mia . - You 're not real . You 're not ... You 're not real . It 's just ... It 's just the withdrawal . That 's ... I miss you , baby doll . You 're not ... real . Come on . Let 's go ! Come on ! Mr . Copeland ! What 's going on out there ? I have no idea . Are you okay ? Yeah , I think so . Is help coming ? You ought to tell Clive he should start writing those circuit breaker assignments in pen , Father . You were supposed to wait for us . Calm down ... Who told you you could release my prisoners ? You left us to die in that cell ! - What are you even ... - Yeah ... Hey , Mia ! This is a house of God ! What the hell are you ... Take it easy . You want to be next ? Chief Heisel . Connor . - Come on . - Hey , Connor ! - Hey ! - Hey , take it easy . Connor . Try it again . I dare you . Yeah ? You think that 's gon na make me stop calling you a pussy ? ! Come on . Hey ! We could have been killed back there . I do n't have to explain anything to you . It 's your job to keep people safe . You left a 17yearold kid behind . I waited in the car like I said I would ! Then something attacked . I honked the horn again and again , but you never came ! Maybe because you were helping stage a prison break ! Yeah , well , like you said , it 's my job to protect people . I did n't want to start a panic . Then what is it ? What 's out there ? - Eve , I 'm sorry . - Jesus . - Mom . - Do n't worry . It 'll be okay . I 'll be back soon . Just tell me what I 'm doing so I can get this over with . You should n't go alone . Clint , please . I 'm going with her . The security office . It 's going to be okay . Going to be fine . It 's gon na be okay . I know . I want you to stay with Kimmi until I get back . I just need to know you 'll be watched after right now . I love you more than anything . I 'm so sorry about Benedict . Father Romanov told me . He was a wonderful man . He was mine since I was 18 . I mean , maybe he 's ... he 's still here ... in spirit ? Kevin , you 're smarter than that . There is no spirit . There 's just nature . There 's here and not here . He is not here . Ready Eve ? Yeah . All right . Run for it ? There . Okay . Now fingers crossed the battery still has enough juice . It has juice ! You okay ? It 's fine . It 'll be over soon . Thought you said you were n't a junkie . I thought you said you 'd help me . What 's it like ? Tell me . Maybe it 'll help . You know when you 're holding your breath and there 's that ... unbearable feeling right before you relent and take a gulp of air ? Well , imagine that feeling lasting for a week . I 'm sorry . Yeah , well , me , too ... I saw a person I used to know . Except she 's dead , so ... Heh . That 's what it does . Screws with your mind . Channel 19 , come in . Anyone on channel 19 ? Over . Channel 21 ? Anyone on channel 21 , come in . Over . Arrowhead , Arrowhead , do you copy ? Over . What 's Arrowhead . I repeat ! Arrowhead , Arrowhead ! This is Shadow 41 standing by for report . Over . What 's Shadow 41 ? How do you know how to ... We should take the radio back with us to the fountain . The radio stays here . Come in , Arrowhead , Arrowhead , this is Shadow 41 standing by for report . Do you copy ? Over . What 's going on ? I 'm going back . Not yet . Why do you have a gun ? Who are you ? Are you gon na have a service tonight ? I was n't planning on it . I 've just been thinking a lot about Revelations . That 's the way it is for a lot of people in this town . They need to hear your voice when they 're scared . Thank you , Link , for your concern , but one form of nourishment at a time . Please , wait for grace to be said . What if you do n't believe in God ? His house , His rules . Where 's Mrs . Raven ? She must have needed some time alone . In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , amen . Bless us , O Lord , in these , thy gifts , which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Jesus Christ , our Lord . In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , amen . Eve ! She 's back . She 's back . The radio work ? She okay ? Give her a minute , folks ... I 'm sorry . Did you see what it was ? And the radio ? It was n't working . We 'll find another way . Give us a minute . You ever seen those guys before ? In the mall ? Around town ? First time was this morning . Why ? I was thinking about their families . They must be worried sick . What do we do now ? Stay here for the night . Do you think Alex is okay ? I 'm sure she is . I 'm sure your parents are , too . Mrs . Raven . Mrs . Raven , please . That 's only for services . I 'd like to have a drink . I 'd like to make a toast for my husband . Let the woman have a drink . Actually , let all of us have a drink . Mikhail ? If God can forgive me for the things I 've done , I 'm sure He can also forgive this . Thank you . We had no money , no jobs . We were hippies and very happy about that . We had each other , and that was all that mattered . Our favorite thing was making spaghetti together and drinking cheap wine ... just like this . When we got older , we settled down here . We actually had money , but we never stopped drinking cheap wine . Benedict did n't want to forget those days when we were young and had the world in our pocket ... and neither do I .

You need to get the hell out of my office right now ! Okay , Sammy . I 'll be seeing you . Can I come out now ? Yes , you may . Oh , my . Wow . Sam . Right ? That was incredible ! Well , that 's how I do business , baby . Well , I , for one , am a fan . Mmm . Mmm . Oh , I like that about you , Sam . Mmm . Do you have a hard hat for me ? Oh , yeah , well , I ... I want a hard hat , baby . You can inspect all you want . Oh , God ... We have pancakes ... Mmm. ... egg scramble . Wow . Gluten-free ... muffins . Wow . It 's all so ... I do have a question . Mm . I enjoy making breakfast . ' Cause it seems like you either @!A)  : want intel on how miserableRoger is since you kicked him out , or B : want him to know how amazing you 're doing without him . Out of curiosity ... Mm-hmm. ... what would be the answer to those questions ? Well , if it 's " A , " Roger 's miserable . He 's making Riggs miserable , which , is in turn , making me miserable . And if it 's " B " ? If it 's " B , " you look fantastic , and I will happily tell him that . You do n't have to . I mean , if it comes up in the conversation . Is that a new dress ? You look like a million bucks . Mm . Um , 200 million , yes . That is the size of the dealI am closing today . My gosh , my boss is flying in from Dubai just for the ceremony to implode the building . If anyone asks , I never said that . Never heard it . Mm ? Scooby-Doo ... Good morning , sunshine ! Would you like some fresh coffee ? It 's French Roast and just how we like it . Okay . So here 's what I learned about you this week . You are not a morning person , which is okay . You know , most roommates ... they'renot that compatible . Try cellmates . Hmm ? Rog , cellmates . Which is exactly whyI 'm trying to turn this metal echo chamber into a home . Look ... new pillows , kitchenware . You know what ? One day , when I 'm gone ... Oh , God , please let that be today. ... you 'll be able to bring a woman over here . I do n't want to bring a woman over here . What do you not get ? I do n't want any other human being in my space ! Is that really so ? Sarcastic Roger , my least favorite Roger of all . A belt ... female . Toothbrush , obviously not yours . Got mouthwash , face wash , toner . It 's Molly 's stuff . I just have n't given it back to her . And-and , and-and why do you think that is so , Riggs ? Because I have n't run into her yet . Wrong answer . You want to try it again ? We talked about Game-Show Roger . You said you would n't doGame-Show Roger in the trailer . I lied . Look , you walked out on Molly with zero explanation . And now you 're avoiding her because you do n't know what to say . Look , Riggs , you want your roommate 's advice ? No . No , I do not want your advice . I do not want the advice of a man who is sleeping on my floor because he was evicted by the most patient woman on the planet . That 's totally different . How ? Because I 'm the wronged party . Oh , right . See , when Trish finally realizes this , she 's gon na welcome me back with open arms . And when might that be ? I think we need another one of these ... So , I 'm thinking of cooking tonight . How does pan-seared salmon sound ? Sounds like my trailer 's gon na stink again . Well , excuse me for trying to provide a healthy meal . Here 's a thought . Why do n't you cook tonight ? Or any night . I have an idea . I have an idea ... Am I sensing trouble at home ? Honestly , I did n't think you guys would survive two days . It 's a living nightmare . Yeah , it is . I 'll repeat my offer . You could stay with me , Murtaugh . I got a pretty sweet guest room situation . He 'll accept . Scorsese 's got cats . Ugh ... Our DOA is Sam Higgins , the contractor of this property . This was his office . Hmm . He wound up living in a metal box . I 'm sure it was just temporary . Oh , well ... I think I know why Sam 's pants were at half-mast . A clue . Guy was living in a sad , grimy trailer , away from his kids , and he died with his pants down . Ooh , careful , Rog . You 're two out of three . So , uh , please take us through what happened . Sam and I met on a dating site for ... 50-somethings . It 's like Tinder 's used car lot . Okay , let 's , uh ... let 's focus on last night . Um , so you were , uh ... hiding ... under Sam 's desk . And ... And this man came in the room , and Sam told me to stay put . And that 's when the yelling started . Could you , uh , see anything from down there ? Just his tassels . Okay , I thought " tassels " was a euphemism for ... Oh . I 've never heard that . Is it ? It is not . It 's not . Yeah , yeah . Is it ? Yes . Yeah . No . What ? The Brits say it . Mick Jagger . " I used to play with me tassels . " Anyway , moving on . Yes , please . Did you hear a name ? No , but he was a city inspector . He kept demanding a bribe , and Sammy refused . And then he left , and we thought it was all over . This thing happened ... Oh . You know , it 's ... it 's okay . We're-we're-we 're done here . You 've been through a lot . You did a great job . Thank you for coming in . You have no idea . You know , you get divorced at my age , and you think the grass is greener , there 's plenty of fish in the sea ... Thank you . Thank you , Officer . Wow . That 's a cautionary tale . Am I right ? What ? No . There 's no way possibleTrish will end up like that . I 'm not worried about Trish . Hello ? Uh , where are you ? Riggs ? Are you in my office ? I am , and you 're not here . So , that upsets me , considering I have stuffI need to talk about . Riggs , leave my office . We will schedule a session . Uh , this is a real emergency . I need to talk now . This is about Murtaugh again ? What is it now , a curtain dispute ? Uh , for your information , he 's making me feel bad about Molly . Oh . Okay . So , you 're feeling badly about how abruptly you ended things . No , no , no , he 's making me feel bad because I have n't talked to her since . Lying is usually better for no one . Wh ... Do you think Molly cares that we have n't talked in a few months ? I mean , we-we 've known each other for almost 20 years . Okay , this is what we do , all right ? We-we-we float in and out of one another 's lives , okay ? And we 're both good with that . Okay , then I guess the next time you see her , she 'll be totally cool . Exactly . No problem . Even you do n't believe that , Riggs . I can tell by your body language . My body language ? Yes . I am that good . Now , vacate the premises . Okay . Fine . Up top ? No ? Okay . What you looking at ? I 'm trying to find Murtaugh an apartment . Come on , Bailey , we gottawork together on this . I am . Which is why I found the inspector for our DOA 's construction site . Gary Filmore . He got a record ? His greatest hits ... assault , a little extortion , and he 's licensed in heavy machinery . His current job site . Text me this address . All right , last chance . Sure you do n't want to have a slumber party with your mentor ? Try Scorsese . Thanks a lot , Bailey . " Butler 's . " A butler ? Comes in , cleans up , cooks all of our food . I love it . Hire a butler . No , no , no , no . Butler 's Greens and Groceries . Why do I know that name ? I do n't know , they 're all over Texas . Hmm . Gary ? Gary Filmore , is that you ? How do I know you ? No . Yeah . So , we 're here to talk to you about why you drove a forklift through Sam Higgins after you extorted him . Now I 'm just down to two shirts . Y'all get out of here . What the ... ? Hey , hey ! What 's up , Gary ? Calm down , calm down . We just want to talk . Well , a little too late for that . Trish ? What are you doing here ? Uh , a little thing we like to call " Keeping America safe again . " No . No , what you 're doing is ruining my groundbreaking , Roger . Your gr-groundbreaking for what ? The deal I 've been working on for six months . Butler ! But ... th ... I knew it . Did n't I just say , " I know that name " ? I do n't remember you saying that . Remember , I was over there . You know what you could do , though . What ? You could apologize to your wife . What do you mean you 've done nothing wrong ? You 're living at my place , and you ca n't ... What is going on here ? It 's almost time to implode the building . No , we 're fine , Guillermo . My husband and his partner were just doing a last-minute security check , and , uh , they 're about to leave . Yes . Right . Yeah . You remember my boss . Absolutely . I hear Trish talk about you all the time . Welcome back . Thank you . Just flew in from Dubai to press the button . It 's like a bucket list thing . And this is Henry Butler . The grocery man . Hey . It 's a pleasure . The man , the myth , the legend , yes , sir . I love your cantaloupes . This man okay , here ? Oh , yeah , he 's just a murderer . Come on . Alleged murderer . We 're gon na ... Yeah , we 're gon na get ... hey . Well ... well , maybe I do have one thing or two to apologize for . So let me get this straight . Your story is that you ... Roger Mayfield Murtaugh ! The man flew 8,000 miles just to push the button . Your story 's that you threatened Sam , but you did n't kill him ? Yeah . This is unfixable . Are you gon na find another buildingfor him to blow up , huh ? Excuse me . You are unbelievable ! Yes , you ! You are unbelievable ! Can we lower the volume ? This is my place of business . I 'm sorry , am I disrupting your place of business ? Okay . Trish has a point . I 've experienced your tone-deafness often . But in all fairness , Trish , interrupting your eventwas an accident . Exactly . Now , can we agree it was a successful groundbreaking ? Ground was broken . All that was lost was a photo op . All ? Butler pulled out of the deal . You are unbelievable . An accident . Yeah . But if you want to talk about the motorcycle that you ran over , unapologetically ... No . No , stop . You 're embarrassing yourself . It 's what I do . Listen . How about I talk to Butler ? He 's still in the building . What ? He 's here ? Shenanigan central ? Uh ... why ? Our homicide vic was Butler 's contract . It 's protocol . Do n't worry , he 's in good hands . Whose hands ? All right , I got one for you , lunatic . How is a Longhorn like a possum ? Mm . Both play dead at home and die on the road . All right , all right , how about what do you get when you cross a groundhog and an Aggie ? I 'll bite . Six more weeks of bad football . Okay , what 's happening ? He 's not driving you insane ? Actually , he 's being very hospitable . Mm . For a Longhorn . I mean , it 's not his fault that his defense is terrible . You see that ? Now , he 's the first real guyI 've met in this city . Actually making me a tad bit homesick . He has that gift . Which is why I need to ask for my blueprints back . I got to head on back to Austin . Oh , no , no . Mr. Butler , there 's no better place than here for a flagship Butler 's . Please do n't pull out of the deal . Look , Trish , I understand your passion , and I appreciate that , darling , but you know , the juju just is n't right . My contractor was killed . Yeah , but , uh , LAPD has the killer in custody ... in record time , I might add . Actually , we do n't . Gary 's alibi checks out . He 's being released now . Uh , yeah , I-it 's not just my contractor ... bidding on the property ... Uh , I do n't know , something or other ... Ortega ? And besides , I need to be in a city where I can get a good Texas meal . You know exactly what I 'm talking about , do n't you , partner ? Hey , Mr. Butler . The best Texas barbecue I 've ever had is right here in Los Angeles . Well , thank you . Shut up , not you . I do n't believe you , son . Well , stick around for a night , give Trish here another opportunity , I 'll serve it up myself , make a believer out of you . I 'll tell you what , I 'll call my wife , tell her I 'm running late . You 're on , buddy . That was amazing . Are you sure about this barbecue ? Hundred percent . It 's Molly 's . I-I thought he was n't seeing Molly . He 's not . This needs to work . It 's gon na work . Right here . Here you go , sir . Thank you very much . Uh ... excuse ... oh , excuse me ... Here 's your change . Have a great day . Aw , thank you . Next . Hey ! Well , good golly , Miss Molly ! What can I get you ? Probably get that a lot . Hey , this is great , though . Right ? Congratulations . Oh , I also , uh , brought some of your ... some of your items from the house . Did n't know if maybe you 'd have a break , and maybe we could talk ? There 's a long line behind you . What would you like , sir ? Two meat combo , ribs and brisket . You got it . I mean , we 're good , right ? We do n't need to talk about everything . We 've known each other forever . I mean , we're-we 're floaters , right ? We-we float in and out of each other 's lives . I have a business opportunity for you . Not interested . You know the , uh , Butler grocery stores in Texas ? The owner wants to try your barbecue . Butler ? You know Henry Butler ? Having dinner with him tonight . And I promised him that you would cook for him ... hey ! Little something for the tip jar , bud . Yeah . That 's how you say thank you . So what do you say ? Murtaugh 's , 7:00 tonight . Come on , Molly , your-your seasonings could be in every grocery store across the country . Okay , if I do this ... What the hell is wrong with me ? I would not be doing it as a favor for you . No . Beautiful . Riggs . Can you ... See you tonight . Okay , Bailey checked the phone records . The Ortega brothers definitely called Butler . They must be the threatening phone calls he was talking about . So I 've got 5:05 . Okay ? We need to finish up here , get back to your place , shower , change and get to that dinner . Just relax . Everything 's gon na be fine . You-you listen to me . I 've never been more serious . I need to get back to my house . If this goes south tonight , I may be living with you forever . What time is it right now ? 5:06 . Let 's go . Miguel . You smell that ? Hmm ? I love the smell of fuel and motor oil . It reminds me of home . It sure does . Hmm . Hey , boys ! Officers , can we help you ? I 'm glad you asked . I 'd like to know why you drilled a forklift through a contractor named Sam Higgins . And make it quick , we 're , uh , on the clock . Yeah . You see , it was a big hole through the guy . I mean , the dude was a snake . Henry Butler ? So , let me get this straight , you guys killed Sam , and then , what , you just threatened Mr. Butler ? Is that right ? Wait , no , no , listen . We did n't kill nobody . I mean , it was n't worth it . We bought another spot . I believe him . You ? He 's got sincere eyes . Have a good day , gentlemen . Yep . The jack must be faulty . The jack must be faulty . Faulty jacks . Faulty ja ... happens all the time . Yeah , let 's take a look at that . Yep . Here we go . We 're gon na be late . Yeah . Oh , come on . Now I 'm down to one shirt . You need to shower . I do n't know why you took so long to get ready . It 's ridiculous . Well , some of us actually care how we look . Hi . Get in here . It 's his fault . Yeah , well , you know what ? We 're here . I 'm just gon na run this right upstairs . It 's fine in the foyer for now . Yeah , but do n't you want to have ... It 's fine in the foyer for now . You know what I 'm gon na do ? I 'm gon na go make sureMolly does n't need ... Nope . She said she does n't want you to . She specifically told me to tell you that . Classic Molly . That 's how we talk to each other . She ... Okay , you guys , this is not about you , and it 's not about you . Yes , ma'am . Butler is in the other room , and he is ready to leave on a plane for Texas at any moment . That 's ' cause he has n't tried the barbecue . Once he tries that barbecue , it ... So I have one night to sell Butler without alarming Azoulay . So there will be zero shenanigans . Say it . There will ... no shenanigans . Say it . Z-Zero shenanigans . That 's right . That bag better go upstairs . It 'll be upstairs . Zero shenanigans . You 're the one . You 're the one that has all the ... You 're Mr. Shenanigans . They really love the , uh , little barbecue sausage things . Did n't Trish tell youI specifically do not want your help ? She did . But I think what she meant to say was that ... I meant I do not want you out here. ... that since I kind of left abruptly without an explanation that maybe an apology was in order . What ? No . That is not what I want . And even if I did , I do n't want it now , when I am in the middle of cooking a potentially career-making meal . You disappeared . And now you just want to pop back in and explain yourself on your schedule . No . Listen , Molly , I ... No , you just listen . We 've known each other for over 20 years . But you hurt me . Molly ... And I do n't want to keep doing this , pretending we 're friends and-and you 're actinglike you 're helping me ... Molly. ... with some job . I mean , what is ... Molly . Molly . Molly ! What is it that you just ca n't keep yourself from saying ? ! Ribs . They 're ruined . I ruined them . W ... I 've got chicken in the fryer . Now I 've got to prep new ribs . You 're a landmine , Riggs . This is probably whyTrish wanted me to ... You are gon na go in there , stand by that fryer , and watch . When that chicken is gold , take it out . She goes all out , even when she 's nottrying to sell you something . How do you mean ? You 're doing that very thing this very moment . Uh , more wine , Mr. Butler ? Why would we be trying to sell you on a deal that 's already closed ? No , no , no , do n't say anything . Oh , I wonder where that chicken is . Yeah . The Ortegas were with theirPO at the time of the murder . They 're drug dealers , but they did n't kill Sam . However , I thought it was odd that they were willing to overpay for the lot where Butler was building his grocery stores . And ? I got them to spill . The lot sits over an abandoned subway tunnel . Perfect for cooking , storing and moving drugs . That 's perfect for a drug dealer , but ... why 's Butler willing to overpay ? Bailey , pull those blueprints for me . I already tried . They will be here imminently . Apparently , they 're being given a little extra love . Now , where was I ? Uh , gentlemen , can we not agree that there 's value to selling even after the original deal has been struck ? Take marriage , for example . Should n't a spouse have to prove his love to his wife every day ? And should n't he want to ? Trish . Hmm ? What is your Longhorn friend doing with my blueprints ? Roger . Roger 's gon na find out . Uh , he 's ... he 's so good with ... Riggs , this is coming very close to being categorized as a shenanigan . We need to give these plans back . Look , why was Butler willing to pay extra to build over these abandoned tunnels ? Because my beautiful wife , who 's on the verge of letting me back in my house , is a great negotiator . Or he 's up to something . Where is the vent ? Right here . There 's a massive ventilation system running through the basement . No , the truck , not the ... It 's a supermarket . Please , focus . See , this is what happens when people spend too much time together . You start not knowing what the words are . I do n't know what you 're saying . What if that 's why Butler 's venting the tunnels ? Underground meth lab . Look . What is going on in here ? Baby , how well do you know Butler ? No . No ! How well do you ... Hold on , Trish . No , I do n't want to hold on . Just look at the draw ... Trish , just look at the blueprint . Riggs ! What 's burning ? The chicken is done . That 's chicken ? I thought that was possum . What ... ? What are you doing ? Are those the same clothes you wore last night ? Oh , now I know what it feels like to be rock bottom . Another night in Riggs 's tin can , not even a toothbrush to my name . That 's a little dramatic , but okay . I thought you were back home . I was until Riggs decided that Butler is a meth dealer . Is he ? I do n't know . I did n't even get a chance to stick around because I was banished . Hey . Did n't you and Todd just add on to your house ? Right ? Oh , thank God . Bailey ! Urgent . Is everything okay ? Yeah . Murtaugh was just , uh , taking me through your , uh , Butler theory . Very promising . Really ? I thought it was pretty thin . How thin is it ? Skeletal . Okay , so if we can prove thatButler was cooking meth , that 's motive for murder . We can solve the case and save Murtaugh 's marriage . And if we do that by midnight , I still win . You win what ? The office pool . Do n't look at me . I already lost . So Molly was n't cool with things after all ? Well , I mean , in her defense , I mean , I did ruin everything . You know , I mean , ruined the ribs , burnt the chicken , almost burned down her truck . Sounds like quite the night . Well , it 's classic Riggs . At least you were trying . That counts for something . Does it ? I think so . Clearly you do n't . I just ... ... I 've been so selfish . You know ? Doc , I think I may have ruined something good ... something real . Well , everybody makes mistakes . He's-he 's just not sure . Man , tell him . Cap , I cracked this case wide open . With what ? Squash . What ? It 's like racquetball . It 's not like racquetball . I played in college . It is like racquetball . The balls are more dense . They do n't bounce . It requires finesse . Not the sport , the vegetable . According to this manifest , a truck of squash left Butler 's El Paso store weighing 20,000 pounds . But by the time it checked in at the next weigh station , it weighed 15,000 . So there 's 5,000 pounds missing . Well , either somebody got a big payday or a big boost in fiber . So , how do we prove the 5,000 pounds is meth ? We do n't . Oh , great . So I guess I 'll just have my mail delivered to Riggs 's now . But there may be another way . And that 's fraud , which is a good enough reason to get a search warrant and to call Trish . Come on . Now is not a good time , Roger . I am meeting Butler on his plane to try to save this deal . Trish , do not get on that plane . He 's dirty . Why ? Because the man wants a well-ventilated basement ? You have no proof of any of it . I have squash . Well , I think what you mean is squat , as in diddly , as in nothing . Nothing ! Listen , Trish , there are major discrepancies in Butler 's squash shipments . All that extra weight that he 's not declaring could be drugs . Or it could be kielbasa or it could be beach balls or it could be a typo . Listen , I do n't have time for this . I have to catch Butler before his plane takes off . I have to go . Bye . I ask you to take care of someone , you do it quietly . Heavy machinery ai n't quiet . Monster-trucking a guy with a big-ass fork ? Not quiet . I get it . Right . Thought I could make it look like an accident . An accident ? Well , how 'd that work out for us ? What were you thinking ? Huh ? Please do n't be a butt dial . Do n't be a butt dial . Hey , baby . Roger . Hey , you were right about Butler . You were right . Of course I am . Look , I 'm not the kind of guy who says I told you so , but baby , I told you so . Mrs. Murtaugh . Hello ? Trish ? Mr. Butler , I did n't see you there . Clearly . Plane 's ready for takeoff , Mrs. Murtaugh . Shall we ? Well , listen , I just got a call that I have some business I need to take care of this morning . I 'm a very busy man . Please . You know , I got to tell you , I apologize for interrupting your phone call . Hope it was n't too important . Actually , it was my husband . We were talking about you . Uh-huh . I was afraid that might be the case . Mr. Butler , I need to be honest with you . You really want to do this here ? I do n't think I 'll have a chance to do it again . The business you bought was rezoned last year and you are overpaying . Now , the reason we did n't disclose it was because it would cost us money . Now ... if you want to end it , I 'll understand . I ca n't believe the last thing I said to my beautiful wife , the mother of our children , is , " I told you so . " Well , you also ruined her grand opening . Is that Butler 's plane ? Come on . Come on , Rog ! Come on ! Hey ... no guns . What ? Yeah . A bullet could hit Trish . You do n't thinkI understand cabin pressure ? You do n't understand brushing your teeth , you do n't understandwashing your feet . What the ... I do n't see her . What do you mean ? I thought she was meetingButler on the plane . Hello . Trish . Roger ! Where are you ? Your phone keeps going to voice mail . I 'm 39,000 feet in the air . What ? ! Oh ... You 're on Butler 's plane ? Why are n't you ? Defense attorney . I talked my way out of it . I am safely in my car . Hey , do you mind ? Roger ! Do n't shoot ! I told you no guns . Hey , that was n't my fault . Uninvited guests once again , huh , fellas ? Some welcome . You might wan na take your finger off that trigger . These are Glaser safety slugs , designed for air marshals . What do you say we put the weapons down , boys , huh ? Slowly . Attaboy . Oh , Riggs ! It 's okay , Rog . Just relax , I got this , okay ? Of course you do . You 're a SEAL . You can land this thing in your sleep . With both hands tied behind your back , doing one-armed push-ups . Ai n't that right , baby-bubba ? I think the autopilot 's locked . Oh , I ca n't ... These things are much different than my crop dusters back in Texas , Rog . Oh , no , no , no , no ! Hey . Parachute . You got another one ? There 's only one . Oh , I ca n't go out like this , Riggs . Sorry , Rog . No ! Aw , just kidding . Help me find something to tether us together . I have a wife , I have kids that depend on me . You ... You do n't have nothing to live for , man . Hey ... what if I want that ? With Molly ? Yeah , I mean , you know , maybe I want , like , a house and , you know , like , a picket fence and ... yeah , maybe with Molly . That 's beautiful , Riggs . Thank you . You deserve that . I feel like I deserve it . You do . Rog , we 're running out of time . OkayOkay . You get ... Yeah , that 's it . Go , go , go . And you be the hero ? You take that . What are you talking about ? Just put it on and go . I do n't want it . I 'm not gon na take it . I 'm not gon na ... That 's the least of our worries , Rog . Riggs ! Help ! Pull the cord , Riggs ! Pull the damn cord ! Do n't take this the wrong way , Rog , but I need a little space . Tax fraud provided a warrant . I ca n't believe squash brought down a killer . It 's such an underrated vegetable . Not to mention sport . Now , the Texas Rangers are raiding meth labs in a dozen of Butler 's grocery stores . Speaking of a good haul ... Are those matching robes ? In the finest terrycloth . I finally have a houseguest . Murtaugh will want for nothing . They 're very plush , Scorsese . But I hope you kept the receipt . Why ? Oh , hey , sorry , I , uh ... left my duffle the other night . You jumped out of a plane . I know . There were ... It was crazy . But there were extenuating circumstances . No , no , no , Roger . You jumped out of a plane ... I miss you , too . Welcome back , baby . I 'm so sorry . I acted like a big fool . No . No , no , no , no . I 'm sorry . I should have never run over ... Hey , hey , hey ... It does n't matter . We both dug in . I know , I know I did . But not anymore . No ? From now on , I 'm letting everything go but you . Really ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we should go look for your duffle . I think I saw it somewhere in ... the bedroom . Ooh . Ooh . I missed you . Excuse me , can I get a brisket sandwich ? Oh , we 're all out for the day . We 'll see you tomorrow , though ? Sorry about that . Not now . Just give me five minutes , and I 'll get out of your hair ? You got two . I owed you an explanation when I ended things . You treated me like regular people . I know . You broke my heart . I thought I was doing the right thing . Okay . Thanks for the apology . Molly . Hey ... Hey , hey , hey . Are we good ? Yeah , sure , Riggs , we 're good . Just , you know , consider us friends again . I do n't want to just be friends . Okay ? I want more than that . Okay , well , then I 'm gon na need to know more . I need to know why . Why did you end it ? Because my dad killed Ben 's dog . Why did n't you say something ? What do you mean why did n't I say something ? Molly , I was trying to protect you and Ben . Okay , okay , so you say you want me back . Well , what now ? What 's changed ? I 've changed . You tell me what you want me to do , and I 'll do it . He walks into your life , and you smash up everything you 've worked so hard for . And it hurts people . I mean , he 's never gon na go away , so how are you gon na live your life ? I do n't know . Well , you need to figure it out with your dad . That 's what I want

Come on . Damn it ! Back up , turn around . Let 's go . Let 's go ! Hang on . Come on . I need my shirt . Follow me . Let 's go . You need a doctor . No , listen , I 'm fine . You got to work with me , okay ? Whatever I say , -just go with it . Can you do that ? -Okay . Hey . Hi . I 'm Pete Erickson . This is my daughter , Stella . We 're brand-new to the school , and , ugh , I 'm such an idiot . I forgot everything . I forgot about the field trip , her-her T-shirt , her lunch . I 'm just trying to get used to this whole single dad thing . Oh , it 's just the two of you ? Yeah . My mom ran off with her trainer . He 's 27 . Oh , sweetie . They do n't need to knowthe whole story . Has his own YouTube channel . Okay , great . All right . Hey ... Okay , sweetie , have fun . All right . Thank you . Bye , Dad . Bye . No phones on the bus . Oh . Oh , I ... Hey , I would n't ... I would n't do that if I were you . I hate the way she looks at me . Well ... quit-quit looking at her . Hey ! I 'm in charge of Babcock , you 're in charge of Fanning . All right ? Worry about him . Mortality rate 's almost 30% . ... First few cases have been reported in North Korea . They 've closed the airports in Beijing . This is terrifying . Not as terrifying as the solution we 've come up with . What 's going on with the child ? Still in the wind with the agent . Well , I 'm rooting for them . Well , I 'm rooting for all of us . Jonas , I had to make the call , so I did . We 're isolated , cut off from everyday life . We 're not qualified to decide what 's right or wrong ... ' cause we do n't know the difference anymore . Where are we going ? I 'm trying to figure ... figure it out . Are you okay ? You look awful . No , I 'm good . We 'll just ... I just need to stop for a second . Is this the guy who took your phone ? Yep . Can I get that number ? It 's not my phone . You just said he took your phone . It 's my sister 's phone . I just had it for the field trip . Okay , can I get your sister 's number ? I do n't know my sister 's phone number . How about your mom ? She 's on speed dial on my sister 's phone . Go back to your teacher . Get the mom 's phone from the schooland track the damn thing . It 'll be an older model . No GPS . Yeah ? Hi . Wolgast and the kid are still on the run . Police station was a disaster . Sheriff was killed and three of my men . Well , so much for making the world a better place. -Should we consider finding another child ? -No . Wolgast is gon na talk , and if he does , this whole operation gets shut down . He 's injured . He 's got the kid with him . I 'll find him . Okay . Be careful . Should we tap the ex-wife 's phone ? Yeah . Do it . Surgery went well . We repaired the tendon . I 'm happy . Just need you to rest , and we 'll see you in a few weeks . So , basketball in a few months , yeah ? Oh , hell no , Nathan . We talked about this . You can play chess . That 's a sport . Look it up . Dr. Wolgast . You have a call . -Okay . All right . This is Dr. Wolgast . I think he might be dead . What ? Who ? Who is this ? This is Amy Bellafonte . The agent 's with me . We tried to turn ourselves in , but then some guys with guns came in , and the agent got shot , and he passed out , and I think he might be dead . And everyone 's a bad guy , so I did n't know who to call . Okay , okay . Okay , Amy , I 'm glad you called . That was really smart of you . Look , I need you to take a deep breath . Everything is gon na be all right . Say that back to me . It 's gon na be all right . Now , can you tell if he 's breathing ? Put your hand on his chest . Is it moving up and down ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay , he 's alive . But I just ... I need you to look , okay ? Is it still bleeding ? It 's stuck to it . It 's all dried . Okay . Good . It means it stopped , so just leave it . Do you see any signs ? Do you know where you are ? It says " Tomah , La Crosse. " " 14 West . " You 're in Wisconsin . Hey , I think the agent 's gon na be okay . But we need to wake him up . Do you know what a noogie is ? Yeah . All right . Make a fist and rub your knuckles in his chest super hard so it hurts . What the hell ? What 'd you do that for ? Your ex-wife told me to . Wh-What ? Let me talk to him . She wants to talk to you . Hello ? What is going on ? Lila , no . This is not your concern . How is it not my concern ? You 're injured . You passed out . You 're not involved in this . Just tell ... Damn it . Get in the car . So , this is it ... just one dose ? Just one dose . Then what 's the chip in my neck for ? Monitors your vital signs . Tells us your location . Sensitivity to sunlight is a side effect ? Can be . But , if all goes well ... you 'll be impervious to disease . How is any of this legal ? It 's not , is it ? If this was on the up-and-up , you guys , you would n't be looking for prisoners to experiment on . We 're in a desperate situation , Mr. Carter . So are you . I ca n't argue with that . But why am I more scared now than I was on death row ? I 'm gon na make sure you come through this with flying colors , Mr. Carter . I 'll be back to check on you in a bit . I could never have imagined any of this . All right , I 'm gon na say this one more time . Please do not bring Tim Fanning into this . He is an egomaniacal , credit-grabbing monster , with a substance abuse problem . We 've been friends with him since college . When 'd you turn on him ? I just hate to see you grovel . I 'm not groveling . You know why I 'm doing this . Oh , no , no . Do not blame this on me . We 're doing this for you . Why ca n't you see that ? Because it 's a Hail Mary and it 's crazy . I have to do something , Liz . Come here . You 're all crooked . Help me . You know I hate ties . I know , I know . You ca n't change this , Jonas . If you want to help me ... stay with me . That 's what I want . I know . Are you sad that you married me ? Yes . Really ? No . I love you . I love you , too . All right , hang on . Hang on . Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality . So all those amazing neurons are generating your experience . They're-they 're filling in the gaps . Your sense of self ... That 's not real . What we think of as our humanity , as our-our selves ... That 's just a story that our neurons are telling us . Now , this is extremely hard for me to swallow because I have an enormous ego . Jonas , I 'm not interested . I 've got a book tour . I 'm not going to South America to-to look in some cave with you for a myth . Thank you , but no . I have new evidence . Oh , yeah ? The 250-year-old man , he send you a selfie ? Elizabeth has Alzheimer 's . When was she diagnosed ? Three months ago . It 's ... I mean , she 's gotten lost in the city , like , three times already . Why did n't you call me ? I 'm a neurologist , for God 's sake . This Bolivia thing ... It could help her . I have a blood sample , some scientist in Bogot . You really have to see it . It 's a game changer . Hey . No more phone calls , okay ? You threw the phone out of the window . Yeah . I threw the phone out of the window because they can find us if you make a phone call . Do n't you watch TV ? I watch a lot of TV , actually . Usually the main guydoes n't pass out behind the wheel . I 'd like to point out that the main guy got shot . Where are we going ? Do you have a plan ? I have a friend in Wisconsin . You have a friend ? Something wrong ? No . Lila seems nice . Yeah . Smart , too . Mm-hmm . Hey , what is your problem ? I do n't know . I 've been kidnapped , shot at and chased , and the last thing I 've had to eat in 24 hoursis churros and doughnuts . Hey , that ... -No . You had a hot dog at the carnival. -And then you decided it 'd be a great time to pass out . I did n't decide to pass out . You said you would n't leave me . I did n't leave you . Passing out was leaving me . I thought you were dead . I 'm not dead . Good . ' Cause you do n't get to die , and you do n't get to pass out . And you do n't get to not have a plan . Okay . And you owe me a unicorn . Fine . Fine . Do I get anything out of this deal ? You do n't leave me and I do n't leave you . She likes things a certain way . The goats ... the goats are new . I do n't know anything about the goats . Whoa , whoa . All right , cover your ears . Put your hands up . Come on , come on . Bradley ? What the hell happen to you ? I got shot . Well , that 's disappointing . Who 's the kid ? This is Amy Bellafonte . Hi . Amy , you want to go wash up ? Bathroom 's upstairs . Okay . Thank you . You got a lot of firepower here , even for you . Is it enough for whatever 's following you ? It 's that sketchy job , is n't it ? I told you not to take that . I need shelter , Lacey . I raise goats now . Oh , yeah ? How 's that going for you ? Make my own cheese , grow most of my own food . Also , I started painting . That all sounds magical . Pain killers , too . And then you 're gon na read me into whatever mess you got yourself into . Listen up . He crossed into Wisconsin three hours ago . I got to think he 's headed for Canada . The border patrol has been alerted , but he is slippery , and he has friends . I want to be clear . If you have a shot , take it . Shoot to kill . I got Carter 's blood work . Looks like his T and B cell receptors have already enhanced . That 's good news . Look . He-he had a football injury , and all that cartilage is already restored . He got the formula less than five hours ago . It always takes my breath away , -the power of what you discovered. -Yep . And yet we ca n't seem to control it . Nichole ... let 's please not do this . Let the little girl go . Jonas ... she 's gon na come through . She wo n't be harmed . We have to do this . So we have to make sure she comes through intact . Please , Jonas , get your head in the game . She needs you . I need you . Let 's see this thing through . The thing you started . Oh , my God , this is fascinating . Just take a look at the number of T and B cell receptors in there . Yeah , I know . Never seen anything like this . This is huge . This could alter the course of Elizabeth 's Alzheimer 's . Jonas , this ... could be the cure for everything . Can we be fast enough , though ? Yeah , we will . I know , like , six billionaires who 'd bankroll this today . We just need to be careful . We want to maintain control . Jonas , we 're gon na do everything right , I promise . Okay ? You just ... Thank you . This is amazing . Jonas , we 're ... we 're gon na change the world . Yeah , you 'll see . How do you know the agent ? Bradley ? He was my student in the Navy . Land warfare . He was one of my favorites , but do n't tell him that . You were in the Navy ? Yep . But you 're not anymore ? Nope . What , did you join it right after high school ? Actually , no . Before I was in the NavyI was a nun . You 're serious ? God is Lacey 's ex-husband . How do you know God 's a man ? Ex-wife , then . You know about this ? Bradley knows everything about everyone . He asks questions . That 's what made him a good hostage negotiator . Like in bank robberies ? And other high-stakes negotiations , yes . Pretty fascinating , Amy . Amy , you want to go and feed some goats ? Sure . Yeah , I 'm not gon na come . How did you know I was here ? Well , who else do you know in Wisconsin ? Oh , man . I got rid of your car , Bradley . What 'd you do with it ? I got a guy . Huh . I forgot about your grilled cheese . It 's one of your best qualities , this sandwich . Thanks . Where 's Amy ? Upstairs , watching a movie . There you go . I , uh , arranged a boat ride for you . I can get you to Canada . Passports ? I got a guy who can get you across the border . You always got a guy . What are you gon na do once you get to Canada ? You know it 's not over just because you cross the border . If they keep chasing us , we 'll just go to Amsterdam . Amsterdam ? Sure . These people are never gon na stop , Bradley . They can get to Amsterdam . They 'll just find another child , wo n't they ? That 's right , and that child will have just as sad a story as our Amy . Now you think about that for a minute . I do n't want to be a whistleblower , Lacey . I tried that , we almost got killed . Then let me do it . I have some things to atone for , as you know . You get the girl safe and I 'll get the story out . Give me their names , Bradley . The 12 on death row . Who are they ? Joseph Morrison . Victor Chavez . Kathy Turrell . David Winston . Julio Martinez . Shauna Babcock . Anthony Carter . Hey , you made it . I 'm sorry , do I know you ? Yeah , you do . You will . Uh ... okay . So how do you feel ? Honestly , I feel like a million bucks . Everything is okay if you just do what he says . Do what who says ? Hello , Carter . How are you ? You look great . Does n't he ? So , how is my old friend Jonas ? A little word of advice : do n't trust him . Go on . Drink it . You know what ? Nah , I 'm good . Just do it . First time 's the hardest , and then you get to like ... I said no . It 's okay . You do n't have to drink it now . You still have to settle up , though . I 'm sorry . I do n't ... I do n't have any money . Oh , we do n't take money here . Oh . Wait ... You pay with yourself . I do n't ... I do n't want a thing to do with you . Let 's not throw in a staph infection . How 's Dave ? Is it Dave or David ? It 's David . Mm . Of course it is . How is David ? He 's great . He 's outside waiting in the car , actually . Oh , yeah ? Mm-hmm . Did you crack a window for him ? Oh , sorry . So , what 's the timeline on this " having David 's baby " thing ? You pregnant already ? No . I 'm not . It kind of seems like you are , though . You know , what are you gon na do ... Run away with this girl and make her pancakes inAmsterdam on Saturday mornings ? Yes . I watched our daughter die . I could n't stop it . And I shut down , and ... and I could n't help you . And I could n't let you help me , and then I j ... I just stopped believing in anything . Just like Eva . Like Eva , yeah . So much . She does n't have anybody . And it 's so clear to me that what I 'm supposed to do right now is to make sure that she 's safe . It 's the only thing that 's made sense to me in a long time . I 've missed you . Psst. -00 a.m . Ca n't sleep ? Mm-mmm . Me neither . Can I ask you a personal question ? Yeah . Are you an assassin ? No . Okay . ' Cause you assassinated some people today . I served in Afghanistan . And , uh , then I became a federal agent . And ... It was pretty scary today , huh ? Can I ask you another personal question ? Sure . Do you believe in God ? You thinking about your mom ? Of course you are . You know , when people die , it 's our job to remember them . Even if it hurts . Okay . From the beginning ? Yeah . Mm . Flashlight . Oh . Okay . Here we go . " It was a dark and stormy night . " In her attic bedroom " Margaret Murry , " wrapped in an old patchwork quilt , " sat on the foot of her bed " and watched the trees tossing in the frenzied lashing of the wind . " And you do n't know how this got on your bed ? I got a notice to pick this car up . That 's all I know . Where you taking it ? To the impound , where I take ' em all . That 's my job . And you do n't know who called this one in ? It got sent through dispatch . I do n't know who called them , so can I go or what ? I think you know exactly who asked you to transport this car . Tell me now . I do jobs for her sometimes . She pays me in cash . I want a name . Lacey . They see it as a wayto combat infectious disease . Tim , this-this timetableis insane . Do n't you see ? We go with the guys who make the rules so we can break the rules . What-what are you saying ? I 'm talking about a fast track . You 're talking about tossing ethics in the garbage . Elizabeth ... this is for you . No , this is for you . I want you to stay with me . And you 're either going to fail or you 're gon na cross some ethical line that you 've worked your whole life to uphold . You will look back on this with searing regret , and you wo n't have me to talk to about it , because this disease is going to have its way with me no matter what you do . Mr. Carter , how are you feeling today ? I just did six miles , and I felt like I could 've kept going forever . Maybe I can get something for that ? A sleeping pill ? Sure . Anything remarkable about your dreams ? Yeah . It 's the same guy every time . And I think you know him ... That Dr. Tim Fanning . He says he 's a friend of yours , but that I should n't trust you . He says to tell you that ... you already changed the world . You just have to wait and see how . Hey , honey . You look beautiful . Sorry I 'm late . I 'm not having a great day . Everything 's spinning out of control and , uh ... ... and it 's all my fault . You were so right . I think I may have missed ... a lecture . But nobody here will tell me what day it is . I miss you so much . Hey , baby . You miss me ? I ... I thought they pulled you off the floor . Not enough bodies . Lucky me . No cell phones , no Wi-Fi . Only good thing about this place ... It 's about the last place in the world you can still call a bitch a bitch . ... All right , all right , stop , stop . Come on , let 's go . Let 's just go . We 're done here , man , come on .

Come on , come on . We 're doing it. -No ... -No , no ! No. -Come on . Come on . It 'll be fun . Come on , come on . No , no , no ! No , I can't-I ca n't ... No , let me go .

@@5248341 All right , here we go . Next bucket wins . Check . All right , hold on . I got ta tie my shoe . So , how are you and Natalie doing ? I see what you 're doing . It 's not gon na work . Seriously . I just wanted to see if you two are getting along . Seriously , things have never been better . I 'm a lucky guy . Now quit stalling . Well , I 'm glad you did n't screw things up. ' cause you can be a real knucklehead . What 's that supposed to mean ? Yes ! Ethan , this way . What the hell happened ? Uh , this guy , I think he OD 'd . You should 've called 911 . Look around . Last thing I wan na do is get anyone in trouble . Em , it 's 7:00 a.m . What are you even doing here ? I was out dancing with my friends . Got invited over here after . Do n't you have work today ? Ethan , do n't worry , I 'll be there ... what did you take , huh ? Does anyone know what he took ? Heroin . He 's choking . Oh , God . I ca n't clear it . Em , see if you can find a pen . What ? Why ? He 's not breathing . He needs a surgical airway . Hey ! Here , got one . Unscrew the top . I 'm in . He 's breathing . Unfortunately , I have to bring up last week 's mass casualty incident , because in the chaos , it seems 40 pills of Percocet disappeared from the medication dispensary . That 's a street value of $2,500 . Someone took advantage of that situation . So , we will be implementing new protocols to prevent that from happening in the future . Keep your eye out for a memo in the next few days . Any questions ? Good . Back to work . Go to Four . Tracy Herman , 25-year-old female. 21 weeks pregnant . GCS , 14 , dyspneic . This is her mother , Pam . All right , Tracy , I 'm Dr. Manning . Can you tell me what happened ? I do n't know . We were having breakfast and she just collapsed . All right , let 's transfer her and put her on the monitors . On my count , ready , one , two , three . Any pain or discomfort ? No . Breath sounds are clear and present bilaterally , but I am hearing a systolic murmur . What does that mean ? It 's probably the pregnancy putting a strain on your heart . Have you had any bleeding ? Uh , just some spotting , but my OB said it 's normal . It can be . Uh , Doris , let 's get a fetal ultrasound , uh , chest X-ray , and call up toCardiology for an ECHO , okay ? All right , Tracy , just try to relax . All right , we 're gon na do everything we can to figure this out , all right ? Thank you . Yeah . Oh , goodie . Lime flavor today . Your last set of labs look good . If everything holds for the next 24 hours , they 'll put you back on solid foods . Whoo . Wonderful news . I also told her about your nausea . She 'll be over in a few minutes with some ondansetron . Sarah ? I know I have n't said it enough , but ... thank you . I ca n't tell you how grateful I am for all you 've done for me since the transplant . No , just , uh , one more thing . It looks like I 'll still be in rehab for a while . Uh , I have n't checked my mail since all this happened . I 'm sure the bills are piling up . You want me to run to your apartment ? Unfortunately , I have no one else to ask . All right , but it 'll have to wait a few hours . Dr. Charles and I have rounds at Cohn County . The jail ? Ooh , sounds fascinating . All right . I made a short list of things I need . If you do n't mind . " No clues to mystery surrounding " missing college co-edsSearch for Indiana girl goes on . " This poor young lady , Olivia Coveny , seems to have disappeared from the Madison campus , what , about ten years ago ? " Wisconsin girl missing . " What am I looking at ? Seems like somebody is trying to make a case that Robert Haywood is a very bad guy . Sarah Reese 's father ? Yeah . Well , I mean , apparently , he was a visiting lecturer at all of these colleges at the same time that these women disappeared . And you do n't know who sent you this ? Nope . Somebody slipped it under my door . Apparently , somebody knows that I 'm working with Robert Haywood . I think if you think there 's something there , you should turn it over to the police . Turn what over to the police ? It 's all completely circumstantial . You have n't shared this with Dr.Reese yet , have you ? Absolutely not . We set up Baghdad as soon as you called . How 's he doing ? Got an ET tube in on the right , but held off on the naloxone . They do n't want him waking up with a tube in his neck . But he needs a better airway . Get me a number eight trach tube . You ready to get him on the monitors ? All right , we 're gon na transfer him on my count . Everybody ready ? One , two , three . I 'm in . Bag him . BP 's dropping . 88 over 50 . All right , he 's still intoxicated . We need to reverse him . Push 2 milligrams of naloxone IV . How 's Jeremy ? It 's gon na take time for the drugs to clear from his system , but he should be okay . Heroin ? What was she thinking , going to that party ? I 'm not sure she was thinking . Hey . How was the game ? I 'm filing a protest with the league commissioner . So you lost ? Dr. Manning ? Yes ? Imaging results from your pregnant patient in Treatment Four . You better page CT surgery . Yeah . Maggie ? Yeah ? Okay . Now , the access to the atria of both hearts . We 're ready to clamp . Left is clamped . And the right ... Dr. Bekker will now perform the separation . Scalpel . Josh , have peeds surgery ready . What 's happening ? Heart rate 's diving . The twins are bradying down . Dr. Bekker ? I do n't know , my incision was superficial . Step aside . Heart rate 's down to 44 . There 's no bleeding . We have n't cut near any major vessels . We need to push atropine . No , it 's too late . Congratulations , Dr. Yes , we did . I do n't know what happened . That 's why we conduct these exercises , Dr. Bekker , so that we can predict all outcomes and make the necessary adjustments on game day . Dr. Frisch , my team will evaluate our approach and determine what went wrong . We 'll gather again this afternoon and resume the procedure . I 'd like all possible scenarios on my desk before lunch . Yes , Dr. Latham . Keep your chin up . You 'll figure it out . You know , you do n't have to do that . What ? Act like you do n't enjoy seeing me on the hot seat . Go ahead and buy it . If I were in your position , I would . Dr. Rhodes , Dr. Bekker , they need you in the ED . Okay . You 're saying I have damage to my heart ? Uh , to be specific , it 's your mitrovalve . But she 's never had any problems with her heart before . In all likelihood , Tracy was born with a defect , and it just did n't show any symptoms until now . Um , the baby has apparently added strain to your heart , which has caused it to present itself . We 'll need surgery to replace the defective valve . Oh ... Okay . There are ... potential complications . Complications ? Due to your pregnancy , the medication needed to conduct the surgery could cause a life threatening vaginal bleed , and given that your fetus has n't reached viability ... Wh ... what are you saying ? We think it 's best for your health if you terminate before undergoing surgery . What ? No . You do n't understand . Her husband , Roy ... we lost him in a car accident three months ago . We had just got the news that I was pregnant . He was so excited . He wanted this so bad . Honey , please ... listen to the doctors . No . No ! This baby is all I have left . I wo n't let you take it from me . The patient understands that , without surgery , condition could be fatal ? Yeah , we explained the risks . Well , so , your concerns are certainly justified . We need blood thinners to keep the bypass pump for clotting . Hm . Have you considered a minimally invasive valvuloplasty ? Yes , but due to the level of stenosis and the presence of regurgitation , we do n't feel that she 's a candidate . We have to open her chest . What if there is another option ? What ? If we lower the dose of the blood thinners and use a heparin-coated bypass tube , there is a chance that we could save both mom and baby . According to Dr. Manning , Tracy 's Level Two ultrasound showed placenta previa , which puts her at an even greater risk of developing a serious bleed . Do n't we have an obligation to honor the patient 's wishes ? So , we should let the patient 's emotional involvement impact our medical decisions ? I think we owe it to her to give it a shot , yes . With close monitoring , it is possible to stay ahead of any bleeding . Dr. Rhodes , if you believe that this is the best course of action , please proceed . Thank you . Well ... good luck . Are you taking her up to surgery ? Yeah . I 'm worried about her . Connor 's taking a big risk . Hey , you two , Treatment Six . Okay . Hi . You must be Cody . What 's his temp ? 102 . He 's been like this for over a week . Uh , I 've had him onTamiflu , bed rest , fluids . We 've tried everything . He ... he just keeps getting worse . It 's been an ... an extremely harsh flu season . I 've been spared so far , I-I assume ' cause I was vaccinated . And what about Cody ? Uh , unfortunately not . No , I-I know what you 're thinking . It 's not like that . Uh , Cody has a ... A long list of allergies . Last year , he had a severe reaction to the vaccine . I-I did n't wan na put him through that again , you know ? I understand , all right . It makes sense why you did n't wan na get him vaccinated . Let 's get a CBC , CMP , and a chest X-ray , okay ? I promise we 're gon na do everything we can to take care of your son , okay ? We 'll be back soon . All right ... couple of more seconds and I 'll have the valve free . No evidence of bleeding . Good . There . Got it . All right , let 's get a sizing tool . Let 's open a21-millimeter porcine valve . Manufacturer had some production delays with that size valve . It 's on backorder . But I have a mechanical . Can we get one from another supplier ? Sure , but it 'll take an hour or morefor a rep to get here . Marty ? With any other patient , maybe , but every minute this woman 's on pump reduces her chances of maintaining this pregnancy . Okay , then let 's open the mechanical valve . Mechanical valve means she 'll need heparin post-operatively . She 'll be more likely to bleed . We need to wait for a porcine . You heard what Marty said . This baby does n't have an hour . We do n't have a choice . Thank you again for stopping . It saves me so much time . Right on the way back from Cohn County . Pretty easy . I 'll only be a couple of minutes . You know , it 's a pretty hefty list your dad left for you . I 'll go pack some clothes . He said he wanted a book or two ? Yeah , I think his office is down the hall . Dr. Charles , you ready ? Yeah . Do you have a book ? Right over here . You made it ... on time . Do n't act so surprised . How 's he doing ? Stable for the moment . Uh ... listen , about this morning ... thanks for being there . Yeah . Guess I better get to work . I 'll check in later . You hear about the missing Percocet ? Yeah , I 'm not surprised . It was a chaotic day . You know , I hate to even mention this , but ... Do you know how expensive they are ? April , you 're the one that keeps telling me to give her a chance . Did Emily show poor judgment this morning ? Absolutely . But this kid OD 'd on heroin , not Percocet . Is there something else about Emily I 'm missing ? No , uh ... I 'm sorry . Forget I mentioned it . Okay . So , get this , it turns out thatRobert Haywood did know one of those co-eds that disappeared : Olivia Coveny . Oh , yeah ? The one from Madison , yeah , was his student . And I saw a picture of ' em together this morning at his apartment . Wait a minute , you ... you went to his apartment ? Sarah and I were doing rounds at the jail this morning , and she needed to pick up some of this stuff , and so we just stopped on the way back . But what happened to , " We 're gon na forget all about it " ? She asked for my help . And , by the way , part of me says , " So they knew each other . So what ? Student , you know , teacher . " But the thing is is that in the picture , he had his arm around her . Well , have you considered calling t-he Madison Police Department ? No , I did . The detective I talked to , I do n't know , he just did n't seem that interested . You know , ten years ago , it was a cold case . Mm . If I only had , like , two more minutes in that apartment . Daniel ... What ? Be careful . Sats are dropping . What 's happening ? Respiratory failure . Bag him. 20 of etomidate , 100 of sux . We need to intubate now . Sats are down to 87 . Nat ... I 'm almost there . Oh , God ... 82 . I 'm in . Dad ? Oh , Sarah . She 's even lovelier than you said . Thank you . I should probably get going , but , um ... thank you , Robert . This has meant so much to me . As to me . What was that all about ? That ... was the widow of my heart donor . She had asked to meet me . I admit I was reticent about the whole thing , but , surprisingly ... it felt good . Sats are still in the tank . Nitric oxide did n't work . Neither did low volume ventilation . Where 's the mom ? She went to grab a cup of coffee . We should get him up to the PICU . I called already . They do n't have an isolation room available . This flu epidemic is wreaking havoc . It 's time to consider ECMO . Yeah . Hey , uh , what do you think of this ? A rash ? Mm-hmm . It 's not abnormal . Choi , we need you . He 's having a seizure . Push 2 of Ativan . All right , take it easy , take it easy . His eyes are icteric . There 's something wrong with his liver . From the heroin ? Not likely . Did we get his labs back ? I think they came in a few minutes ago . Okay . Positive for acetaminophen . That 's in Percocet . Uh , let 's also start a NAC , 140 milligrams per kilogram . Okay . April , what you said about the missing drugs ... Oh , forget it , I should n't have gone there . Actually , you should 've . I thought this kid OD 'd on heroin , but his labs came back positive for both opioids and acetaminophen . I ca n't tell it 's exactly what he took , but ... the most likely source isPercocet , our missing drug . You thought from the beginning this could be a possibility . Why ? I do n't know . She cleaned up and cooked dinner . She also had some people over . I found an ash tray full of cigarette butts in the bathroom . You did n't think I should know ? I just ... I wanted you two to get off on the right foot . She begged me not to say anything . I 'm sorry . I should 've told you . Yeah . I 'm gon na go talk to her . Maybe she 'll come clean to me . No . She 's my sister . I 'll do it . Dr. Charles , what a pleasant surprise . Dr. Haywood , just wanted to ... To stop by , see how you 're doing . Well , I wo n't be running a marathon any time soon , but I 'm getting along much better . You know , Sarah told me you spent some time up in Madison . I had no idea . Yeah . I spent a few semesters . I do n't know , worth my time ? Worth the trip ? I found Madison to be a bit , uh , claustrophobic . Good to know . Good to know . Could you do me a favor ? Course . Would you mind ... getting me a book from that box ? Yeah . Ha , Grisham . Well , Sarah does n't know me very well . All right , Dr. Haywood , time for your exercises . Sorry to cut this short , Dr. Charles . I hope you 'll stop by again soon . You can count on it . The surgery was a success . We managed to replace your valve and stave off any bleeding . And the baby ? The baby pulled through just fine . Thank you , Dr. Rhodes . Thank you . I 'll be back to check in on you soon , see how you 're doing , okay ? Dr. Rhodes , good work . Things broke our way this time . Nonetheless , well done . Bekker and I suspect it was the placement of the clamps that caused the problem , but we 've already confirmed that the coronary vessels and vagus nerve were not affected . What about the sinoatrial node ? We had n't considered that , given its location . Well , the anatomy of these hearts is highly irregular , so it 's possible that we clamped the SA node and it cut off the heart 's electrical activity . So are you suggesting moving the L.A. clamp laterally ? Worth a shot . Ah ... Dr. Rhodes , why do n't we test your theory before the next simulation ? Meet me in the lab in an hour . Okay . I take it that means good news for Tracy and her baby ? You know what they say , right ? Fortune favors the bold . Catheter 's in good position . Let 's double-check circuit tubing , and set goal flow at 35 to 40 ccs per kilogram per minute . I was lucky there was an ECMO available ... I do n't think we should put him on ECMO . Why not ? The rash on Cody 's IV site , given his history of intense allergic reactions ? I think he may have undiagnosed systemic mastocytosis . You 're jumping to that from a rash ? Kids with mastocytosis generally produce an overabundance of histamine . If Cody has it , passing his blood through the machine could send him into anaphylactic shock . Given the state his lungs are in , he would not survive that . Mastocytosis is extremely rare , Natalie , and we do n't have time for a biopsy to confirm it . Dr. Halstead , we 're ready . All right . What about PLV ? Partial liquid ventilation ? I thought that was reserved for preemies . There have been some clinical trials with encouraging results . PLV 's a good idea , in theory . I ... I 'm not sure we should be risking a kid 's life by using a treatment that 's unproven . Stop . We 're not putting him on ECMO . Wait a minute , you ... you 're saying you wan na drown my son ? I assure you , Karen , Cody will not drown . But you ... you ... you 're gon na fill his lungs with fluid . It 's called Perflubron . It has unique properties , including the ability to hold large amounts of oxygen . Yeah , at this point , Cody 's lungs are too damaged to absorb oxygen through the air , so our hope is that this treatment helps oxygen penetrate Cody 's lungs and restore his breathing . Have you done this before ? Um ... This procedure is performed quite often with neonates . We feel strongly it 's the best chance we have at saving your son 's life . Okay . Go ahead . Maggie , I 'm gon na be out of pocket for a little bit . For how long ? Uh , three or four hours . If anybody needs me , just redirect them to Dr. Kwon . Okay ? Okay , so I 'm going up there to check it out . Come on , Daniel , let the proper authorities handle it . The proper authorities , they 're just not that interested right now . I have a limited window . Stop . Look , I know you 're trying to protect Dr. Reese , but no matter what you find , you are really putting your relationship with her at risk . Sharon , if there 's even a remote chance that any of this stuff is true ... And , trust me , I do n't want it to be ... It 's a risk I 'm willing to take . Hear you might have found a solution . Fingers crossed . Looks like it 's all coming up roses for you today . You two , join me . Yes , sir . I mean , I 'm still hoping it 's me who gets to do the surgery . I 'll let Dr. Frisch know that we 're readyto run another simulation . Okay . Dr. Rhodes , Dr. Bekker , they need you back in the ICU . What 's going on ? Her BP just started plummeting . Bag her . What 's going on with my daughter ? Uh , ma'am ... She 's hemorrhaging . Uh ... all right . All right , hang 2 units ofO-neg on a pressure bag . Give me the ultrasound . We need to check her fetus and take a look at her placenta . Placenta 's marginally separating , causing her to bleed . Fetal heart tones are strong . We 'll reverse the blood thinners . Hopefully , the placenta will tamponade itself . If we reverse the thinners , her new valve could clot off . We 'll lose mom and baby . We have to get her to the O.R.Look , we can still save this pregnancy . It 's too late for that . Stop the heparin drip . Bolus a gram of TXA . We 're not gon na lose either of them . He still has n't woken up . No . How well do you know Jeremy ? Not that well . I mean , just from around . I had no idea he was using heroin . I do n't think that 's what Jeremy OD 'd on . No ? No . Pretty sure it was Percocet , which , coincidentally , is the same drug that went missing from the dispensary last week . So ? What , are you suggesting that I took them ? Did you ? You know how easy it is to score pharmaceuticals on the street ? Jeremy could 've gotten them from anyone . But he was at the party with you . Ethan , I swear , I did n't take those drugs . That 's not true . Yeah , all my life it 's been like this . You know , I 've had it . Emily ... No , I 'm not working some placethat thinks I 'm a criminal . Em ... Emily ... Happy ? You got him all to yourself now . How 's she doing ? She 's passing an old clot , but there 's no more active bleeding . Placenta looks like it tamponaded itself . Fetal heart tones are steady . We 've got a problem . Pressure 's down . Heart rate 's spiking . She 's clotting off that valve . We need to get her to the O.R . and replace the valve . Let 's go , come on ! What 's happening ? Stop ! No pulse . She must be in V-fib . Let 's get a crash cart ! Come on . Come on , Tracy . Come on . Stay with us . Please save her ! Please ! Hold compressions . Come on . Clear ! Still no pulse . Charge again . Charge ! Clear ! Another milligram of epi . Connor ... she 's gone . Oh , God , no ! No , no , no ! No ... Time of death , 17:23 . If you want , I can help the mother with the paperwork . No . This is my responsibility . Ms. Barker , I am so sorry for your loss . You talked my daughter into this , and now she 's gone forever . You did this . This is all your fault ! It 's all your fault ! Dr. Manning ... Cody 's temp 's back up to 103.7 . What are his sats ? 83%. 83 ? He 's getting worse . Okay . Hey , how 's he doing ? PLV 's not working . I made a huge mistake , Will . Natalie ... You were right . What ? Cody tested positive for mastocytosis . If you had put Cody on ECMO , he could 've gone into anaphylactic shock . You may have just saved his life . No , I have n't ... not yet . Guess things got out of hand last night . Yeah , you 're lucky Emily called us . According to your blood work , you had a high concentration of opioids in your system , along with toxic levels of acetaminophen . Most likely due to the Percocet . Yeah . So where 'd you get those pills ? Do you have a prescription ? No ... I mean ... my dad does . He had back surgery a few weeks ago . I swept some from his medicine cabinet . I feel like an idiot . Get some rest . We 'll check on you soon . You think he 's telling the truth ? No reason to doubt him . Have Noah work up Jeremy 's discharge . I need to find Emily , make things right . Dr. Manning ? Yes ? Cody 's sats are back above 90 . Looks like he 's out of the woods . Thank you for saving my boy . Of course . I just found out myself . Neurology 's in there now , doing a quick exam . You know what , we did good today . Yeah , we did , did n't we ? I mean , together . Dr. Rhodes , good . We 're just about to get started . You coming ? Dr. Latham , with your permission , I would like to remove myself from the team . Why ? I think it would be best for the patients and for everyone involved . A surgery with this level of difficulty and in that environment ... I do n't know that I can trust my judgment . Are you sure about this ? Yes . Mm . Very well . So , your dad had back surgery ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . According to your tox screen , the Percocet you took were hospital grade . That means they did n't come from your dad 's medicine cabinet . Possessing a Schedule Two narcotic with that level of potency is a felony offense . Now , I 'm not gon na report you , but I need you to tell me . Emily . She sold them to me . Emily ? Em ? What 's up ? You want a rematch ? I was just wondering , are you still holding onto Mom 's wedding ring ? Yeah , of course . Why would n't I ? Oh ... Just trying not to be a knucklehead . Okay , uh , well , come on in , and I 'll go get it 
@@5248441 My name is Oliver Queen . After 6 years of being a vigilante , the only way to achieve my goal and save my city was to confess to being The Green Arrow . Now my family and friends must carry on my mission without me . I am no longer a hero . Now I am inmate 4587 . Previously on " Arrow " ... Where 'd you get that ? Felicity gave it to me . I opened it up , and I found this . They 're GPS coordinates for this island . I know exactly where this is . Grab your stuff . We 're going back . Back where ? To star city . The silencer 's the only lead we have on Diaz . We ca n't let her escape . Is n't this kind of what we 've been doing the whole time , stepping in when the system fails ? Is n't that sort of the vigilante M.O. ? Sometimes , you have to cross the line for that . Listen . Nobody believes in that more than me . I 'm just not sure that 's what this is . The demon is on level two . Let 's go , 4587 . You 're going downstairs . I am Dr. Jarrett Parker , chief psychiatrist on level two . Keeping me in here without food or water . I understand these conditions may cause some discomfort , but your recent behavior indicates that you are a danger to other inmates and yourself . Until I can determine you are in the right mental state to be with the other inmates , it will be just the two of us for a while . I 'm here to conduct your psychiatric evaluation . But I 'm not crazy . That 's what I aim to determine . Now let 's begin . What is your name ? You know my name . Please answer the question . My name is Oliver Queen. == https : subscene.com ==I do n't belong here . I 'm hearing someone who does n't want to take responsibility for his actions . The choices that led you to slabside are of your own design . Somebody on this level has a connection to him . I need to find this person . The only reason that I am here is because I put myself here . Do you understand ? For the sake of argument , what will you do after you find this person ? I will use them to stop Diaz . How ? By hurting or killing him and then Mr. Diaz ? Recidivism is the likelihood that a violent criminal offender will commit another violent crime when set free . That is what I 'm trying to prevent , but I believe everyone here has a chance at redemption , even people like you . I do n't need your help , and I do n't need redemption . You do n't ? No . How many people have you hurt besides the prisoners and guards you sent to the infirmary ? I do n't know . How many people have you murdered ? Hmm ? Would you say you have violent tendencies ? I would say I 'm trying to protect my family . Where is Diaz ? No food or water , heat on blast . Call this an interrogation ? It can only get worse for you . You do n't have the stomach to do what you need to do . Diaz is only getting stronger . You have no idea what 's coming . Hey . Any luck ? No . Actually think she might be enjoying herself . We 're gon na need to turn up the heat . Any hotter , she 'll turn into soup . I meant turn up the stakes , do whatever it takes to make her give us the information . You do n't mean torture ? I do n't not mean it . Felicity , you do n't know what you 're saying . Torturing someone is a line you do not want to cross . That 's evil for evil . I 'm sorry about that . I am . Church broke you . You gave up Oliver 's identity , Rene . It worked . She tried to killDinah and Laurel and us . Diaz hired her . He 's not gon na stop coming after us until we are all dead . Oh , shoot . I was supposed to meet with Dinah5 minutes ago for a town hall . She is not going anywhere , so we 're gon na take a break , and we 're gon na figure this out later . Ok . Star city 's seen better days . God , this place . I swore I 'd never set foot here ever again . Yeah . Me , too . Sounds like I 'm not the only one with bad memories . The coordinates have changed since lian yu . Something must have triggered it . Felicity . She must know we 're here . Well , let 's see where she wants you to go . Sorry . Do n't you want to know what 's going on in your community ? I need to know what 's going on for my algebra quiz tomorrow . Oh . The rich part of star city gets 5 squad cars for every one that the glades get . Ma'am , I assure you that 's not the case . When my store got robbed , it took SCPD two hours to get there . You know who showed up only minutes later ? That new Green Arrow . Where were you ? I apologize for that response time . We are doing the best we can with limited resources . You and mayor pollard are in way over your heads . Ok , guys . Look . Captain Drake is here . She 's trying to help . Let 's all be reasonable . Well , facts are , Rene , things were better off with the vigilantes . Huh ? Yeah ? Come on . All set . Fire . Fire ! Fire ! Everybody stay calm , make your way to the exit . Hey . I got to get Zoe . This way . Hey . She 's over here . She 's right here . Sweetheart , are you ok , huh ? I 'm ok . The Green Arrow saved me . It 's all right . Although the origin of the glades youth center fire has yet to be determined , the SCPD has a leading suspect . The new Green Arrow was spotted at the scene of the crime . We believe he may be involved . Now I 've instructed captain Drake and the SCPD to utilize every resource to find and apprehend him . Vigilantism will not be tolerated . What a load of crap . The guy 's a hero . He saved her life . How 's she doing ? Doc Schwartz says she 'll be fine . They 're just holding her as a precaution . She 's a fighter just like her not-so-old man . I got her a little something . Hey , man . Is n't she too old for that ? Do not hate on beebo . Hey . Let 's let her rest . So if it was n't the new greenArrow that started that fire , then who was it ? Maybe it 's a homicidal maniac running around town with a shiny , new flamethrower , goes by dragon , hates our guts . It was n't Diaz . How do you know ? Because the perps used an accelerant that 's also been used in a rash of other fires around the glades , one on the same nightDiaz broke into the CDC . That gives him an alibi . This is A.R.G.U.S.We have to go . Keep us posted . How 's Zoe ? She 'll be ok . Good . The guy who did this wo n't be , not when I get my hands on him . Yeah . We 'll find him and that vigilante . I 've got patrols combing the city . We both know that new Green Arrow 's not who you should be looking for . She cares about locking up the new Green Arrow because it will make her look good . He saved Zoe 's life . Does n't definitively make him innocent . What was he doing there in the first place ? I 'm sure he has a good reason . Look . Let me help you by finding the guy who really did this . Rene , I already have one vigilante to deal with . I do not need two . I 'm not talking about wild dog . That 's my kid there , d . I became a vigilante for her because I wanted her to be able to walk the streets and not get attacked , not have her purse stolen , and not be offered drugs because her mother died in these streets already . I just want a better life for her . Look . I care about Zoe , too , and I promise I will find out who set that fire , but you saw what happened at that town hall , Rene . All I 'm asking is that you have faith in me . Ok ? Yeah . I got it . Good morning . Good morning ! I see you 've found a way to keep track of time . I 'm impressed . An active mind means you 're thinking about things . What is your name ? I 'm not answering any more of your questions . Still resistant . Hmm . I suppose we 'll have to try a different approach . Ugh ! Agh ! What wa ... what was that ? That will help make you more comfortable , allow us to have a real conversation . You do n't have to fight anymore . You 've fought enough in your life . You consider yourself a hero . Are you on the Queen 's gambit ? No . We 're on a life raft . Gambit 's already gone down . Was there anyone else there with you and your father ? Yes . His ... his bodyguard ha-hackett . We ... there were the 3 of us who survived . Ohh ! Dad ? Survive . Nooo ! What ? What did you see ? I see my father asking me to right his wrongs ... Right before he shot himself in the head . He sacrificed his life for mine . Is that why you became a vigilante ? Yes . Because he put his sins on you ? Would you please stop ? A father passes on more than just his name to his children . He provides them their legacy . What became of hackett ? There was only enough food and water for one person . My dad shot him . Your father was n't a hero . Mr. Queen , he was a murderer . He saved me . He condemned you . He is gone , but here you are caught in the same vicious cycle , paying for his crimes . How 'd you get past my SCPD detail ? You know I went to mit , right ? It 's like Harvard for computer geeks with an acceptance rate of 6.7% , so if I can get in there , I can get in pretty much anywhere except for here , which is why I had to resort to saying that ... We were sorority sisters . Wow . So you are actually practicing law . Why does everybody find that so hard to believe ? Well , probably because you 're not the real Laurel or a real lawyer . Ooh . Try saying that 3 times fast . What a tongue twister . Ok . Listen . You 're still here . I have a case that you might be interested in . Your Laurel might have done the whole pro bono thing , but this Laurel does n't . Hypothetically , if there was a female assassin who went by , I do n't know , the name the silencer , who had ... for purposes of this illustration ... Only attacked the d.A . With a belt device that canceled sound , well , if someone has captured said assailant and was holding her hostage , do you think the d.A . In this perfectly random hypothetical might be interested in serving justice ? You kidnapped and imprisoned the silencer ? No . No , not me . Just asking for a friend . And you want my help . Yeah . I never thought this day would come either , but here we are . You are a hell of a lot more interesting than I thought . Where is she ? Hey . Should n't you be out looking for the bad guys who started the fire ? Hey , hey , hey . I 'm your pops . I 'm right where I need to be . Besides , your aunt Dinah does n't want me doing that . There 's a fire at the lofts . Dad , you got to go . You taught me only punks forget about their community . Why you always got to listen to everything I say ? Hey , hey . I 'm on your side , remember ? He got away . Who got away ? Jon Cortez . Is he the one who 's been setting these fires ? Freeze ! Put your weapon on the ground . Raise your hands above your head slowly . D.I got a call about a suspicious fire . I had a hunch you might be involved . He 's just trying to help . Then he can prove that by turning himself in ! Step aside , Rene . , but I just could n't let you arrest him . Turn around . What ? Turn around ! Are you kidding me ? I warned you the last time . I asked you to trust me . Instead , you just actively tampered with my investigation , so now I have no choice . Are you serious ? Rene Ramirez , you are under arrest . You have the right to remain silent . Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law , so I suggest you shut the hell up . Let 's go . Unh ! Ugh ! Good morning . Please state your name . Oliver Queen . You were just now meditating . Yeah . Where did you learn to do that ? Hong Kong . Who taught you ? Tatsu yamashiro . When we last spoke , you mentioned your father killed a man ... hackett ... So you could live . That 's right . I feel like my father had to ... make an impossible choice . Parker , please leave my son out of this , please . At times , love can blind a person to the harm they 're inflicting on their families , the cycle of violence they 're creating that they have learned from their own parents . I would never intentionally harm my son . Did you know that children of the incarcerated are 3 times more likely to enter the justice system than children of non-offenders ? William is nothing like me . That may be true , but what effect do you think you 're having on William ? I think he 's alive . Alive but with no father , his mother dead , and no home ? Does that sound like a good life ? No , it does n't . Everything that I 've doneI 've ... I 've done for my son . Is n't any part of you concerned that William will take your lead and become a murderer just like you ? Then listen to me . That promise to your father was made when you were vulnerable and desperate . It tainted your mission from the start , infecting you and now your son . It was n't fair of your father to ask what he did of you . You must let go of the past . Only then can you spare your family from paying for your sins . Go to hell . He 's not responding . Prepare the machine . Tell me exactly what she said . Besides telling me to go frak myself , nothing . Well , lucky for you , I 've been working on my cross examination . Your witness . Hello . Remember me ? What 's the matter ? Cat got your tongue ? You have no idea who I am , what I survived . You 're in way over your head . I do n't think I am ... You think you 're being loyal . The only loyalty he knows is to himself . He 'll kill you without a second thought . I 'd do the same thing to anyone who got in my way . I do n't think you 're hearing me . Maybe I need to talk a little bit louder . Hey . Hey . Got a call ... From Rene . Oh . Of course he called you . Why ? To talk some sense into me ? I just came by to find out why you locked him up . Because he broke the law again , and I ca n't keep making exceptions just because he 's our friend , John . Sometimes , it 's hard being on the other side of this . Enforcing the rules . Yeah . That 's been a tough transition for me , too . Look . I know Rene believes he 's doing the right thing here , but our circumstances have changed . Dinah , you 're under pressure , a lot of pressure . I get that , but you sure it 's not something more ? Hey . You know what helps me ? Spending time with J.J.Family , Dinah . That helps us through . John , living in the shadows is when all the worst things happen . Oliver going to prison , Vince ... first undercover , and then ... That 's the real reason , because as much as I believed in team Arrow , I had to move on . I had to be a different kind of hero for this city . Yeah . You know , sometimes , I wonder if there 's any form of justice that 's 100% on the level , even at A.R.G.U.S.I think sometimes you need vigilantes and law enforcement working together to get results . Quentin Lance ... He did things by the book , but , Dinah , Lance was willing to work with anyone who could help him . But a stranger with good intel . Rene asked me to look into Jon Cortez , a merc arsonist with his own crew for hire . What you do next with that information is up to you . So this was Smoak tech ? Must have been something in its heyday . This was Felicity 's office . You know , it makes sense that she would lead us here , but would n't it just be easier for her to reach out to me ? Why is she playing games ? I have no idea . I mean , ironically , she was the one who influenced me to go into the tech field , even after everything that happened . Well , you 're a lot more forgiving than me . Looks like a system Felicity showed me when I was a kid . Back then , it was just a set of designs . Can you fix it ? It 's an extremely outdated model , so yes . Just a simple recursive algorithm followed by a littleFelicity special . Freeze ! I ... I was supposed to meet an investor , and , um , obviously , I got the wrong address . You 're such a bad liar . Shut up . Please do n't kill us ! I 'm not gon na hurt you . You should n't have come back here , Roy . I knew Dig was the right choice for that phone call , and Felicity did n't answer . John 's not bailing you out . Listen . I ca n't have you out there trying to catch those arsonists on your own . You do n't like that , you can stay locked up in here , but your intel ... It was good , so help me catch them by working with me . I ... I 'm sorr ... I ... I 'm sorry . Just , ears are a little clogged . It just sounded like you wanted to team up . Exactly . Look . Right now , the SCPD on its own , we just ... we ca n't get justice for the glades , so I am willing to give working together a shot if you do it my way . " If " ? I 've been trying to make this happen for weeks . All right . A.R.G.U.S.Found somethingI do n't have jurisdiction to get to ... bank records . Jon Cortez has been receiving regular payments from patbane holdings . So let me guess . Patbane holdings is n't on the up and up . It 's a shell company , one that 's been buying these torched-up properties at highly reduced rates . So somebody 's been burning down the glades and then buying it back up ? So who 's at the top of the patbane food chain ? That 's what we need to find out . Ok . Time to bail you out . You scared the crap out of me . You find out where Diaz is ? No . She 's not being very chatty . I tried , and if I keep trying , I 'm gon na kill her . Since when did you care about anybody 's life ? I do n't , but if she 's dead , she ca n't talk , and then we have nothing . Which is what we have now . We need that information . And you 're gon na get it with a rusty screwdriver ? If Diaz taught me anything , it 's Patience . He waited 30 years to get revenge on one person . We do n't have 30 years . This is n't you . This is the new me . This is the me who does n't wait around to get murdered . This is the me ... This is the me that fights back . I respect that . In fact , I can actually stand being around this new you . It 's just once you do this , it 's ... Hey . I used to be just like you . Well , that I find hard to believe . On my earth , I loved my father and my Ollie , but they were taken away from me because they were murdered . It 's when you lose the people who matter most . Once you get through the grief , you get angry , you want revenge , and I took it , but the darkness , it swallows you the more you feed it , and digging yourself back out to the light , it 's ... It 's really hard . In fact , I wish someone would have warned me before I got blood all over my hands the first time . Maybe that way , I would have been more like your Laurel . I do n't know what else to do . We need to play the long-term game here . I need you to use that big brain of yours and think . I do n't understand . You were police captain . What happened ? That was a long time ago . Yeah . There were police everywhere , and you just dragged us through the sewer to get here . What the hell happened to star city ? Star city fell when the glades Rose . They built a wall . They closed their borders . No one outside the glades is allowed to enter . The SCPD are basically hired guns . They protect the glades from what 's outside their wall . I think maybe we should have stayed on lian yu . But then we would n't have gotten this . What is this thing ? It 's a new form of electrical therapy that targets areas of memory in the brain , the places where our greatest fears are held . I 've used it to help reform slabside 's more stubborn cases . I do n't need to be reformed . Are you on the raft ? Yes . What is your father asking you ? He 's asking me to right his wrongs . And setting you on a road to ruin that will one day poison your son . Dad ... I 'm scared . Come here . I 'm gon na take care of everything , all right ? You 're gon na be fine . Those last moments on the raft , your father asked you to redeem his own life , but if you had been in his place , what would you have told your son ? We 're gon na die here . You 're gon na make it through this . You 're gon na get off this raft , and you , William , you are ... Are gon na have an amazing life ... Because you 're destined for great things , not to die on this raft . William , I love you . Live . You were talking just now . You told your son you loved him . Why ? Because he 's the most important thing in the world to me . Then it is up to you to end your father 's cycle for the good of your son . Only you can do it . Do you see that now ? There . Guys in cyber untangled the patbane holdings web . This is our guy ... Marcus fish , a real estate investor here in star city . He managed to buy up real estate on every glades block where a fire happened . Ca n't be a coincidence . Cortez has been getting paid in two installments ... Half up front , half the day after the job . There 's an odd number of payments . Patbane made a deposit earlier today but no second payment . That means the next attack is happening tonight . You know , I heard somebody was trying to buy the starling palladium , old movie house over on 8th . And that 's just a few blocks from here . I 've made a vow not to kill , but it seems I must . Aah ! Ohh ! We got company . Hey , dummy . Hands up . Watch out ! Thanks for the save . Where are the other two ? Guessing over there . Freeze ! Nice shot . Back to work . I 'll take care of her . Drop it now ! You ok , d. ? Yeah . You got the others ? Yeah , we stopped them . How do we stop this ? The sprinklers are jammed . There 's nothing to keep this from spreading . Help me get him . D. ! You guys better clear out before the cops arrive . Whoa ! Stand down , stand down ! I 'm a friendly . You 're not , uh , here to arrest me again , are you ? Uh , no , not today . Feels good to be fighting side by side again . Aunt Dinah , what are you doing here ? Hey . So sorry , kiddo . I did n't mean to wake you up . Just checking to make sure you 're ok . Brought you a little something . This is so cool . Is it a bird ? Yeah . It 's a canary . Here . Let me help you . Good evening . Now that you 've had time to think things over , have you come to any conclusions ? Yes . That 's good to hear . State your name . My name is inmate 4587 . Where 's Diaz ? If your friend is n't getting it out of me , you definitely are n't . Diaz took everything from me ... My husband , my family , my life . I do n't have anything to lose ! Felicity ! I 'm getting that information . Upstairs ! What the hell is wrong with you ? You told me to use my brain . She 's gone . How 'd you know she was gon na take the belt ? Lucky guess . The RFID chipI installed in it is gon na lead us straight to Diaz . Wow . What ? You 're different . You remind me of theFelicity from my earth . We know each other on earth two ? Everybody knows you . You run your own empire . This girl ? Yep . Except for she 's ruthless . Are you prepared to be ruthless ? Because once the silencer leads us to Diaz , we wo n't just be torturing him . We 're gon na have to kill him . Can you handle that ? This is a waste of time . How much longer are we gon na be trapped in here ? You used to be a lot more patient . Should n't be too much longer . Felicity told me that making a pattern on a rubik 's cube is like running an algorithm . Still , no answers . Wait . What ? What just happened ? Is that some sort of map ? It 's the glades . You two remember Zoe . Hi , Roy , William . Wh ... what are you doing here ? I 'm with the vigilante resistance , one of the few left fighting to save star city . Is your dad here , too ? My dad would n't be caught dead in star city . This map shows secret routes in and out of the glades . Where did you get this ? Felicity . She 's the one who sent us to star city . No . That 's impossible . William , I 'm so sorry to be the one to tell you this , but Felicity Smoak is dead. == https : subscene.com

Are you gon na die on us ? Boop . We all die , my strange little child friend . It 's just a matter of how ... and when . They 're gon na be looking for us up there , so I need you to tell me where you parked your car . Yes , you can have as much food as you want , but only if you tell me where your car is parked . Uh-oh . Uh-oh ? The car 's off the board . What ? They took the keys . The Russians , they took the keys . Like , forever ago . That 's a bummer , right ? Oh ! Oh , my God , that tastes so good .

The appropriate question is " When the hell are they ? " You see , Einstein has just becomethe world 's first time traveler ! Sorry . Sorry . I sent him ... into the future ! Okay , it 's official . I 'm never having kids . Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death . A week later . The point is , his plan did n't work . Only because it was a setup . What ? He was just a patsy . Tell me you 're joking . Shh ! Shh ! We need to get outta here . All right , you watchTweedledee and Tweedledum . Make sure they do n't go anywhere . Where are you going ? To find us a ride . Look out ! Doc ... What 's happening ? I have no idea . Are you telling me that you built a time machine ... What 's he saying ? He 's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine . Sorry , " keys . " Two keys . Two-man rule . Two-man rule ? Yeah , two men , two keys , like a ... nuclear launch . But , uh , to retrieve the keys , there is a vault . And to open the vault , you need to enter Planck 's constant . All right , so we get the keys , and then we turn the machine off . That 's what he says . All right , well , that should n't be too hard . We can do this . Joyce , did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress ? Yeah , but there has to be a way in . Yeah , there is . Our military . Who are coming . Well , we do n't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference , and then you hung up on them , so we do n't know what the hell 's going on , because now we 're ... Wait , wait , what are we do ... Oh ! Wait , that 's right ! We 're on our way to rescue our children from the big , badFourth of July celebration ! You know what , if you ca n't handle this , then just turn around and drop me off first . Children ! Children ! Children ! This interminable bickering was amusing at first , but it 's getting very stale and we 've still got a long drive ahead of us . So , why do n't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another ? Whoa ! You are way off base , buddy ! Oh , spare me , spare me , spare me ! Yes , yes , he 's a brute . I know . Probably reminds you of a bad relationship , and , gosh , you 'd really like a nice man to settle down with , but , admit it , you 're real curious to know what he 's like in the sack . And you . Ha ! Well , you 're just a big manbaby who 'd rather act tough than show his true feelings , because the last time you opened your heart , you got hurt . Owie . So , please , for my sake , either quit your bickering , or pull over , tear off those clothes , and get it over with already ! What was that ? I told them they should have sex . They have not had sex ? No . Oh ! Oh ! Okay , get her down . Okay . Lemme see . Oh , shit . What ... What ... Hey , what are you doing ? I 'm cleaning the wound .

All I know is ... we need El . Bowl ... Bowl ... Bowl ... Why would n't it be with the cereal ? I do n't know . What else do you use a bowl for ? I ... I do n't know . Oh , shit . Satan 's Baby . You ever shot one of these suckers ? No . Is it sweet ? That 's an understatement . That does n't look like a bowl . Nah , it 's way better . AKA gunpowder .

You 'll look even more badass . Bitchin ' . Yeah , bitchin ' . El ... Yeah ? I 've been meaning to tell you something . It 's just , being broken up , it 's been hard . And ... I like that you and Max are friends now . It 's just , I was jealous at first , and ... and angry . And that 's why I said all that stupid stuff . And it 's like I wanted you all to myself ... I 'm sorry . I just , like , I 've never felt like this , you know , with anyone before ... and ... You know , they do say it makes you crazy . What makes you crazy ? You never ... You never heard that term ... You know , like the phrase , like ... " blank makes you crazy , " like the word ... " Girlfriends " ? No , no , no , no , not ... not girlfriends . " Boyfriends . " No ! No , no , not boyfriends either . It 's like ... It 's like a feeling or ... A feeling ... Yeah , like something ... Like , old people say it to each other sometimes . Old people ? Yeah . What I wan na say is ... that I just ... I know that I ... I repeat ... this is a code red ! Dustin ? Mike ? Dustin ! Mike ! Oh , my God , you have to listen . I mean , I actually was mad , but it 's also becauseI was trapped underground in a secret Russian base . Dustin , you 're going way too fast . I ca n't understand you . I know that sounds insane , but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins ! The goddamn Russians ! And now ... they 're using ... to open the gate . Dustin , you 're ... you 're breaking up . And now they 're after us and we do n't have a way out of here , so I need you to come and get us . Can Nancy drive ? Dustin , you 're cutting out . Mike ? Dustin , you there ? Mike ? Mike , do you copy ? Dustin ... Shit ! Not now . Please , not now . Mike ! Dustin ! Mike ! What is it ? Do you have any batteries ? Double-A ? Why would I have batteries ? I always carry batteries . Then what 's the problem ? I need eight . Eight ? Shit ... are they ? That 's amazing . So , like , I was n't totally focused in there or anything , but ... I 'm pretty sure ... that mom was trying to bang her son . Wait , wait , the hot chick was Alex P. Keaton 's mom ? Yeah , I 'm pretty sure . But they 're the same age . No , but he went back in time . Then why is it called Back to the Future ? He has to go back to the future because he 's in the past . So , the future is actually the present , which is his time . Wh ... What ? No , no , it 's my turn . You 've had enough . Wow . Hey , Robin . You got ta check this out . Check this ... This ... The ceiling , it 's beautiful . Oh , wow . Oh . Stay here , go over the plans with Smirnoff . I can help look . No , you 'll scare the children . You hear me ? Stay put ! You know , say what you will about Kline , he certainly knows how to throw a party . I 'm sorry about him , by the way . Who , Larry ? No , Murray . He 's a sick individual who likes to get under people 's skin . So , let 's not let him , you know , get under our skin . I 'm not , I have n't . I just , you seem a little more quiet than usual . I just ... I just wan na find the kids . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'll give it my best shot . You won yourself a bear ! Thank you . Here you go . Mayor Kline ! One more , one more . Big smile . There we go . Watch it ! Happy Fourth , dick . Come on , come on , come on ! Pick up , pick up , pick up , you commie bastards ! Quiet . Oh , sorry . The original is a classic , no question about it . But the remake ... Sweeter , bolder ... better . You 're insane . So , you prefer the original Thing ? What ? No , I 'm not talking about The Thing , I 'm talking about New Coke . It 's the same concept , dude . Uh , actually , it 's not the same concept . It is the same concept . No , it 's not . Yes , it is . Hey . Sorry . Sorry . Did you ... find him ? The movies ? Dustin 's so freaked out about the gate , he decides to go watch a movie ? Yeah , makes total sense . You 're positive he said " gate " and not " great " ? Yeah , like , " This movie I 'm watching is great . " Sounded like " gate . " Which would explain how the Mind Flayer 's still alive . Yeah , we just have to shut it again . Keep mocking my plan , Max . Keep mocking it . I wan na hear you say it again , because you keep doubting me . You keep doubting me ! Ridiculous . Will ? We 're gon na prove ' em wrong , right ? The ceiling stopped spinning for me . Is it still spinning for you ? Holy shit . No . You think we puked it all up ? Maybe . Ask me something . Interrogate me . Okay . Interrogate you . Sure . Um ... When was the last time you , uh , peed your pants ? Today . What ? When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw . Oh , my God . It was just a little bit , though . Yeah , it 's definitely still in her system . Oh ... All right , my turn . Okay . Hit me . Have you ... ever been in love ? Yep . Nancy Wheeler . First semester , senior year . Oh , my God . She 's such a priss . Why not ? I think it 's because I found someone who 's a little bit better for me . It 's crazy . Ever since Dustin got home , he 's been saying , " You know , you got ta find your Suzie . You got ta find your Suzie . " Wait , who 's Suzie ? It 's some girl from camp , I guess his girlfriend . To be honest with you , I 'm not 100% sure she 's even real . But that 's not ... that 's not really the point . That does n't matter . The point is , this girl , you know , the one that I like , it 's somebody that I ... did n't even talk to in school . And I do n't even know why . Maybe ' cause Tommy H. would 've made fun of me or ... I would n't be ... prom king . It 's stupid . First of all , she 's hilarious . She 's so funny . I feel like , this summer , I have laughed harder than I have laughed ... in a really long time . And she 's smart . Way smarter than me . You know , she can crack , like , top secret Russian codes and ... You know ? She 's honestly unlike anyoneI 've ever even met before . Robin ? Robin , did you just OD in there ? No . I ... am still alive . The floor 's disgusting . Yeah , well , I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt , so ... What do you think ? About ? This girl . She sounds awesome . She is awesome . And what about the guy ? I think he 's on drugs , and he 's not thinking straight . Really ? ' Cause I think he 's thinking a lot more clearly than usual . He 's not . Look ..... like really know her , I do n't think he 'd even want to be her friend . No , that 's not true . No way is that true . Listen to me , Steve . It 's shocked me to my core , but I like you . I really like you . But I 'm not like your other friends . And I 'm not like Nancy Wheeler . Robin , that 's exactly why I like you . Do you remember what I said about Click 's class ? About me being jealous and , like , obsessed ? Yeah . It is n't because I had a crush on you . It 's because ... she would n't stop staring at you . Mrs. Click ? Tammy Thompson . I wanted her to look at me . But ... she could n't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair . And I did n't understand , because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor . And you asked dumb questions ... I would go home ... and just scream into my pillow . But Tammy Thompson 's a girl . Steve . Yeah ? Oh . Oh . Holy shit . Yeah . Holy shit . Steve ... did you OD over there ? No , I just , uh ... just thinking . Okay . I mean , yeah . Tammy Thompson , you know , she 's cute and all , but ... I mean , she 's a total dud . She is not . Yes , she is . She wants to be , like , a singer . She wants to move to , like , Nashville and shit . She has dreams . She ca n't even hold a tune . She 's practically tone-deaf . Have you heard her ? All the time.  You see me now tonight  Shut up.  You see me ...  She does not sound like that . She sounds exactly ... That 's a great impersonation of her . She does not . She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.  And if you could hold me tight   We 'll be holding on forever  Exactly . I know ! Okay . What the hell ? And why all this ? If I just turn the keys , it 's like turning off a car . But then the car still works , does it not ? Yes . And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode ? I want the car to explode . Good . Then do this . Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does . It is not pretty . Turns people into dust . And then ... It 's over . And I become an American citizen and join in the fun , yes ? Who said you had to be an American to join the fun ? It does n't get more American than this , my friend . Fatty foods , ugly decadence , rigged games ... Fifteen tickets , please . That 's just it , my dear Alexei . They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness ! But it 's all a scam , a trick , to put your money in the rich man 's pocket . That , my dear friend , is ... America . But , hey ... knock yourself out . Where are you going ? To get us the closest thing to foodI can find . Hey . Hey . Karen . Step right up ! ... feel the wind push you back and it 's gon na ... Hold on . Do we have seat belts ? Hey , Karen . Joyce !

@@5260141 Yep , that 's me . Kronk . Wait . Where did I go ? Right , there I am . Covered in cheese like a human pizza . My life was fine until today . - But now I 'm doomed . Doomed ! - Ah ! You know , it was n't always like this . I helped save the emperor 's life . Found a rewarding career . Next slide ! I even made some great new friends . Oh ! But look at me now ! Hiding out like a frightened kid who needs a hug from his teddy bear . The little yellow one with the button nose . Ah , if only I could turn back the clock . Back to a time when I had a spring in my step and a ... smile in my heart . A time I like to think of as earlier that same day . Ahhh ! Mmm ! Mmm ! Come on ! Mm-hmm . That 's what I 'm talking about . Look out ! Here it comes ! Emperor Kuzco here , coming at you live from the palace . Hail Kuzco ! No , please , do n't grovel . I 'd feel stupid . I 'm not that kind of guy anymore . I 'm nice now . Did n't you see the first movie ? Yay ! A 50-foot me ! Oh , I love that movie , ' cause it 's all about me . But right now it 's Kronk 's turn to be in the limelight . Let me put this as simply as I can . This one 's his movie . Not my movie . His movie . Not mine . His , not mine . His . Not mine . You got it ? Even the little one's ? OK . I 'll be back to check on you later . Have some popcorn , a little sippy-sip of your sip stuff . Places , please . Action ! Ordering !

Pacha , you forgot your change yesterday . Hey , thanks , Kronk ! Well , what 's right is right . Otherwise ... - It 'd be wrong ! - Right . Boy , the place is packed . Yeah . Never had this many friends when I was an evil henchman . And look at you now , chef at Mudka 's . And head delivery boy ! Delivery Boy logo by permission of Delivery Boy Local 8675309 . - I get my one-year pin next week . - That calls for a celebration ! A toast to Kronk ! Llamagram . Thank you . Everything OK , buddy ? Oh ! Are you kidding ? It 's just your run-of-the-mill urgent llamagram . What am I gon na do ? What am I gon na do ? I know . I 'll tunnel out of here with a spoon , escape through the sewers and live as a quiet but lonely shepherdess named Maria . That 'll work . We 're out of spoons ! That 's it . I 'm done for . Chin up , big guy . I 'm here for you . You ! This is all your fault ! You ... You 're the one who got me into this mess ! If you 'd listened , you could have had everything . But no . You had to listen to Miss Goody Two-Wings . Mr . Goody Two-Wings . Yeah , big talk coming from a guy in a dress . - I told you , it 's a robe . - And those are pearls . Fellas ! You 're not helping . He 's ... He 's ... " Ca n't wait to meet your wife and kids and see your big house on the hill . Cordially , your father , Papi . " So ? So Papi said I have to have all those things if I 'm ever gon na be a success . And I once had them , but I lost them ! - So ? - I never told him that part . Big whoop . Tell him the truth . What ? Tell him the truth ? Are you nuts ? You do n't let a guy like Papi down , or you 'll get one of these . The Cold Shoulder , the Frenzied Eyebrow , the Grimace of Doom , the Sneer of Despair , the Crippling Wince of Guilt , the Scowl of Impending Wrath , and worst of all , the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection . Total rejection . Right , right . Mm-hmm . I remember it well . Too well . He said if I did n't get serious , I 'd never amount to anything . But nothing I ever did was good enough for him . All I ever wanted was a thumbs up from Papi . And I was so close . I once had a beautiful house on a hill . Papi woulda loved it . That house was a dream come true . Are you gon na tell me your life story , or are we gon na get back to running a restaurant ? You 're right . Priorities . Get comfortable . I 've got a lot to get off my chest . Oy ! I had to ask . Oy ! I had to ask . My nightmare began on a day like any other . So , technically , I guess that would be a " daymare . " But I digress . It was lunchtime , and I was making my usual deliveries around town . A perfect example of how to grow old with grace and dignity . Does this look like a rash to you ? Has anybody seen my teeth ? Oy ! My aching knee . I sure wish there was some way to stop getting old . If only they could put youth in a bottle . I 'd pay anything for that . Again with the youth potion . - How many times do I have to - There 's no such thing ! - But if there were ... - But there 's not ! - I said " if " ! - If , schmiff ! OK , you two lovebirds . I do n't have any youth potion , but I did bring you lunch . - Hello , Kronk ! - Hello , Kronk ! - Hiya , Kronk ! - Rudy ! Gim me some stick . What 's shaking ? - What is n't ? - Brought your favorite : - Pur ? e of mystery meat . - Oooh ! Ahhh ! Drink up , everyone ! Liquid gold . Ugh ! How can you drink that stuff ? Kronk says it 's good for us . Good enough for me . Fill her up , Kronk ! - I guess that 's everything . - Are n't you forgetting something ? - No , that 's not it . - Here you go , pal . From all of us . Oh , no , Rudy . I could n't . We insist ! It 's for your house fund . You know . So you can afford that house on the hill your father always wanted you to have . Oh , yeah . And then I could finally get the big thumbs up from Papi . Yeah . How 's that going ? Oh , I 'll get there . Someday . How about fresh pill bug tomorrow ? - All right ! - I 'll see you all later . Oh , boy . Uh , somebody lose this ? Anybody ? That 's weird . Ooh ! Hey ! If only there 'd been some kind of warning . A sign . Anything . Oh , you 're a feisty one . Hold still now . Huh ? Hmm ... Ahh ! All right . Where 'd you go , you little rascal ? Looking for ... this ? Hello , Kronk . Yzma ! What are you doing here ? I live here . Ever since I was thrown out of the palace . Ah . Weird . Never seen you around . Ah , but I 've seen you , Kronk . - Oh . You look good . - You think ? At least you 're not a cat anymore . - Except for that . - Yes . An unfortunate side effect of our last escapade together . Yeah . Good times . You drank that potion , turned you into a cat . Who would have thought ? It was a pink one like this . Do n't touch the pink one ! It 's cough medicine . Hope you get to feeling better . And I have a proposition for you . A business proposition . Oh . Whoo ! You see , Kronk , I 'm not the person I once was . I 've changed . I 've turned myself around and devoted myself to hel " helping others . " Oh , well , that 's some turnaround . I want to help those old geez ... I mean , your friends out there . Would n't you do anything to ease their suffering , Kronk ? - Of course I would , Yzma . - Good . Then follow me ! Pull the lever ! Uh ... This lever ? - I worked out the bugs . - Just checking . Whoo ! Huh ? Wait for it . This is even better than your last one ! Whoo ! Welcome to my new secret lab . - Souvenir photo ? - Rats ! My eyes are closed . Follow me ! Whoa ! Looks like someone 's been busy . I 've finally done it . I 've created the elixir of life . - Regular and diet . - Huh . What do you call this ? Yzma 's Young and Beautiful ! Heh . Catchy . And now that you 're here , I finally have the one person who can make my plan a success ! And that person would be ? - You . - Me ! I knew that . Wait . Why me ? Because I 'm not exactly what you call a " people person . " And everyone trusts you . Those old people will buy anything you tell them to . So you want me to sell this to them ? What do you say , Kronk ? Help me to help you to help them ? I ca n't take money from them . It would n't be right . Oh , too bad . Now I guess you 'll never get that great big house on a hill and the big thumbs up from Papi . Papi ? Bingo . Whoa ! " You 'll achieve a beautiful connection with your father . " Yes ! Now , sell , sell , sell ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Step right up . It 's finally arrived . The cure for everything that ails you . Yzma 's Young and Beautiful ! Ugh . It 's a , uh , youth potion . Ohhh ! - Here you go . - Kronk ! Does this stuff really work ? Does this stuff really work ? Of course it does , you idiot ! Of course it does , you idiot ! Good enough for me ! Drink up , everyone ! Liquid gold . Oh . Look at my range of motion ! My elbow does n't creak ! I 'm melting away the pounds ! Hair ! I 've got hair ! Look out , old Yzma 's back ! Well , that worked . Suckers ! It 's like a dream come true . I put slime in a bottle , call it a youth potion and they ca n't get enough . Again ! Shut up ! Whoo ! Could she be crazier ? Cuckoo ! You see what 's going on here , do n't you , folks ? Here 's a hint . You got sewer slime , fancy packaging , crazy laugh like a demon from the bowels of the earth . It 's a scam ! Her potion 's a fake ! She 's selling snake oil , people ! Wake up ! Oh , you saw it already , huh ? Well , smarty , I bet you did n't see this ! Oh ! Yikes ! That 's gon na haunt me in my nightmares . Can we just move on , please ? Guy in the booth ! Now ! Big load of happy coming through . Does n't get better than this , does it ? I 'm making tons of cash for my house fund . Now if only I could find a house on a hill . Kronk , heard you were looking for a house on a hill . - You heard right . Good luck with that . How much ? Sold ! Look , everyone ! - I sold the house ! - Hooray ! OK . Take care . Bye-bye . Oh , yeah . It 's all coming together . Dear Papi , remember how you never thought I 'd amount to anything ? Well , I got news for you . Good news ! I finally got that big house on a hill you always wanted me to have . It 's really great . You 're gon na love it . It 's got all the amenities . Swimming pool , golf course ... The windmill 's a killer . And my favorite part of all ... Whoo ! Pancake Junction ! I even built a cozy little guest wing just for you . Yep . Just a big , serious house for a big , serious guy . Like me . That 's who I am . Marge , you getting all this ? - Tina . - Right . Sorry . I know you 're gon na be so proud of your little Kronker . - Mr . Kronk ? - Yes , Tina ? - Marge . - Right . Wait . What ? - A Mr . Rudy is here to see you . - Rudy ? Rudy who ? Hey , Kronk ! Oh , that Rudy . Long time no see ! Rudy ! What happened to you ? You 're , uh , not wearing any clothes . - Oh , that . I sold my clothes to buy more of Yzma 's youth potion . You sold your clothes ? I sold everything . We even sold the senior home . - You sold your home ? - Yeah . To you . Oh . Yeah . - We 're flat broke . - That 's awful . I know . I ca n't afford any more youth potion . Think you can do anything to help out an old friend ? Oh . How about if I spot you a bottle ? My precious ! Kronk just wants to keep it . Figure that out on your own , genius ? Yeah , sure did . - Figured what out ? - OK . Uh ... Take a look at your pal , Rudy . This is before . This is after . Before . After . You see any difference ? Hmm . Can I see " before " again ? Well , I give up . They look exactly the same . He looks exactly the same , so the potion is worthless , and Yzma 's a crook , and it 's all my fault because I helped her do it . What 's the problem ? Look at him . He 's happy . Eh , fine . You win . Oh , yeah . Rudy ? Yzma 's youth potion is a fake . - She cheated you . - Oh ? And ... I cheated you too . Oh ... I 'm sorry . I guess we better go tell the others . The others ! I almost forgot ! They 're about to elect Yzma emperor ! I 'd like to thank all the little people , but what do they matter ? What matters is me , me , me ! And when you elect me as your new emperor , I 'm going to be on top of the world ! - Stop this charade ! - Yzma 's youth potion is a fake ! - Stop this charade ! - Yzma 's youth potion is a fake ! Kronk ? What are you doing ? - I want you all to look at Rudy ... - Uh ! ... and tell me what you see . Whoo ! That is one hot hunk of man ! He 's in his golden years . Not getting any younger . Chronologically challenged . I got wrinkles , bunions , ear hair ! I 'm still old ! Hey , he 's right . I 'm still old too . Me too ! And Hildy looks like ... Uh-uh-uh . Do n't even ! Yzma 's a crook ! - Yzma 's a witch ! Come on , fellas ! Hit it , girls ! - Whoo-hoo ! - Yippee ! - There she is ! - She 's a liar ! - Get her ! - Stop her ! - Do n't let her get away ! - Shame on you ! Got you ! Back off , or I 'll jump ! Wait ! That ca n't be right . Whoo ! OK . Why do n't we all just take a step back ? Not you , Yzma . She stole everything we have ! Yeah , we did n't chase her all the way down here for nothing ! Nice moves back there , Hildy . Oh ! What about you ? Pouncing like a wildcat . Hey , I just realized something . We chased Yzma all the way down here . Did n't I just cover that ? Do n't you see ? We 're busting moves like a bunch of teenagers ! Ooh ! Wait . That ca n't be right . - Let 's get her ! - Stand back ! Do n't make me use this ! Ooh ! Your cough medicine ? No ! My most fiendishly diabolical potion ever ! When I drink this , you wo n't be able to lay a finger on me ! Get her ! - How cute ! - Cutie pie ! See ? I told you so . That 's weird . Let 's all reflect on these lessons on our way home tonight . Well , everyone , back to the alley . - You 're living in an alley ? - Well , sure . We sold our house to you . I got dibs on the cardboard box ! Come on ! You had the box last night . It 's my turn . This is awful . I 've got to find them a place to live . But where can I find a gigantic house with 30 extra bedrooms ? Where ? Think , think , think ! Your house ! Right ! Whoa , Nelly ! Let 's not overreact . You wan na lose your dream house ? That 's gon na get us the big thumbs up from Papi . If I lose the house , I 'll let Papi down . I ca n't let Papi down . But you tricked Rudy out of that house ! Oh , my ! It 's true ! I took away Rudy 's home ! Hey ! You got that house fair and square ! Yeah , but he cheated his best friend ! No , he did n't ! Yes , I did . I got ta do the right thing . Rudy ! Let 's talk real estate . Looking jiggy , Burt ! Feeling jiggy , Kronk ! All aboard for Pancake Junction ! Tina ! Marge ! You 'll be OK . I 'll help you land on your feet . Do n't worry about us . We 've been contacted by a team of headhunters . I may be giving up everything , but it was the right thing to do . So when you think of our brief time together here , do n't cry for me , Marge and Tina . You did n't ! Afraid so . Oy . Enough with the pity party . You did good . End of story . Back to work . Yeah , but doing good cost me my dream house . - And then ... - Do n't tell me . It cost me my girl . I said do n't tell me . These oven mitts were the last thing she touched , other than my fragile heart ... Oy . ... before she walked out of my life . Roll film ! Ah ! Wrong movie . What 's a troth ? It all happened at Camp Chippamunka . Yeah , right ! We were there for the Chipmunk Challenge . We won Troop of the Year two years running , going for three . OK , Chippers ! - First , we got ta pitch the tents . Hey , Bucky . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Squeakity-squeak . There 's a new troop leader named Birdwell who wants to take away our ... trophy ! Look at them . They 're really snot and polish . Yeah . It 's " spit and polish . " - Snot . - Spit . - Snot ! - Spit ! Whoa . Easy , kids . Spit , snot , same general neighborhood . And do n't worry about this Birdwell guy , whoever he is . The important thing here is that there are no losers . But you always win . Right , Kronk ? We always win . But winning 's not what really counts . Remember our motto . " Keep the focus on fun ! " Two shorts and a long . The Aquatic Games are about to begin ! You know what that means , Tipo ? Right . Last one in 's a rotten egg ! Hup , hup , hup , hup ... Halt ! Left face ! It 's not me ! It 's Mrs . Queetzo . Oh , gosh . Well , we ca n't have that , can we ? Now , uh , um , give me the doll . Yes . I 'll have to have a word with her . Now ... See here , Mrs . Queetzo . Uh , Yoli is a top-notch swimmer , and she 's very , very brave . So steady as you go , Chipper . You 're in excellent hands . Yes . Mm-hmm . Oh , super-duper ! That 's more like it . What did she say ? She 's going to be just tickety-boo . Very well then . And off you go . Hup , hup , hup , hup ... Let the aquatic competition begin ! Yeah ! This is gon na be fun ! Hurry up ! Cannonball ! Cannonball ! Oh , I 'm so proud of my little Chippers . Oh , dear . Are you all right ? Oh , you 're a troop leader . Feet like a pair of landlocked tugboats . Knees like brass doorknobs . Elbows so rough they could take the grain right off a two-by-four . And her eyes . They say the eyes are the window to the soul . Hers were more like steel-reinforced security doors with a combination I just had to crack . No doubt about it . She was the kinda girl you 'd want to bring home to Papi . Wow ! The Chipmunk Handshake of Fellowship , Level Seven . A level attainable only by the most dedicated of troop leaders . You 're good . Well , you 're better . You 're sensational . You 're dazzling . - I 'm Kronk . - I 'm Birdwell . - You 're Birdwell ? - Yes . - But you 're a girl ! - Cannonball ! Ahhh ! - Awesome ! - Phat wave , dude ! Nice form , Chippers . What do you think you 're doing ? ! Uh ... Cannonball ? Duh ! Look at poor Mrs . Queetzo ! She 's all ..... swimming competition . Oh , it 's all about the competition with you ? Yeah . Wait . What ? No matter what it does to the tinies ? Hey , I always put my , uh ... tinies first . Ha-ha ! Obsessed with being first . I knew it ! Fortunately , there are rules about this sort of thing . - What sort of thing ? - Ahem ! Rule 4.7 , paragraph A , subsection 2 , revised : " Troops shall compete in alphabetical order . B before K , except after May , or when sounding like A as in ' neighbor ' or ' weigh ' . " - Says who ? - Says the Official Chipmunk Rulebook . No way ! Way ! Troop Kronk is disqualified ! The aquatic competition goes to Troop Birdwell ! Hey ! That 's not fair ! You ruined the aquatic event for my poppets . But now you 've ruined it for my , uh ... - Poppets . ... poppets ! I knew that ! You should 've thought of that sooner . It just does n't make any sense . Was it loop over , loop under and pull , or loop under , loop over and pull ? Tipo ? You OK , little pal ? We 're gon na lose the trophy because of her . Yeah ! Now , now . Let 's , uh ... keep the focus on fun . - What about her ? - She disqualified us ! Yeah , and you 're the best troop leader ever , Kronk . She ca n't do that to you . Can she ? Just who does she think she is ? Just who does he think he is ? Poor Yoli . You 'll catch your death of cold . And then he tries to act all innocent . Thinks he can charm me with those rippling muscles and that ... that ... crooked smile and those deep , deep sensitive eyes . No ! He ca n't do this to my little Chippers . She ca n't do this to my little Chippers . The gloves are coming off . We 're going mano a womano . Let the games begin ! Stroke ! Stroke ! So . It all comes down to one event . The Chipmunk Cheer-Off ! There 's only one thing to do . Practice , practice , practice ! Do whatever it takes to win ! Here 's how we 're gon na do it ! We 're gon na hit them hard . Come at them with everything we got . Get out there and give a 110 percent ! Whatever happened to " keep the focus on fun " ? We ca n't let him down . We just got ta win that trophy for Kronk ! You know what I 'd do ? Cheat . What am I hearing ? You ca n't do that ! - Nah-nah-nah-nah . - Stop it ! Ha-ha ! Crybaby , crybaby , stick your head in pie , baby ! Make him stop ! Make him ... Hey ! Kronk said , " Do whatever it takes to win . " Right . Whatever it takes . Uh-uh-uh ! Spirit smiles ! I want to see spirit smiles ! Yes . That 's more like it ! Peppy and poised ! Remember , do n't think of your opponents as a rival troop . - Think of them as ... ... the enemy ! Layout . Very good . This is no ordinary cheer-off . Basket toss . Higher ! This is a test of everything we stand for ! - The culmination of all of our efforts ! - You call that a backflip ? By this time tomorrow , the trophy will be ours ! Right , Chipmunks ? Chipmunks ? Oh , man ! This really stinks . Yeah . I want to go swimming . I want to have some fun . I want to go home . This is all her fault . This is all his fault . Well , if there 's one sure-fire way to cheer up a Chipmunk it 's raisin bread . OK , flour . Sugar , raisins , yeast . Take that , you ... You , you , you , you ... Take that ! " Upset " ? She 's beating me in effigy . But her soul yearns for the soothing salve of human kindness . Go to her . Go . Hey , look . Are n't those your eggs ? " Kronk 's . Property of Kronk . Do not touch , except for Kronk . " Hey ! What are you doing with my eggs ? What are you doing with my raisins , sir ? - These are n't yours . - " Birdwell 's raisins . Property of Birdwell . Do not touch except for Birdwell . " Huh . You think I would have seen that . - I need those raisins . - I need them more . - You 're ruining this . - You 're wrecking it . - You disqualified us ! - You tried to drown us ! - This is all your fault . - This is all your fault ! - Is not . - Is too ! - You twit !.. your kids are really unhappy , huh ? Rock-bottom , actually . I 'm the worst troop leader ever . I 'm the worst troop leader ever . - How did we go wrong ? - I just became so competitive . Yes , but I 'm even more competitive than you . You mean like that ? Hey , I like it when you laugh . I 've got a proposition . I 've got a proposition . - My eggs , your raisins . - Oh ! We could bake beautiful bread together . Get out your oven mitts . Things are about to get hot . ? Earth , Wind Fire : Let 's Groove I 'm queen of the world ! Come on . Throw caution to the wind . I ca n't . You 'll laugh at me . Do n't you trust me ? I do trust you . Whoa ! It 's like a whole new you . Really ? Uh-huh . I think this has been the best night of my whole life . Me too . I 'm fine ! Dear Papi , remember how I 've never been able to meet the right girl ? Uh , any girl ? Well , I finally found the woman of my dreams . She 's everything you could want in a woman and more . Do n't get too excited . We 'll take it nice and slow at first . Mazel tov ! We 'll marry in a fancy ceremony and have lots of kids . Love , Kronk . Perfect ! He found his one true love ! That is so beautiful ! Can I have a moment , please ? Turn away . OK . OK . All better . Go , go , go . Go back to the funny . I 'm bringing you down . - Good morning , Chippers ! - We 've got a surprise for you . Raisin bread ! The one sure-fire way to cheer up a Chipmunk ! Got ta tell you , Chippers , I 'm , uh not proud of how I 've been acting lately . That means no more hostility quarreling ... ... one-upmanship ... We 're doing it again , are n't we ? They 're finishing each other 's sentences . Yeah , it 's creepy . But nice creepy . The competition between our troops has gotten out of hand . Which brings us to this afternoon 's final event . - The Chipmunk Cheer-Off . - You 're not canceling the cheer-off ? Yeah . We 've been working on our routines all year ! Very well , but only on one condition . From now on , we want you to play fair ... Be good sports and ... Keep the focus on fun ! I 'm so proud of them . Hey , where 's Tipo ? Kronk is gon na love this . Scrape out these seed pods , mash them into itching powder , sneak the powder into their chalk at the cheer-off , and they 'll be completely humiliated while we achieve total domination ! - Team spirit ? - Go , team ! Go , team ! Chaca , there is no " I " in " team . " But there 's a " U " in " euphoric . " And there 's a " me " in , uh " mediocre . " I got you something . For me ? I know this is all really new . And I hope you wo n't think that I 'm moving too fast , but there comes a time when a man 's got ta say how he feels . Oh , Kronk . Monogrammed oven mitts . Oh , just my size . Good luck , Kronky-poo . Thanks , Miss Birdy-poo . Yo , crowd , let 's get loud ! Go , Chipmunks ! Awesome ! - All right ! - Yeah ! Yes ! Oh , yay ! That was wonderful , Kronky-poo ! You 're gon na be even better , not that it matters who wins . - We 've already won . - We 've already won . You do n't want to fall . I 'm not worried . I know you 'd be there to catch me . Say what ? ! This is gon na be so awesome ! - I know . They 're really good . - Yeah , but we 're gon na win . I cheated , just like you said . Oh , that 's great , Tipo . Wait , what ? I put itching powder in their chalk . You said do whatever it takes to win . I know you 'd be there to catch me . Noooooo ! " Tipo 's Itching Powder . Property of Tipo . Do not touch except for ... " Tipo ? ! How could you ? I 'm so disappointed . Oh , no . What am I gon na do ? Eh , let the kid take the rap . He 'll do easy time . You put the idea in his head . Look at him out there . - He 's six . - Uh-oh , the lip . - Forever ? - Heartbreak City . - No . - So you 're gon na weasel out while they send Tipo off to the big house ? You forgetting something ? You want this , you need that . Dangerous . You could have hurt somebody . I can not believe that you would disgrace the Chipmunk name in this manner ! But Tipo needs me . Let him go ! It 's all my fault . Kronky-poo ? You told Tipo to cheat ? I told him ... do whatever it takes to win . Wait ! - It was all a big mistake . - I 'll say it was . The biggest mistake of my life ! I thought I could trust you . But Miss Birdy-poo ... Do n't ever call me that again ! On second thought , do n't call me ever ! She 's gone . And all I have to remember her by are these . Now I 've got nothing . Stat ! How can you think of fondue at a time like this ? Look , you made the right choice . You saved the kid . But I lost the girl . Now I 'm a two-time loser , and my father 's gon na be here any minute . More like any second . Ah ! What am I gon na do ? Just tell him the truth . I ca n't handle the truth ! Where am I going to find a wife and kids and house on a hill ? How 's dinner coming ? I got ta get the wife and kids back to our house on the hill . You want to borrow my house ? - And me ? - And them , if it 's no trouble . Kronk , you should be ashamed of yourself . Trust me , I am , but not as much as I 'd be if Papi finds out I 'm a failure . He 'll come with everything . What 's wrong with Kronk ? Duh . You made him look like a big fat liar in front of Miss Birdwell ! Hey , do n't guilt-trip the kid ! - It 's not his fault . - No , he 's right . I 've got to help him . Now come on , Chich , he 's our friend . Pacha ! You saw the Nostril Flare of Total Rejection . We have to do something before his father gets here . Too late . He 's here . - Ah ! It 's him ! - I know what to do ! I 'll just wait here , like a sane person . Kronker ? Kronker ? - Kronker , front and center ! - Yes , sir ! Oh ! Papi ! What do I look like , your Aunt Matilda ? Put her there ! Papi ? Papi ? Huh ? Oh ! - I 'm Chicha . - Chicha . How 'd this knucklehead ever land a catch like you ? Well , he just asked . Really . And these are my grandkids ? Front and center , kids , and ... let me have a look at you . I said front and center ! Names and ages ! Chaca , sir ! Age seven and three-quarters , sir ! And this is Yupi . He 's only a half . And , uh , that 's my house up there , on the hill . Wow ! I never thought I 'd live to see this . You , of all people , with a wife , kids and a house on a hill . Son , I do n't know what to say . Kronkers ! Hoo-hoo-hoo ! Now I really do n't know what to say . Who 's this ... lovely lady ? Well , she 's , uh ... - I 'm Kronk 's wi ... - Mother-in-law ! - Granny ! - Pach ita ! Now I see where Chicha gets her looks . OK . Who 's hungry ? Let 's eat . Yeah , I 'm starving . I hope the chef here knows what he 's doing . Yeah , so do I . Whoa , little fella ! Where are you going in such a hurry ? Kronk 's in trouble ! His father 's here ! He does n't have a wife or kids or a house on the hill . I 've got to help him ! Kronk 's in trouble ? I know what to do . Hang on , big fella ! The cavalry 's comin ' ! Ah , well , is n't this nice , Papi ? You , me , Chicha , Mom . So , are you proud of me ? Even a little ? Humph . I 'm just glad to see you gave up all those crazy ideas - about cooking and talking to animals . - Kronk ! Yoo-hoo ! Yeah . Crazy . - What 's he talking about ? Him ! - Him who ? - Guy who was here . - What ? - Why 's he asking you about cooking ? ! - Yeah . That 's weird . It 's a ... a business deal . Oh , Kronk 's always got something cooking . Oh , yeah . Speaking of cooking , what does it take to get food here ? - Talk to the chef . - I 'll go ! Perfect . Gives us more time to get to know each other . Oh ... Oh ! Lucky me . I ca n't do this . - Look . Fondue night was your idea . - Ow , ow , ow ! Fondue ! They do n't get fed , they come after you . Wait . I 'll cook . Feel that ! Like a python . Ordering . One bucket of brie , two Gouda gulps and a flaming fountain of fondue . Cardio special . Got it . And a side salad with poppy seed dressing . Papi ? ! Anybody up there ? Where 's our food ? I 've worked up quite an appetite . More water . Be right back . Kronk ! I mean ... Kronkles ! OK . Stoke the fire . Stir the fondue . Chop the onions , lie to Papi . - Machu Picchu ! - Kronky-wonky ! Who is this ? - Why , I 'm the lovely Mrs . Kronk . - Kronker ! Uh ... Right . I 'll go check on dinner . Hey ! Is that any way to treat the lovely Mrs . Kronk ? I thought I was the lovely Mrs . Kronk . Look at us . Putting on dresses . Pretending to be women . Kronk ! What are you doing ? Dinner rush . Four specials up and a party of ten in at 8:30 . - Kronk ! - Kronk ? Kronk ! Let me get this straight . She 's Mrs . Kronk and she 's Mrs . Kronk ? - Papi , I can explain . - Or maybe not . Is there anyone in this town who is n't Mrs . Kronk ? - Daddy ! - How about them ? - Who are they ? - We 're Kronk 's adorable kids ! Oh ! Kronk ! - Sweetheart ! - Tina , Marge . - Marge . - Tina . - Kronk ! - Well , at least that 's everybody . Boom , baby ! Like how I weaseled myself in the movie ? Nice . - Kuzco ? - How you doing , hot stuff ? Hot stuff ? Kronker ! So this is right about where we started . Miserable . Covered in cheese . Trying to hold on to a big fat lie ! Papi I have a confession . I 'm not who you think I am . I , uh ... I 'm just a humble fry cook . And a delivery boy . That 's not all . Chicha 's not my wife . None of these folks are my wives . And these are n't my kids . And Pachita not even a woman . I lied to you , Papi . I just wanted you to be proud of me . I just wanted to get one of these . But all I ever got from you was ... Yeah , that . I 'm a failure . The truth is I 've got nothing . But Kronk , you 've got us . And I would n't trade you guys for anything . Well , that would explain why you do n't have anything . For your information , Kronk used to have a big house . On a hill . - But he gave it away to us old folks . - And he had a girlfriend too . They baked us raisin bread . He gave up all those things to protect his friends . You were actually listening to my stories ? I was weeping on the inside . Wait a second . I really would n't trade you guys for anything . Not even for a thumbs up . Not yet , you do n't . I 'm proud of you , son . Ohhh ... Whoo ! Papi ! Come here , you little squirt . Kronk , wait ! Tipo ! How 's my little Chipper ? I brought a friend . Hello , Kronky-poo . Miss Birdy-poo . I 've missed you so much . I missed you more . I thought ... We 'd never see each other again . You know what this means . If they 're finishing each other 's sentences then it must be true love . - Kronk ! - Awesome ! Huh ? Oh , how cute ! ? B5 : Let 's Groove ? Eartha Kitt : Feel Like a Million

All you ever talk about is hanging out with your buddies , and now you 're acting like a total freak . My God , what the hell ? Hey , what 's your problem ? - Nothing , man . - Use a coaster ? You sound like my mom . I know , man . When you 're in dad mode , you just think about stuff like that . This is n't about you being a dad , all right ? This is about you celebrating 40 year ... 40 years . Think about that , right ? It 's party time . You got ta celebrate that . You ca n't get that time back . That should make you a little insane .

GARY : Yes , that 's it ! - And I do n't need a coaster ! - You 're a punk !

Oh , damn it . Oh ... I 'm so sorry . OK . I 'll be right there . I have to let ' em in . I told you not to answer the phone , dumb ass . I know . I have to let ' em back in .

You bet . I only got a second . I got ta get back to work . -  - Back to work . If you use coasters , you would n't get marks on the table like this . Oh , yeah , I tell Salome all the time but she does n't always get it . You know , I 've been thinking . Maybe I should take a crack at that playhouse out there . - What do you mean ? - Just spruce it up a little . Make it look like an actual house . Never mind . Maybe I should n't say anything .  Oh , you 're right , Joanie .  So , please , try to be nice . OK ? WALT : I-I do n't mean to be critical , but , you know , your effort is just kind of lacking . - JOAN : Walt ! - I think Salome likes the house . He just means you did n't put your heart into it . But that 's OK . Not everyone is good at putting their heart into things . I 'm sorry I 'm not a professional wood person . I know . We can work on it together . - You wan na help me ? - That 's a great idea . You know , I-I ... That is a great idea , but I have to ... - So we 'll get dessert then . -  Yes !

Perry , you 'll have to show us Salome 's fancy new guitar . Did n't you guys get her a new guitar for the talent show ? Oh , yeah , yeah , we did . Well , where is it ? Uh ... I got it . WALT : He probably lost it . No , I did n't lose it . WALT : Well , then , where is it , Perry ? -  - Um ... Can you guys gim me just one second ? Hey , are you coming back or what ? PERRY : Yeah , yeah . I 'm coming back . PERRY : Are you sure ? It 's got , like , a dinosaur on it ? Um , I 'm very sure I see no guitar , or a dinosaur . Hey , I got a question for you . Is it OK if we put in an order for room service ? Room service ? Yeah , maybe just a couple of simple things . Maybe some ... pizzas , some bits , kinda thing . - PERRY : No , man . That shit 's expensive . - Oh , yeah . GARY : But the thing is , you know , we 're very hungry . Why did n't you eat before you came ? Because it 's a birthday party . There 's food at parties . Are you sure we ca n't put an order in , because the thing is I already placed one and everything . PERRY : What ? No , man ! Call ' em back and cancel . - Gary . Sorry , man . We got hungry .  Goddamnit , Gary . Do n't do anything else . I 'll be right back .  - Did you find the guitar , Perry ? - Yeah , it 's ...  I know where it is . Oh , shit . The garbage was today . I did n't put it out . It ... I 'll see ya . WALT : Told you he lost it .  Hey , Denise , have you seen a guitar around here ? - I put it in the office . - Oh , my God . I thought I lost it . DENISE : But Jake 's having a meeting in there .  - Perry ... - Hey , what 's up ? What are you doing here ? I 'm just looking for Salome 's guitar . Have you seen it around ? Right over there . Am I interrupting something ? No . No , man . How you doing , Perry ? What are you guys talking about ? Uh ... we were ... W-why do n't you have a seat , Perry ? Uh ... so ... in your father 's will , where he left you guys the business , he also included a little provision pertaining to your stake in the ownership . What little provision ? Basically , if I feel like you 're not pulling your weight , I have the option of buying you out of the company . - Buying me out ? - Yeah . What does that mean ? That means that you would n't work here anymore . Or receive any of the profits . Whoa , what would I do then ? And what does that mean for me ? Well , first of all , you 'd get a nice chunk of money . Oh , yeah . Yeah . Uh , and then you 'd have to find another job ... It does n't seem like that 's an option . I am pulling my weight . If I may , gentlemen , uh , actually , he did n't actually stipulate for Jake 's weight . Oh , my God . That figures . He always liked hanging out with you more anyway . - That 's not true . - I think it ... You know , it 's just ... Jake 's older . What ? He 's not older . No , I 'm younger . Oh . Sorry . I ... I thought you ... You seemed older . Got it . Yeah , we got that . You actually seemed younger , Perry , so ... No , dude , I 'm the older brother . He 's the older brother . Uh , Drew , do you wan na give me a second with my brother ? - Sure . No problem . - Thank you , buddy . - It was great to see you . - You too , guys .   He does n't know what he 's talking about . Are you thinking about buying me out of the family business ? Hold on a second , OK ? I 'm trying to help you . That 's all I 'm trying to do . You 're going to take it like I 'm doing something personal to you , and I 'm not . I just ... I look at you , and , you know , you remind me of one of those days when it 's rainy and sunny at the same time . You know what I 'm saying ? What are you talking about ? I 'm talking about that I think you 're confused , Perry . I am not confused . I think you 're very , very , very confused . I am not confused . I like rainy sunny days . They 're weird . No , not rainy sunny days . I 'm talking about a sunny rainy day . You 're confused , and you 're confusing everyone around you . Are you happy , are you sad ? It 's coming down ... Forget it . Look ... just be a regular day . You know ? Like everyone else . I mean , I feel ... Look , I 'm gon na be honest with you . I feel like you 're scared . You 're scared to live in the normal world like the rest of us . You 've always been like that . Well , what am I supposed to say to Karen ? Do n't worry about Karen . I talked to Karen . She supports this . You talked to my wife about firing me ? I talked to your wife about her opinion , not about firing you . I 'm not firing you . Look , if you wan na do this ... - If you fully commit to the store ... - No , no , no . - You do n't , right ? - No , no ... No , whatever . I 'm a rainy sunny day , Jake . - No , you 're a sunny rainy day . - I 'm a sunny rainy day , Jake . - Yes , you 're confusing . - Whatever . I 'm outta here . You say you wan na do it , then you say you do n't wanna . - I 'm outta here . - Perry ... I love you too . Perry , come on . Do n't do this . PERRY : You 're an asshole .  Perry ! Perry ! Perry ? MAN : Perry ! There he is . What 's up , big man ? What 's up ? Hey . I-I got ta ... I got ta go . Hey , what do you think ? Snow blowers ? Snow shovels ? - Yeah , what do you reckon ? - I have no idea . - You 're gon na have to ask my brother . - You got ta play . Guys , we ... Honestly , we have nothing in common . Well , we have everything in common . -  Another way to look at it . - Yeah . Our kids do everything together . They go to school together , play together , do dance together . - Overnights . - Overnights , birthdays . - Soccer practice . - I see this guy 12 times a week . You think I like him ? I do n't like him . He 's a nerd . I do n't like him , either .  Oh , man . But we share a common bond . That 's just the way it is . I got ta go . Yeah .  WOMAN : Perry ! - Hi again . - Hey .

OK , cool .   MAN : What 's up ? -  -  Oh , my God . Finally , bro .   Gary ! What the hell is going on here ? - What do you mean ? - Who are all these people ? - Friends . - Whose friends ?

Oh , my God . How you doing ? You got a hangover ? Yeah . It 's good . I , uh , I concocted a remedy . It 's Scotch and tomato juice . That sounds disgusting . It 's better if you use a really good Scotch , which this is amazing shit . Have you tried this ? Oh , my God ! You drank the Scotch ? I had to . I had a hangover , man . - Gary , what did I say ? - I do n't know . I said do n't drink the Scotch . - Hey , I 'm sorry . - Oh , you 're sorry ! Oh , great ! - My God . Everybody , shut up ! - Hey !

All right .  How 's the couch ? Sucks .  I 'm sorry . You think this is something we could look back on and laugh about someday ? I have to be mad first . How long is that gon na take ? Long . So this means I get a free pass , right ? A freak-out pass if I ever decide to go off the deep end ? Sure . You can freak out if you want to . Just let me know in advance . You do n't want the whole house to burn down , do you ? You know what freaks me out ? We 're parents . Us . - Parents .

Sara told me about the loan we gave her . It 's just for a lawyer . Her ex is trying to take custody of matty . I do n't care what it 's for . Then what ? Look , I know I did n't make the kind of money that you made before we got married , but I thought we were partners . And partners discuss things like loans before they happen . Is this really about us sharing our money , or is this about something else ? If you 're going give our money to your ex-girlfriend , it would be nice if you told your wife .

Yeah , ' cause I 'm beating the pants off of them ! No , because you 're a mean , competitive - - rhymes with " mitch . " Excuse me ? I could n't hold it in . You made me laugh . I brought your shoes . I thought you said you loved everything about me . Yes . So , I get competitive.That 's who I am . Okay , well , maybe some things we both may need to work on , like ... maybe not yelling at little boys . In that case , I would like you to stop interrupting me and using the term " orifice " when you mean " office . " But you always laugh when I say , " I 'll call youat your orifice . " The first three times you said it , yes . Okay . That hurt . Does this make you not want to marry me ? What ? No . I want to marry you like crazy . I just do n't want to play checkers with you . Ever . Do n't do that again . Yeah , but I thought you - - yeah , I lied . Hey ! Where 's jack ? He 's right behind us . Hey . Hey , jack . Hey . Hey , man , thanks for helping us out . Yeah . Yeah , you could have been killed out there . Yeah , I know that . Yeah , well , marin did n'T . You did a lousy job of protecting her . That 's ironic coming from you , jack . Now you do n't want to hurt her . Maybe you should leave her alone . Are n't you marrying someone else ? That has nothing to do with this.Really ? That 's the reason she was upon that mountain to begin with . If you want to blame someone , blame yourself . Break it up . Calm down , jack . Everything 's okay . * I did n't think so * Cash ? Sorry , princess . I 'm sorry . Do n't worry about it . I got ta go get some ice for my hand . It must be nic ehaving two men fight over you . One would be nice .

Hey . What did he say to make you do that ? Uh , he said that I was the reason you were up there . He 's partly right . I was trying to get some closure to us , I guess . On a mountain ? It involved rocks . Did you get closure ? Why do you care , jack ? It 's , uh , hard for me , too , marin . I know it 's unfair of me to say that , but it 's true . There was . We 're gon na be okay . Yeah . Thanks . What , for punching him ? For saying it was real . Storm 's over ! * Yesterday , he said my eyes ... * Sometimes , it 's not until a storm comes that things get unearthed . We get to see what 's underneath . The dark secrets and the truths that in the light of day we keep hidden . * I would n't feel this way , he said * * he said * * he said it 's crazy * for some , the truth will make them feel closer . For others , it will make them more alone . Hey , sara , take this for matty . He seemed to like it . But it 's for the baby . Um , I 'm not sure I want her to believe in fairy tales . * ... And apologies * * he says it 's crazy how love stays with me * * yeah , you know * Pain will get uprooted ..... some pain still too deep to be seen by human eyes . But in time , as we replant ourselves , we will be thankful . Because , like the roots of a tree , it is what lies beneath that allows us to grow ... together or apart . Apologies 
@@5261241 What happened ? Are you okay ? Yeah . Nothing a little sleep ca n't fix . - Here , let me heal that . - No . - Come on . - I said no . Piper , this is ridiculous . We have to talk about this . Actually , what we need to do is find where the next demon attack is gon na be , and I think I just did . A pentagram , naturally . What do you want from me ? What do I have to do to prove that I 've changed , that I 'm okay ? Did Phoebe and Paige finish making the dye ? You did n't answer my question . Oh , I have to answer your questions , but you do n't have to answer mine ? What question ? The same question I 've been asking you for several days now . What are n't you telling me ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . Oh . Right . Excuse me . They 're not working with the Avatars . Oh , yeah ? How do you know ? I do n't ! I mean , I just ... I do n't think they 're the threat everyone thinks they are . Why ? Because , if they 're so powerful , would n't they have attacked by now ? Oh , sending a demon to possess you does n't count ? Still , I think that was their way of communicating with me , with us . Why did n't they just try calling you , Leo ? Are you hiding something ? No . Yes . Are you sure those are gon na work ? Yeah . As sure as I can be at 5 a.m . Before you go - Do you know where the demon 's gon na attack ? They 're making a pentagram , and there 's only one point left , so we need to get there before sunrise . Piper , you ca n't walk out on this ! You 're right . We should orb . What happened ? Nothing a little sleep wo n't fix . It 's fine . Did n't you just say that ? What ? Nothing . I think I found where the next demon attack is gon na be . A pentagram , naturally . Did Phoebe and Paige finish that dye yet ? I do n't know . Excuse me . Why did you do this ? We did n't . You did . You need to be more careful about your new powers , Leo . Reversing time can be very dangerous . Charmed Season 7 Episode 09 " There 's something about Leo " Transcript : Intrepid . Synchro : Greatouille . Our powers are not meant to be used for personal reasons , Leo . You know that . I know . I did n't mean to . It just happened . Yes , because you wanted it to happen . You must be more careful in the future , learn to control your emotions . Control is the first discipline of an Avatar . What do you mean ? Reversing time the way you did requires great power . It drains the Collective , and it puts us at risk . And we must remain at full strength if we are to defeat the forces of evil , if we are to implement the change . I get that , but Piper 's my wife . She knows something 's up . I ca n't keep lying to her . We understand your position , Leo ... But to tell her outright might cause her to overreact and mistakenly view us as a threat . As might her sisters as well . They must come to the truth in their own time and in their own way , just as you did . What if they do n't ? What if Piper never sees the future you promised ? You must help her to see it , Leo . You must gently guide her to it . This is the burden that you took upon becoming an Avatar . I 'm not just an Avatar . And you will get it back , Leo . You will , once we have ended this perpetual battle between good and evil , once we have brought forth a better way . Okay , it 's almost dawn , and nothing 's happening . Can we go home and go to sleep now ? Shh . Just stay focused . Right , focused . Maybe you drew the pentagram wrong . I know how to draw a pentagram , thank you . Yeah , but did you use a felt marker ? The thickness of the tip led us astray a couple of blocks , huh ? We are not going home . What 's the matter with you guys ? Do you wan na save an innocent or not ? Of course we do . It 's just , uh ... What ? It 's just what ? Now you 're not telling me something ? Leo 's what . What ? We just think that you may have been so eager to avoid Leo that you miscalculated the demon attack . Why ? Why are you so upset with him ? He 's been an Angel lately . Yeah , well , that 's the problem . He 's been too perfect , even for him , and I just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop . Why do n't you just talk to him about it ? I have , about a dozen times , and he just thinks I 'm crazy or something , which is why I am channeling my frustration into something useful . I just want this demon to attack soon , so I can make my breakfast date with Kyle . Yeah , see , breakfast is not a date . Dinner 's a date . Lunch is definitely maybe a date . Breakfast ? Always just breakfast . As long as he does n't talk about the Avatars , it can be breakfast , lunch , or dinner , and I will consider it a date . Get the dye . They have to become visible to attack . Let 's go . Who the hell are you ? It wo n't matter . Kill them . Throw the dye ! Energy ball ! Heads up , guys . Well , that did n't go too well . They were a lot more powerful than I thought . He 's still alive . Okay , let 's get him to magic school , and we 'll find out who they are . And make more potions . The innocent has been marked and territory staked . Soon , every mortal within the pen will be ours alone to prey upon . But the innocent lives . Our rivals - Can no more easily kill than we can ... now that The Charmed Ones are protecting him . Then how is the territory staked ? As long as he lives , the Sokols could still try to claim it for themselves . And we want them to try ... So we 'll put them on our rivals ' trail ... by making them think the Sokols attacked them . So , this place is great . Yeah ? Y-you sure ? I mean , you - - you like the place ? Well , I 've never had breakfast here , but I 'm ... I 'm sure it 's terrific . I guess I should 've asked you out to dinner , huh ? It 's fine . I 'm up this early anyway . Well , you know , I figured since we got the first kiss out of the way and everything ... Out of the way ? Sorry . I did n't mean that . I did not mean that . I ... I ... I just , you know , I 'm rusty . All Avatars all the time ? Yeah , something like that . It 's just that I 've been chasing them for so long , you know ? It has n't left much time for a social life . It 's just that they 're so close , Paige . I mean , I know it , you know ? I-I can feel it . But ... you promised . You 're right . You 're right . That 's it . No more Avatar talk , I swear . Good . That 's a good start . What ? It 's , uh - - it 's vibrating . It just tickles a little , that 's all . It 's off . I promise . No more distractions . That 's my emergency line . I got ta take this . Sorry . Brody . What ? All right , as soon as you get those numbers , you call me , all right ? Intel just detected another unusual power spike in the area . Paige , this could mean some serious Avatar activity . Do n't you know what this means ? Yeah ... yeah , I do . It means that you eat alone . I 'm sorry . Paige , come on . Idiot ! I mean , already today , I 've made demon dye . I 've saved an innocent . I e-mailed in my column , plucked my eyebrows If it was n't for sleep deprivation , I would be okay . What about the demons ? Yeah , I could n't find anything in the book to help identify them . But I did get to read up on the family history . Did you know that Beatrice Warren only had one leg ? What is this ? You making spaghetti sauce ? No . That 's , uh , demon blood . I got it from the salvage yard . I was gon na use it to scry for them after I make the vanquishing potion . Wow . Jacklebeet . So , exactly which state are you trying to blow off the map ? I do n't wan na take any chances . We need two kitchens . Do you know where the beetle toe is ? I think it 's up in the attic . Yeah , if you 're talking about Leslie , you 're absolutely right . But my big sister gave me some advice that I 'm gon na give back to you . Stop dodging . Just talk to Leo . On the subject of dodging , who called this morning ? Yeah . See , your " I 'm covering something " look has n't worked since the sixth grade , so spill . Ok , but you ca n't tell Paige , ' cause I do n't want her to get all paranoid . Why would she get all paranoid ? Darryl actually thinks Brody had something to do with Sheridan 's disappearance . Yeah . That 's why I 'm keeping it low-key . Darryl 's on his way over . We 're gon na talk about it while Paige is on her date . Oh , he 's talking to us again ? Kind of . Baby steps . I 'll be in the attic . Paige is out on a date . What did you find out ? Nothing . Nothing . Okay , well , nothing is good , right ? No . I mean , I ca n't find anything . It 's like Sheridan 's disappeared off the face of the earth . What are you saying ? I think that maybe Brody did something to make Sheridan disappear ... Something bad , maybe . No . I do n't believe that . That 's because you do n't want to believe that . Brody may have saved your butts ... I get that ... but if he did something to hurt Sheridan ... wrong is wrong . Okay . Well , maybe I can get a premonition and see where she is . No . No magic . I told you . I 've done some soul-searching . I wan na help again , but I do n't wan na go there anymore . Darryl , you got ta get over this . Hey , Darryl . Uh , I thought you were on your date . Yeah . So did I . Look , um ... tell Piper I said hello , okay ? Take care . Take care . We 're friends again ? Yeah . Weird . Bygones . Leo , please , this is not the time or place . I just want my family back , Piper . I just want you back . I do n't wan na talk about this right now . Why not ? ! Because this is a little dicey here , okay ? I know that , and that 's why we need to talk . No , not that , this . If I make one mistake , I can blow up the entire house , okay ? So , this is a bad time . I just wish you 'd trust me . Yeah , well , maybe you should try telling me the truth . This is so frustrating . This ca n't keep happening , Leo . I ca n't keep doing this . You must keep up pretenses . There 's no other way . There is another way . I could tell her the truth . - Leo ... - You do n't understand . I know Piper . She does n't wan na live like this any more than I do . She hates hunting demons all the time . She wants nothing but the best for herself , for her family , for all of us . She can handle the truth . I know she can . But if she ca n't , if she 's not open to our way , it would risk everything we hope to achieve , everything we covet . And cause her to lose perspective in the process , ignore what should n't be ignored . Which would put her at risk as well . There 's too much at stake , Leo . She can handle it . He needs to see for himself . But what of the risk ? It 's no greater than that of him ... Our powers are not inexhaustible . What is the matter ? I , uh -- I need to tell you something . I 'm listening . Well , the reason I know the demons are n't working with the Avatars is ... is because I 'm an Avatar . What ? Oh , my god . Piper ? No ! You stay away from me . What happened ? - Let me help . - Do n't ! Piper , please . Can someone please just tell us what happened ? The potion blew up , and , uh , Leo 's an Avatar . What ? ! What ? Oh , you know , the gathering storm , looming threat , that would be Leo . We 're not a threat . We 're trying to save the world from itself . Wait ... did he just say " we " ? I think he just said " we . " You know , you wanted the truth , and I told you . Handle what , that you 're what everybody is afraid of , even the Elders ? They 're afraid because they do n't understand . They ca n't understand . The Avatars are beyond Good and Evil . They 're everything we 've been searching for , a life without demons . Okay , he 's cracked . Absolutely . No . I have never been more clear about anything in my life . Piper , I beg you not to be closed to this . It 's everything we 've been searching for , everything we wanted , I promise . I think you need to take the boys to Magic School . - But ... - Please . I need time to think about all of this . Are you sure you can trust him ? I can trust my husband with our children . Now , please , go . Do you think he 's telling the truth ? It would be a really stupid lie if he was n't , do n't you think ? Sorry . It 's okay ... Yeah , but - Look , just remake the potion for me , and I 'll go get cleaned up , and be careful of the beetletoe . Okay , we have bigger things to worry about than potions . I agree . We have to save Leo . Yeah . We 're gon na have to ask for Kyle 's help . Now what ? Put them on . Why ? Because we 're going to attack The Charmed Ones next . Malvoc , that 's suicide . Only if we die , but I only plan to fight long enough for them to identify us , as Sokols . Then our enemies becomes their enemies . Fine . They 'll vanquish them , but others will still come to challenge us for the territory . They wo n't be able to after we kill the innocent . Those ancient rules are etched in ... brimstone . Something 's happened , Leo . Look , I do n't have time for this . I have to get back to Pip -- We 've detected a power surge , a time shift . That could only mean one thing . The Avatars are making their move . How do you know it 's them ? Because no demon has this kind of power , not since the Source . So ... What do you want from me ? We want you to alert The Charmed Ones . We expect that the Avatars will be coming after them first . What is it ? Nothing . I just do n't know how much we know about ' em , that 's all . We know they 're a threat . Why , because they have power ? Yes . The kind of power that in the wrong hands could be a danger to us all . Ok , so , are we a threat ? I 'm sorry . Elders . How do we know they 're not a benevolent power I mean , who are we to judge them before even meeting them ? If they were benevolent , they would n't lurk , insidiously waiting to make their move . They would show themselves . This is no time to lose your faith in all that we 're about , Leo , despite all that 's happened in the past . We need you on our side . Have you seen Phoebe and Paige ? Are n't they upstairs making potions ? No . How are the boys ? They 're fine . Miss Donovan 's with them . And the innocent ? Sleeping , still under the effects of the potions . How are you ? How am I ? I mean , with all this . I do n't know . I have questions . Well , you can ask me . I can answer them now . And the Avatars are gon na give us that how ? By using their powers ... our powers ... to change what has always been , to remake what is . That sounds like a load of crap . I know it does , but it 's not . You know , for all we know , they 're exactly like everything else we 've been fighting . They wan na end everything we 've been fighting against , put an end to the struggle once and for all . That 's impossible . I know . I used to think it was , too , but now I know it 's not . They wan na make the world better for everybody . And those floating heads that tormented you , they made your life better ? That was just a way to ... get my attention , make me open to a new idea . Leo ... Piper . Think about it . A demon-free world ? It 's everything we always dreamed about . They really want that innocent . I just wish I knew why . There 'll be more of them . Yeah , well , at least we have a way to find them now . I do n't mean just them , Piper . I mean demons . And they 'll just keep coming back , over and over , just like they always have , unless we let the Avatars stop it ... Forever . Oh , Paige . I was , uh ... Okay . I 'm sorry about breakfast . Ok , I did n't handle it well . And ... and , look , I know what you 're gon na say . I 'm obsessed about the Avatars . I know . That 's not it ! It 's just that -- Look , it 's not gon na happen again . All right ? I promise . It 's not that ! Leo 's an Avatar ! He told us this morning . What ? How ? We do n't know . He ... We do n't know exactly what it means . Where are you going ? Parking sucks in this city ! How 's he taking it ? Hello ? It 's Darryl . I 'm stumped . Maybe you could use a little hocus-pocus to find out what Brody did with Sheridan . Ok , uh , but now 's not really a good time , so can I call you back in a little bit ? All right . Bye . What are you looking for ? This . Does he know where the Others are ? " Others " who ? The other Avatars ! No . He did n't say . Why ? What is that ? It 's a potion . For what ? For killing Avatars . Where is he ? Kyle , would you stop , please ? We are not gon na let you kill Leo . You do n't understand . He 's an Avatar now . No , he 's actually our brother-in-law . One potion . That 's all you have . You can not get even with them all . Oh , the hell I ca n't . Their powers are all tied together . You kill one of them , it weakens them all . They become vulnerable . This is ridiculous ! Leo did not kill your parents ! If he 's one of them , he did . He just became one of them ! Look , we did n't come to you so you can kill Leo . We came to you to help us get rid of them . This is the only way to get rid of them . When my parents uncovered this , they did n't just discover a potion . They discovered a battle that happened five thousand years ago over our very future . They fought the Avatars then , and we got ta fight ' em now . What happened in here ? Piper ? Upstairs ! At least we know she 's okay . You wo n't even be able to get that bottle out of your hand . We 'll see . Look , I get that this is about your parents . I do , really . Yes ! It is about my parents , and , no , you do n't get it . The hell I do n't . My parents were killed , too , remember ? Paige , my parents were murdered . Look ... Leo is not the bad guy here . For all we know , he was ... he was brainwashed or possessed or something . Just , please , give us a minute . Just wait down here . Please ? Just do n't let him go , all right ? I 've spent twenty years looking for the Avatars . I 'm not about to lose them now . Piper , what happened ? Are you okay ? No thanks to you . Where the hell were you ? I was at Kyle 's . What were you doing there ? Frankly ? Trying to save you . Trying to save me . I do n't need saving . I know what I 'm doing . Do you know Kyle 's parents were killed by the Avatars ? That 's impossible . It goes against everything they believe in . Well , you 're gon na have to come up with a better argument than that if you go downstairs . Why is that ? He 's downstairs ? Why is he downstairs ? You do n't wan na know . He thinks you 're a threat , Leo , to all of us . Well , he 's wrong . How do you know ? Because ! Look , I know this is a shock to everyone , but he did n't have to tell us the truth . He would n't have if it was a bad thing . Even the Elders think so . Because they do n't understand . So , what , we 're just supposed to take your word for it ? How do we know you 're not possessed or something right now ? Come on . No , Leo , I 'm serious ! How do we know ? Because they have n't threatened anything we believe in ! It 's all good . We at least need to think about it . Since when did you jump on this Avatar train ? When I started thinking about what my kids ' lives would be like fighting the battles we 've been fighting our entire lives . But it 's what we do . It 's what we were born to do . That does not mean we have to die doing it . Yeah , maybe you should try to talk to Kyle , hear his side of the story . I do n't need to . I need to vanquish demons again . Something ... is not right ! Why would Malvoc attack only to retreat ? How would that help him get to the innocent ? Lose something ? What was that ? All part of the package . That was a lot of power . Yeah , but it 's used wisely . See , the Avatars could destroy us or force us to change , but they do n't . Is n't that enough reason to trust them ? How could you let him go ? How could you let the Avatar go ? Okay , he 's still Leo , so would you stop referring to him as " The Avatar , " please ? All right , we got ta fix this , and we got ta fix it fast . Now , where did he go ? I do n't know . He orbed out with Piper . But how do you know he did n't go to alert the others ? How are we supposed to stop them ? He did n't . I promise . Okay . Something is wrong . He 's not acting like himself . I think you need to orb that potion away from him before he does something stupid . What if he flips out ? I think he already has flipped out , Pai -- What did you do ? ! It 's just a tranq . She 'll be fine . What are you doing ? I 'm killing an Avatar , and nobody 's gon na stop me . He should wake up in a couple minutes . Thanks , Piper . For ? For believing in me . I always have . I always will . It 's the only way -- I know . Thanks for helping . What just happened ? We vanquished them ! No , we did n't . Yeah , we did . No , we vanquished the wrong ones . He had different markings . What do you mean ? We were tricked . You and I are gon na have a little chat . Let 's just take a deep breath here . We can talk this out . Leo ... I do n't want to hurt her , but I will if I have to . Your kind is responsible for a nightmare that wo n't go away , for all those nights waking up in a sweat begging that the flashbacks were just a dream . Kyle , please . It 's not a dream , though , is it , Leo ? You Avatars are as real as the air that we breathe and just as vacant . My parents were viciously murdered by them . So if I were you , Leo , I 'd do what I say . The Avatars could n't have killed your parents , Kyle . They believe in peace . I 'm gon na give you three seconds to summon one of your buddies here , so I can kill them . If you do n't , I 'm gon na kill you . Two ... Leo ! Three ! No ! Leo ? Piper , was n't supposed to happen like this . No , it 's okay . It 's okay . Not him , please . Leo ? Leo , come on . I do n't understand . How did this happen ? The potion is real , Leo . It kills Avatars . The Collective weakens with every last breath you take . We told you , the truth must come to them in their own time , not yours . But , Piper , she ... Understood , yes , but the others were not able to , and so we became the enemy out of fear and ignorance . And an innocent was lost because of it . Everything was lost . I was just trying to make things right with Piper . Of course . But you 've learned , and now you can save yourself . You have it in you to rewind time to just before you told Piper the truth , if you hurry . If we all hurry . As it is , we may not have enough to implement our plan . To rid the world of demons , to end the duality requires all that we had . But if the sisters come to the truth , wo n't their powers add to the collective ? Yes , but it may not be enough . You must not try this ever again , Leo . You can never tell Piper about us , not until she 's truly ready . Leo , please , this is not the time or place , okay ? I do n't want to get into this right now . This is a little dicey . Okay . Thank you . You 're distracted . Please , do n't tell me how to demon hunt . I 'm not . I did n't mean to . Let 's just focus on getting the demons . Not too much beetletoe . You do n't want to blow up the place , do you ? No . I guess I just realized I ca n't force things on you . If you 're gon na trust me , you 're gon na come to it in your own time . Hmm . There may be hope for you yet . Bottle up the potions . I think I know where the demons are gon na attack next . Now ! That was easy . Wait . All right . Now all we have to do is get rid of the other gang and we can bring the innocent back . All right , I give up . How did you figure all this out ? You do n't want to know , believe me . What ? Nothing . Just , uh , glad you gave me another shot , that 's all . You did n't think I would ? Well , I did n't hear from you after I botched breakfast . Well , breakfast is n't really a date anyway , right ? And dinner , much better . And dessert ? Dessert , too . Dessert is good ... Oh , you 're not so crazed . No ? Wait till I meet one . Forget that . Let 's , uh , rewind , and you can ask me the secrets question again , okay ? Do you , Kyle Brody , have any secrets ? No . They asleep ? Yeah . Finally . Piper ? Look , I know you think there 's something I have n't been telling you . Leo , not now . Just hear me out . There actually is something I 'm not telling you , but not because I do n't want to . It 's because I ca n't . What do you mean you ca n't ? The Elders wo n't let you ? Well , I ca n't even tell you that . I can tell you you 're gon na find out soon . You 're gon na be okay with it . Oh , yeah ? How do you know ? I know you .

And not touch me . Not touch you . Okay , great . Wait a minute ! Wait a minute ! What the hell are you talking about ? It 's just hard for me to sleep with touching . Me touching you ? Oh my God , Ray ! You know most husbands like cuddling with their wives . Nobody likes that ! Nobody ! The only time a guy likes cuddling is if he thinks it 's gon na lead to . to lower cuddling . I do n't believe it . When did this start ? When we started sleeping together . So you have n't said anything for nine years ? I would n't have said anything now . Have you slept down here before ? Just a couple of times . Look , I do n't have to do it anymore . I 'm happy just to suffer through it , that 's all . Suffer through it ? All right . Suffer might have been the wrong word . Look , the touching never use to bother me before ! It 's just . maybe it 's ' cause I 'm older . You know ? Things change . Like now I ca n't handle anything hickory . smoked . Do n't be mad ? Look , you wan na know something ? I 'll tell you the truth . This is my grandmother 's fault . Nonny Barone . Yes , of course , Nonny Barone , the woman who brought dysfunction to America . No , this is gon na sound dumb , but , every summer we had to visit her in Yonkers . She had this tiny apartment . Robert and I went to bed on the fold . out couch . All night long , he 'd be up against me . I could n't breathe . I was like , suffocating . I could n't do anything . I could n't say anything because he 'd wake up and then he 'd laugh and try to crush me . And if I screamed to stop him , Nonny Barone would come in and yell at me for the screaming . So , most nights I just lay there awake . That 's it . I do n't know . I 've never gotten over that . I 'll huddle , cuddle , hug , snug . Do it all because it 'll be good for me . Oh , that 's . no . It 's okay . I mean , I did n't know that , so ... I 'll try to give you some more room , okay . Hey , jambalaya ! Mm . hm . Coffee . Nope , no coffee . I drank it all . I am very tired . Really . Mm . Eh . Where are you going . Across the street to get some coffee . Oh sure , have your mother think I 'm so terrible I ca n't even give my husband his morning coffee . Aw , come on . She thinks that already . Oh hi , Robert . Hey , is Ally here ? No , she went to school . But she was suppose to take me for show and tell . Today 's things that begin with " P " . Oh , police officer . Hey , Deb , you okay ? No , I could n't get comfortable sleeping last night . And you know what ? It 's all your fault . That 's right . How come you had to torture Ray at Nonny Barone 's . What do you mean . You know , when you were kids and you slept on the pull . out couch together . We never slept on a pull . out couch together . Yes , you did . At Nonny Barone 's little apartment in Yonkers . Apartment ? She had a nice house . We each had our own room . Oh , those were happy times . Okay ! Got some coffee and ... bag of Mom 's homemade jelly doughnuts . Liar ! Nonny Barone , the apartment , the pull . out sofa bed . You never slept with Robert , did you , Ray ? ! It was all a lie ! You liar ! lt was n't a lie ! Oh , Robert told me ! Okay , it was a lie ! Why did you lie to me ? ! I did n't want you to feel bad about me not wanting to touch you ! You do n't want Debra to touch you . Do you mind ? That 's right , Robert ! My husband does n't want me to touch him ! Only in bed ! I , um . I 'm late for show and tell . Yeah and I am nuts for wanting to cuddle with you or be anywhere near you in the first place . You need some help ! Honey , please . No , no . Look , I just . I ca n't sleep with you on me .

Try to imagine that you are Debra . I need new shoes ! As Debra ... what is happening in your life that makes you want to cling to your husband in bed ? Hold on , when I tap myself on this side it sounds much more muffled than this side . Open your eyes , Raymond . Open them , open them ! Sorry , sorry . Hey , where 's my wallet ? Kidding ! Raymond . Maybe Debra 's missing a sense of intimacy . She may not feel close to you during the day , so she seeks out that closeness at night . That makes sense . What do you mean ? Do you touch her during the day ? Do you kiss her ? Stroke her hair ? Hold her hand ? Okay . See , we 're married . You need to show your loved ones how much you care .

@@5262041 And trust . All right , very nice , people . Now that you have clearly mastered the trust exercise , you , you 're ready to act . But the secret to acting is reacting . Did you see that ? He reacted . - He did n't think . Did you ? - I try not to , sir . And you 're great at it . I want you all living in that mom ... I 've got a brother . You 're gon na have to do way better than that . Oh . Hmm ... Nice work . You get an A for the day . I 'll take a B if you stop doing that . Everybody listen up . Now we 're going to do the mirror exercise . What one does , the other mirrors . Acting , reacting . Mirror . Now , next week , we are doing scenes from Shakespeare 's great play , Romeo and Juliet . " But soft , what light through yonder window breaks ? " It is the east , and Juliet is the sun . I mean , look at him . I know , he 's always monkeying around . - Exactly , and I need a good grade . - So do I . But if one of us does n't pick him , nobody will . I guess you 're right . So ... - You pick him . - Me ? No way ! Nice mirror . I have a compromise . I pick Henry ! No fair ! He went to Shakespeare Camp three summers in a row ! - Why do you think I picked him ? - You know what ? I do n't care . This does n't mean I pick Oliver . You pick Oliver ? Bold choice ! Especially considering you 're going to have to kiss him . I knew I 'd get you ! Just kidding ! Comeon ! Oliver , we have been rehearsing for over two hours and we 're still on the first page ! It did n't take Shakespeare this long to write the play ! Okay , just give me a second to get into character . Why me ? Hey , Juliet ! Get it ? I 'm a fruit fly ! Huh , fruit fly ? Now you 're a dead fruit fly . Can we just please do this , Oliver , please ? Okay . I 'll really try this time . But soft , what light over yonder breaks wind ? No ! You know what , I 'm just gon na email Mr . Corelli and ask for another partner . Miley , wait . Hey , guess what , done that . At least when I joke around , they 're laughing because I want them to . Come on , Oliver , nobody 's gon na laugh at you . Trust me , this has been going on forever . Four score and ... I 'm a fruit fly ! Abraham fruit fly ! Okay , look , Oliver , everybody gets nervous . When I 'm up there as Hannah Montana , I get nervous , too . - Oh , yeah , right . - No , really . The minute I hear I have to perform , I get a huge knot in my stomach and my heart starts pounding so hard I can hardly move . Guess who 's singing the National Anthem at the Laker game tomorrow night ? Yes ! Hannah Montana ! Rocking the anthem ! For the Lakers ! But I 'm very nervous , huge knot , do n't know if I can do it . - Nice try . - Okay , so I do n't get nervous . Wow . Romeo and Juliet . I had to do this scene in speech class . - And you did just fine , did n't you ? - Nope . Actually , it was the darkest day of my life . Made it through the first two words then froze up like Aunt Pearl in the outhouse on Christmas morning . - But everything turned out okay ? - Only ' cause I started cracking jokes . " What light through yonder window breaks wind ? " That one killed them ! But that was wrong . Shakespeare is very important and you 'll use it every day of your life . Like fractions . I 'm using them right now . I 'm halfway out the room . Three-quarters and I 'm gone . See ? I 'm not the only one who has a problem with Shakespeare . Even your dad got all freaked out . Oliver , but he did n't have me . You 're my friend . And I 'm not gon na let you fall on your face . - Hey , Rico . How 's it going ? - Great , fine , swell . Now give me my box . Where 's my secret candy box ? Where is it ? What happened ? What did you do ? It 's gone ! Yeah , along with the enamel on your teeth . Look , your dad called . Your last dental exam was so bad , they 're putting your x-rays up in the lobby to scare the other kids . The man lies ! Last time we went to the movies , he put me in a diaper so I could get in for free . I 'm not buying it . This is the same father who gave me 100 bucks to keep this away from you . Give me , give me , give me , give me , give me , give me ... Please , settle down , all right ? You see what this candy is doing to you ? This is for your own good . Fine . Oh , yeah ? Well , what about right here ? Give me , give me , give me , no , give me , give me . - And here . - Give me , give me , give me ... Hey , Dad , how you doing ? What 's for dinner ? Hope it 's meatloaf . How was your day ? Mine was good . Nice shirt , goes with your hair . What 's for dinner ? Did I already ask that ? Meatloaf ? Jackson , how much candy have you had today ? Why would you even ask that ? We both know you have a problem when you 've had too much sweets . Let it go . I was eight , it was Easter , I 'd never seen a chocolate bunny before . Big chocolate bunny ears with candy eyes . Whoa ! Okay , let me smell your breath . I can stop anytime I want . - Hey , what are you eating ? - Nothing ! Get off my back , woman ! Daddy , I have n't seen him like this since Halloween of ' 99 . Oh , I remember . I clocked him at 58 miles an hour in his roller-skates . In a Yoda costume . So , how 's it going with Romeo ? Well , you know , I finally got Oliver to take it seriously and guess what ? He 's seriously horrible . I just think you guys need to take a break . We 'll go to the Laker game , you 'll sing the anthem , get your mind off of it . I wish . But all I can think about is getting a bad grade and looking stupid , - just because I 'm stuck with Oliver . - Mile , Oliver is ... I know , he 's a friend and you do n't bail on friends . - Yeah , Mile , but ... Mile , iceberg right behind you . You said you 'd be there for me . - Oliver , I was just ... - Bailing on me ? No , I was just thinking about bailing on you . - It 's different ! - You said I was the Titanic . Not the ship ! The very successful movie ! You made like $ 1 billion ! Okay , Daddy , we need a new warning signal . Honey , I did everything but baste you with barbeque sauce . I should not feel bad about this . It 's not my fault that Shakespeare makes him nervous . " What light through yonder window breaks ? " How tough is that ? Ladies and gentlemen , please rise for the singing of our National Anthem by teen pop sensation , Hannah Montana . Osay , can_you see by the dawn 's early light through yonder window breaks ... Or ramparts ... No , rockets . Red glare ... Oh , yeah , right . You get it ? Jackson , you want some pancakes with that syrup ? No thanks . I 'm good . Jumping Jehoshaphat , Son ! Next time , do n't waste a plate . - Just drink it from the bottle . - That 's a great idea ! Jackson ! Whoo ! That really worked . Thanks , Dad ! - Sweet . - It 's good . Hey , Mr . Stewart , how 's Miley ? Well , it 's noon and she 's still holed up in her room , if that tells you anything . Hey , bud . How you doing ? Okay . Except I had this awful dream where I forgot the National Anthem in front of thousands of people . That was n't a dream . You could n't play along for like a minute ? Oh , sorry , let 's not think about it anymore . Let 's watch some TV . Get your mind off of it . Everyone is talking about Hannah Montana 's massive mistake . Through yonder window breaks ... And I 'm not changing his name now , that would just confuse him . - Here you go , Mile . - I 'm too upset to eat . I 'm not . Well , listen , after tonight , when Hannah performs on Top Rockers , nobody 's even gon na remember she screwed up the National Anthem . - What ? - Top Rockers . I love that show ! Made the call this morning . It 's all set . Daddy , I ca n't perform on Top Rockers , that 's a live show . What if I mess up again ? Miley , what 's going on ? You 've never had stage fright before . These are very good . What did you do to them ? I mean , I have never had people laughing at me before . Mile , that 's not gon na happen again . Uncle Earl forgot the words to the National Anthem ? No , Uncle Earl fell off a horse . Took four of us to get that fat , old coot back up there . I just do n't wan na get laughed at again . Wow . And that 's exactly how Oliver feels . And you bailed on him . Ironic , is n't it ? Just stop your flapping and eat your flapjacks . Mile , everybody gets nervous . But the longer you wait , the tougher it 's gon na get . I guess you 're right . I just got ta do this , do n't I ? But what if I forget the words to one of my songs ? Or I forget to put my costume on ? Then I 'd be singing in my underwear . That 'd be quite a show . Stupid selfish bees ! How much honey do you need ? Come on , Oliver . - Oh , you mean like she did to me ? - But she knows how you feel now . Leonardo DiCaprio threw a foam finger at her . Has n't she suffered enough ? Let me think . No . Oliver ! Oh , here we are in Happy Bunnyland , Tokyo . Oh , no , what 's that ? It 's Jack-zilla ! Run for your bunny lives ! What are you looking at ? Jackson , you have to stop . You 're hopping down a bunny trail of no return . You do n't know what you 're talking about . Of course I do . I was like you once . But I 'm a veggie man now . I even worked out this morning .

Lola , I ca n't remember anything . What am I gon na do ? Do n't worry , I got your back . Oh , cue cards . Great idea . - What if I forget how to read ? - Get a grip . This is the life , hold on tight . This is the dream , it 's all you need . Hey , you 're right . You know , that 's great advice . What advice ? Those are the lyrics to your song . Of course they are ! I 'm not nervous . I 'm good . - Places , Miss Montana . - Help me ! I will . Just remember , keep your eyes on me . Right . What song is that from ? That 's not a song , that was the advice ! - Or maybe he came to laugh at me . Could be . Either way , good luck . Four , three , two ... And now , live and acoustic , Top Rockers is proud to present ! Give it up for Hannah Montana ! Take the world , shake and stir And that 's what I got going on I throw my cares up in the air And I do n't think they 're coming down Yeah , I love how it feels right now Still loving how it feels right now Down in front !

You know , I had a rough patch at the beginning of the show and an even rougher patch earlier this week . But I learned something that I should 've known all along . Good friends do n't bail on you . And they 're always there to catch you if you fall . We love you , Hannah ! - I love you , too ! I love you all ! Thank you everybody . Good night . I love you , Jackson . That 's right . I 'm talking to you , big boy . You 're not real . Can I have a bite of that , big boy ? I do n't think I can do this . Okay . - I 'm positive I ca n't do this . - Yes , you can . You were there for me and I 'm gon na be there for you . I love the energy I 've seen today , I love the passion . But most of all I love that we 're almost done .

You really , really hate me . - Hi , Larry . - Hey , Heidi . So , how 's your brother ? I have n't spoken to him since we broke up . You big lucky . Maybe I should break up with him . You 're funny . Mike 's not funny at all . Neither is your dad . Am I crazy , or is my brother 's ex-girlfriend flirting with me ? I better put a stop to this . So you want to go out sometime ? Like I 'm gon na get Hillary a car . Give me a break . Well , if you do I 'd have her sign one of those car contracts ... just take the car away . Yeah . Those contracts could save a kid 's life . Yeah . And more importantly , for the price of a used car I could pretty much own her ass . Ha ... Joe , you 're brilliant . Where 'd you come up with that one ? They talked about it for two hours last week at that seminar on teenage insurance . Nah , I must 've missed that . You sat next to me . You do n't know what you 're talking about . Jennifer with the curly hair and hot body gave the presentation . Oh , that was a good meeting . And she has to maintain B average or we take the car away . Good one , yeah . Oh , and if she misses curfew and comes in a minute past 12:30 , we take the car away . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Why 12:30 ? We 're rewriting the rules . New curfew : 11:30 . Oh , well , in that case I say we add a no-Charlie clause . Huh ? Sorry , Charlie . Now all we have to do is find her a cheap , safe used car that we can take away from her . Yeah . Hey , my Mom mentioned that she wants to sell her car . I already took her daughter off her hands . When does it end ? The War at Home : Episode 4 Psst . Dad . Dad . I need to have a man-to-man talk . All right , well , wake me up when the other man gets here . I-I-I asked out Mike 's ex-girlfriend and I feel really guilty about it . Good . You should . You ca n't go out with your brother 's ex . That 's guy code . It 's bros before hos . But Heidi 's not a ho . I 'm pretty sure that 's the reason Mike broke up with her in tirst place . Okay , you do n't want to piss each other off , you know . Because then resentments build up , and one day you 're at your brother 's wedding and you 're giving a drunken toast and you think you 're being funny , but you 're actually calling your brother 's new wife a fat cow . But I really like Heidi . Larry , if there 's one thing I know about it 's how to ruin a relationship with a brother . All right , if you do n't believe me , ask your Uncle Eric . I have Uncle Eric ? Larry , I know what I 'm talking about , all right , but if you want another opinion ask your mother . Vicky . You awake ? If I let him know I 'm awake , he 'll want to have sex . Oh , crap , now I have to pee . Man , she 's a sound sleeper . Whoa , whoa , whoa . You would let me finish . Look , you ca n't go out with her unless you ask Mike . All right , if he 's okay with it , fine . But if not then leave her alone . Okay . I can do that . Thanks , Dad . Anytime . And by " anytime " I mean before 10:00 p.m . during the week , 6:00 p.m . on Saturday and never on Sunday . All right , Betty , so , uh ... how much you want for it ? Dave , I do n't know anything about cars . I ... we 're family . Just make me a fair offer . Okay . How about 2500 . How about you shove it up your  ? I mean , that 's not even close to Blue Book . 4800 , not a penny less . No way . Forget it , no deal . Plus , I 've got to get rid of it . I was involved in a small hit-and-last week . Ok . All right . $3,500 , but that 's my final offer . Fine . But we say that the car is from both of us . And tell Vicky when I come over for dinner , she ca n't make that eggplant Parmesan anymore . Unless she 's trying to kill me . Fine . Okay . Deal . And just for the record , Dave , it 's not about the money . I just want my granddaughter to be happy . Aww . Cash , right ? F-Funny story Mike , so I ran into your ex-girlfriend , Heidi , and I asked her out and she said yes . - F-Funny story , all right ? - Why are you telling me ? I do n't care . Oh , okay . Great , thanks , Mike . Thanks a lot . What ? W-What 's so funny ? Nothing . No , no , no . I mean , she maybe needs citizenship or kidney . Maybe she is going out with me cause I 'm the funny brother and you 're funny at all . You 'll see . It has nothing to do with you . So , thaa-da ! Yeah , if I were you , I 'd say thaa-da for the first time she sees you with your pants off . It wo n't help the disapointment , but at least she 'll still think you 're funny , right ? What 's so important ? Sweetie , ask me for a car . No we 've play these game before , Daddy . " Ask me for a car . " " Can I have a car ? " " No . " It 's not funny , it 's just cruel . Oh , come on , sweetie - - this time , it 'll be different , I promise . Go ahead , ask me . I 'm just kidding you , sweetie . Look , we decided to give you your grandmother 's old car . It 's true . Oh , my God . Thank you , Grandma ! Oh , sweetie . There 's nothing I would n't do for my granddaughter . No , no , sweetie , the car is from all of us . And by all of us , I mean mostly me . Thanks , guys . You 're welcome . Bup , bup , bup , bup , bup , bup , bup . Not so fast . There 's one condition . Okay , I 'm bored . I 'll go and see about dinner . What are we having , anyway ? Eggplant Parmesan . Yum . What is it ? Ask me anything , just name it . Okay , if you want the car , you have to sign this . What 's that ? A car contract . It 's things that you 'll agree to do if you want to keep the car . Bup , bup , bup , bup , bup , bup , bup ... What ? You 're in violation of the contract . What do you mean ? I have n't even gotten in the car yet . Yeah , it says very explicitly that we have final wardrobe approval , and that 's not a skirt , sweetie . That 's an invitation . Which brings us to safety . Seat belts and underwear must be worn at all times . I w ... uh , running errands ? Mm-hmm . Carpooling - - this is ridiculous . Sorry , it 's my way or no highway . Wait . Sweetie , I-I forgot to tell you , we also - - we got you your own gas credit card . Really ? Hell , no . Wow , Lifetime Achievement Award . But I 'm still so young . This is great . Mike is so wrong . Heidi totally likes me . And quite frankly , what 's not to like ? I rock . Hey , hey , h-hey , Heidi-ho ... Forget about him . Let 's just keep watching the movie , okay , Mike ? I mean ... Larry . God , I 'm sorry . It 's okay , um , e-everyone makes mistakes , right ? Does n't mean anything . Oh , my God , Mike 's right . Heidi does n't like me . And quite frankly , what 's to like ? I suck . Okay , maybe I 'm wrong . Or maybe she 's just kissing me so that I think I 'm wrong . Oh , who cares ? I have more than one tongue in my mouth . Bye-bye , see you later . Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh . What ? M-My homework 's done , I deleted Pothead Charlie from my buddy list , and I 'm dressed like a Hasidic girl . I 'm good to go , right ? Yeah , you 're good to go ... to the dentist to pick up your little brother . Fine . Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup ... Ah ... House of Hunan took forever , and they were out of soda so I had to go to the supermarket ; and there 's horrible construction on Glencove Road , but ... it 's here ... And still hot . Where are the egg rolls ? I guess they forgot them .  ... I 'll go back . Is n't this car contract thing amazing ? You were right . It 's like we have complete control over her . Yeah , yeah , yeah , she 's the first Jewish slave in over 6,000 years and she works for us . We are great parents . Oh , look . The egg rolls are here . So , Larry , who 's next on your list of inappropriate dates ? I 'm sure Dad probably has some ex-girlfriends . Maybe they 're available . You know what ? Neither did you , you liar . Yeah , that 's right , I 'm lying ... lying down with your ex-girlfriend . Seriously , shut up . You shut up . Hey , you both shut up . Yeah , and stop fighting , you two . This is what I was afraid of , okay ? Now , you figure out a way to settle this yourself or I 'm going to settle it for you . All right . Okay , geez . Now , who wants some fried rice ? You know what ? I do n't want fried rice , because I have a girlfriend who really likes me , so I do n't want fried rice . I bet if I made out with the fried rice first , then you 'd want some . And for all we know , Heidi could be Larry 's last girlfriend , so you lay off . Ha-ha ! Hey , wait , what ? Vicky ? Vicky ? Vicky ! Aah ! What ? I 'm not having sex . No , no , I-I ca n't sleep . It 's this Mike and Larry thing . You know , every time those two go at it , it reminds me that , uh , you know , maybe I 'm not any better at this than my father was . That 's not true . He would have drank a fifth of scotch and passed out watching The Tonight Show . You 're up and you 're worrying about them . That 's progress . Good night . Dave , are we going to talk about this all night long ? No , it 's just sometimes , I start to think about the past a-and I get a little sad ... Hey , you want to have sex ? Sure . Okay . All right , I 'm going to the mall with Brenda . I 'll see you later . Oh , good , I 'm sure your grandmother will enjoy seeing her . What ? Yeah , you got to drive Grandma Betty to the podiatrist . Anything else ? No . No . Oh , you know , just wait there a couple of hours while they scrape off her bunions . No . Excuse me ? I said no . No ? Well , then , I guess we could always rip up that car contract . Good , do it . Then we 're just going to have to take away the car . Fine . I ca n't take this anymore . I 'm out . But ... you love that car . Yeah , and what about driving all your friends around and being the cool girl with her own car ? What about Grandma 's bunions ? You can scrape them off yourself , for all I care . I am done . I 'm going to go now , but I 'll be sure to tell Pothead Charlie you guys said hello . Bye . Okay , Hillary , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , honey . Come on . Sweetheart ... I 'm sure we can work something out . Sweetie , come on , I 'm sure we can come to some sort of compromise . Come on , honey . You 're right . Let 's , let 's compromise . Yeah , let 's come to some compromise . First ... curfew . 11:30 ? Not going to work for me . All right , okay . All right , Hillary , y-you know what ? You know , let 's just forget about compromising and forget about this , you know , silly little contract . And you know what else you should forget about ? What ? Ever driving that car again . You 're done . Wait a minute , um , midnight curfew could work . No , no , no , no , no , it 's too late , You 're bossing us around . I 'm the bup-bup-bup guy , not you . Oh , gosh ! Good going , Moses , you just freed our only slave . Hey , um , you know what would be fun ? Uh , w-why do n't we ask each other questions ? You know , to get to know each other better , like " What 's your favorite color ? " that kind of thing . Okay . Now , my turn . Are you going out with me just to make my brother jealous so you can get him back ? What ? Uh ... there 's no wrong answer , it 's just for fun . No , I 'm not . Really ? Yes , really , I have no interest in ever going out with Mike again - - ugh ! Yes ! Hey , Mike , you get down here ! I was right . Heidi said that she was n't going out with me to get you back . She was going out with me because she likes me . In your face ! Go ahead , Heidi , tell him . Uh , Larry , you did n't let me finish . Uh-oh . I 'm not interested in you anymore either . I mean , you were really funny that time at the pizza place , but lately , you just seem , I do n't know , paranoid . Paranoid ? Now that 's ridiculous . I 'm going to leave now . See you at school . Loser . Y-You 're the loser . And you know what ? Heidi was my girlfriend ... All right , all right , that 's it . That 's it , stop it ! Okay ? I-I tried to stay out of this , b-b-but I ca n't . Okay , you guys do n't give me any choice . Y-y-you 're , you 're both out of the Heidi business . You ca n't date her and you ca n't date her . All right , you 're done , I shut you down . Dad , she already ... No , I do n't care . That girl is bad news . Okay , she has an itch for the men in this family and we have to cut her off before she moves on to me , comprende ? All right , all right , fine . Okay . And another thing . On the other hand , if you end up close with a great relationship , you 're welcome . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have a fifth of scotch to drink . Do you think that we should tell him that Heidi dumped the both of us , or let him think he helped ? I mean , I say we get out of here before he notices the fifth of scotch is missing . So , what do you want for it ? Well , I do n't know , since I , uh , gave you $3,500 for it on Wednesday , I was thinking , I do n't know , 3,500 ? For this old heap ? I 'll give you 1,500 . What ? are you crazy ? Hey , everybody knows a car loses half its value the minute it 's driven off the lot . What lot , Betty ? Th-This is my driveway . Fine , in the interest of family harmony , I 'll give you 2,000 ... in installments . You know , I have to eat that crap , too . All right , you win , I 'll pay full price . Thank you . But ... I noticed some strange new scratches up front . You 're going to have to give it a whole new paint job . That ought to keep the fuzz off my tail for a while .

Residential-industrial spaceport on Earth ! I have many questions and little time . Who is in charge here ? I must speak with your king . - So , Jack ... - You do n't see Aku . Aku sees you ! - Aku ? - Yeah , man ! Aku . The master of masters . - The deliverer of darkness . - The shogun of sorrow . - No ! How can this be ? - Do n't know . Just always been that way . This ... I ... Yo , Jack . What 's up ? You do n't look so good . What Jack needs is some liquid refreshment . - Perhaps you are right . - Word ! Right over there . - They will hook you up . - Word ! - What ? - Hey , man ! Jack just want a drink ! A drink ? Why did n't you say so ? And what you looking at ? I apologize . I am new here . I did not mean to stare . No , human . It is not that easy ! Please . I again apologize for my misbehavior . I do not wish for any more trouble . - Get up . - I wish you no harm . It is not me who should worry about being hurt , human . It is you ! So , what do you say , old chap ? Will you help us ? So , what did he say ? What did he say ? Will he do it ? He said you 're out of your mind , you blasted idiot ! What do we do now ? We 've asked just about everyone here . I say ! - Yes , that 's the one . I like him . - By Jove , he 's good ! - Aye . But it ai n't over . Lads , that 's our boy . Aye , he 's good , all right . But he 'll never do it . We 'll see about that . Be careful , Rothchild . No worries , old friend . Everything is under control . Pardon me , fine sir . Down here , old fellow . I was just wondering if you would be so kind as to join us , as we are ... - Talking demon dogs ! - Good heavens ! Where ? You will not best me this day , vile henchman of Aku ! Hold on a moment , sir ! I am by no means a demon or have anything to do with Aku . - But you speak in the language of man . - But of course ! Splendid . Right this way . - Your refreshments are here . - Splendid . My boy , I do apologize . How rude of us . We have n't introduced ourselves . This is Sir Dreyfuss Alexander , chief of excavation . Dreyfuss , old boy , you 're drooling again . Oh , oh , sorry . You blasted idiot ! You 're getting everybody wet ! And this fine gentleman is Angus McDuffy , artifact aficionado . And I am Sir Colin Bartholomew Montgomery Rothchild III . Or " Rothie , " for short . I am sorry . I am very confused . Your world is new to me . What has happened ? No , no , no . Quite all right , quite all right . Since the beginning of history , the immortal Aku has ruthlessly ruled the Earth plundering its resources as he sees fit . But it was still not enough . He opened his ports to the galaxy so that he might take the riches of other worlds as well . There are other worlds across the stars ? Well , of course , silly . What world do you hail from ? But I am from Earth . Yet this world is nothing like the world I remember . - How so , lad ? - Even the grandest cities were never as overwhelming as this one . Chariots did not fly , and dogs did not speak in human tongue . What do you mean ? Well , I mean no insult . They were wonderful companions but the dogs I knew merely barked . You see ? The ancient myths are true ! impossible ! If what you say is true , he 'd have to be thousands of years old . Astounding ! The age-o-meter dates your particles all the way back to 25 B.A . Twenty-five years before Aku enslaved the Earth . You , my friend , are a living fossil . So the question is not where I am but when I am . Time warp is highly plausible . Allowing his evil time to fester and infect the entire world . Most undoubtedly . And I 'm sure he plans to spread his vileness through the stars . No . I must return to my own time so that I might undo Aku 's evil reign before it envelops the Earth . This ageless demon must be stopped . Oh , I 'm so glad we agree on that point which actually brings us back to our proposal . You see , we are archeologists trying to dig up the remains of our ancestors to find out more about our past . It was only a few years ago that we discovered that our ancestors walked upon their legs and their arms . Then , one day , during our excavation , we actually stumbled upon rare jewels . Aye . These jewels ended up being a key source of power for Aku . And we can escape in secret to again continue to discover our history . I will help you . Splendid ! Well , we 're off , then . - Hold it ! - What is it now , Rothie ? - What 's wrong ? - My dearest apologies , kind sir . But we never got your name . - Jack . - Jack was all ... - Jack . Jack . - Yo , Jack . - Jack , was ... - Jack ! They call me Jack . Jack ? I say , that 's nice . So simple but it seems to fit . Who am I to comment ? Well , Jack , we 're on our way . We 'll take our rocket ship . Rocket ship ? I 'm taking a break . My lord , we are the Vadaquas from the Mosconian Galaxy . Our water planet has been pillaged . And your world is our last hope for survival . I know of your plight , Vadaquian . For you see , I am he who has taken your waters and the riches within them . - You monster ! - Be quiet ! I am sorry , my lord . The boy is young and foolish . He does not know what he says . The boy will return . He will learn proper respect for Aku in the pit of hate . Yes , oh , master . Your wisdom is unquestionable . But will you , great lord Aku , allow us to inhabit your world ? For you are our only hope . You will be allowed . The oceans of Aku will be your new home . But you will pay homage to me by constructing statues in my likeness . Once a month , a monolithic tribute will rise from the depths of the ocean to remind all who is the master of this world . Now be gone ! He has vowed to liberate the canines from your mines . What impertinence is this ? Show me the fool ! So fate has arrived . Many years have gone since that day . And now , my formidable foe , you will pay for my pain in the past with your pain in the future . Oh , dear . Sir Jack , are you ill ? I 'm fine . I just prefer walking . Yes . Rocket rides . Sorry about that , old-timer . But anyway , welcome to our camp . As you can see , our archaeological dig had unearthed many astounding discoveries concerning the history of canine kind . But unfortunately , Aku has , shall we say redirected our efforts purely toward the excavation of his precious gems . And if Aku 's unreasonable quotas are not fully met I 'm afraid terrible punishments are exacted . My people 's spirits are broken . But no more . Even dogs should not be forced to live like dogs ! They 're coming ! They 're coming ! Aku 's drones approach from the south . They will be upon us by sunrise . 
@@5262441 1x08 ' Teddy takes off ' I 'm a fully heterosexual guy , let me be clear . But when you work in two square feet of space with the same guy for a long enough time , your relationship takes on a ballet-like quality . I 've worked with Teddy on and off for over ten years . Not only is he the best fish guy in the business , but he breaks me up . Hey , Teddy ! I heard you and Jim 's mom have been going out pretty hard . Last night , Jim 's mom and I had a really romantic dinner , and when I walked her home , we kissed . Very so tenderly . - That 's so hot ! But we were soon so overcome with passion , that we jumped to Connecticut and checked in to a B and B . Let 's just say that Teddy had a little muffin before breakfast . He is the fish guy . You may think talking smack about a guy 's mom is over the line , but when you work in a kitchen , there is no line . You promise to call me this time ? - I promise I 'll try . Thanks for the lender , Iqbal Each time you get it closer . Doctor Goldfarb is doing surgery in ten minutes I 'm sorry , mate . How can I make it up to you ? Just make sure I have my dinner at 5 PM . There is Crusted yellowfin Tuna . - Again ? That 's every night for the last two months . I mean , it 's an amazing dish , but my God , Iqbal , that 's not right . Look , the rest of my life is a washing chaos . I need a constant . We made it into " Food and Wine " . " Nolitas 's signature sassily Crusted yellowfin with morels and beluga caviar does more than demonstrate Bourdain 's brilliance , it sets a new standard in talent in haute cuisine " . Oh , my God ! The yellowfin is my recipe . I developed it three years ago *** Well I was supervising you as head chef . You were supervising ... ? You were supervising me ? You were in the walking the whole time playing high the fish stick with the owner 's wife ! It sounds like they 're yelling . Good ear . So all of a sudden it 's your recipe because it 's in here . No , it 's my recipe because it 's in here . Allright , because you 're all knowing all powerful . I 'm surprised you 're not taking credit for creating tuna itself . Hey , no one is saying that you did n't make a valuable contribution to this dish . Right , but no-one is saying that I did . Look , look . I think someone needs to take a little ego check . And here it comes . You know what ? I 'm out of here ! - Okay , good bye , little baby ! Baby finds a new crib . And dipers . It 's like he 's not even here anymore . Oh , no , no , no . There , there . Steven , how many times has Steven quit ? I believe this one makes 17 . - 17 times , and every time , the same story . Teddy 's sensitive ego gets bruised somehow , At Jack 's expense . - You are a rockstar now ? Yeah , I am a rockstar , and you 're my drummer , so just shut up and just bang your little drums , okay ? I am outtahere ! Teddy takes off and hooks up with an old buddy who always makes him feel better about himself . Goes home and works through his anger . What ? You do n't tell me how to cook . You know you do n't tell me how to cook . I tell you how to cook . That 's right , I tell you how to cook ! You got that ? Shut up ! There . You feel better now ? Yes . - Big hug ? Come on . Come on . Are you smelling me ? Not on purpose . What ? I get one moment of glory and Teddy 's got ta make it all about him ? Absolutely terrible human being . Listen , since we 're back to the five , who preps the shrimp ? I mean , I 'd do it myself . I just feel like it 's beneath me . I mean , who built this place ? Who brought all you guys together ? I mean , seriously , screw him ! I 'm in " Food and Wine " magazine . Very handsome . So who does the choppy choppy peely peely ? What 's that ? - The shrimp . Hey , guys , this is Chet . He 's going to be managing the fish station from now on . Hey ! I am just so excited to be here , really . I just , uh ... Exquise me ! You ca n't hire him , that 's not the way it works . This is the way it works now . I do n't have time for Teddy 's tantrums anymore . Of course you do . It 's your bit , it 's your thing . " I am mad at you " . " No , I am mad at you . " " I feel one way " . " No , I feel another " . Extreme reaction . Oh , hasty action . Yeah . No , Nolita is my last chance and I 'm not going to let it be sabotaged by Teddy 's gigantic ego . Teddy 's ego ? Okay . I like Chet . He 's not a pre-madonna . Even though he was twice named the shrimp king of the upper west side . I see , it 's all about titles now . That one . ***  Nice . There 's a new guy ? What new guy ? Hey ! I am not the fish ! Yes ? Jack . - My name is Ricky Rifkin . I have a chef named Teddy Wang in my kitchen . I 'd like ... Yeah , I understand he 's left your establishment . I 'd sure like to snatch him up before the rest of New York finds out he 's available . Really ? He says I 'd ask you for your recommendation . You wan na know about Teddy ? He said you are amazing . What ? He said there 's no-one that even approaches your level of talent . He said I 'd be a fool not to hire you . Vindictive bastard . This is how it starts . First the hubris , then the women , then the drugs . I 'm sorry . What did you say ? I said I 'm in . It 's catchy . So , this is the old guy 's means . Make it your won , ' cause he 's never coming back . It 's Chet 's place now . - Great . I guess I 'll just get started prepping the yellowfin tuna . Oh , actually I am doing the tuna . I thought I was the fish guy . You are . But it 's my signature dish . It got me into the " Food and Wine " magazine . Let me show you the picture . Let me see , here 's the picture . Yeah , look at that . Ai n't that something ? Where 's the recipe ? Ca n't make it without the recipe . Well , you can . It 's yours . I know , I know . Just *** Yes , sir . The camera really loves you . I know , right ? It 's crazy . Talk to Jack . - Why should I talk to Jack about it ? Because he listens to you . Teddy 's my girlfriend . I miss him . I miss my girlfriend . Are you happy now ? Yes ! And you 're right . I ca n't afford another dallier in the kitchen . We 've got so much to beat up on the student and that time deserves for Jim . Exquise me . Pratt ! He leaves these things everywhere . It 's time we ask ourselves one question : What would Sinatra do ? He 'd take off that sodding bandana . Word to the wise : get out now . Why would I do that ? - We torture the new guy . I am serious . It is shockingly cruel . We got a real vietcom thing going on here . You savvy , Chet ? - Okay . Look , they like to give the new guys static . Do n't let it break you down . I am in Jack Bourdain 's kitchen . There is nothing that can break me down . Your attitude determines your altitude , my friend . He forked me ! It hurts so extremely much ! Look , you 're on your own . I 'm good ! I 'm good . *** Et voil ? ! Crusted yellowfin tuna . Picture perfect , mate . I can do Teddy 's job . - I 'm sure you believe that . I can do anybody 's job . - I would n't go that far . Sauce . Needs sauce . You want tuna , you got tuna . Oh , no . You do n't . What 's the matter , mate ? - This is crap ! What ? This is not Ferrari fish . This is a mini-van fish ! No , listen . This girl 's a *** high genus . She 's not going to do it in a mini-van . What ? What are you doing in these cars ? Iqbal , come on ! - No , no , you come on ! Until I get my proper fish you are *** . No cars ! We have to get Teddy back . Put everybody on to the lamb provenzal . What 's wrong with the tuna ? What ? Nothing . The tuna is perfect . I 'm just really excited about my lamb . Your lamb ? My lamb . - Whatever . This lamb is you lamb , this lamb is my lamb . This lamb was made for you and me ! Yeah , exactly . So what 's everybody going to be ordering tonight ? I 'll have the yellowfin tuna . Yellowfin tuna . Do n't bother with the menus . We all want the magazine fish . How much did you spend on this ? Ten grand ? Ten , twelve , who 's counting ?

Oh , my God . Have I taken credit for another man 's fish ? Great . You 're gon na call Teddy , you 're gon na call him now , and you 're gon na get him back . End of story . If I may say one thing . - It better not be " exquise me " ! I do n't think Jack Bourdain makes this call . I think Jack Bourdain steps up and has the courage to break the toxic patterns of his past . I think Jack Bourdain says good bye to people who do n't want him to shine . You 're all right , Chet . Hey , everybody ! Hey , listen up ! You should be like Chet . Chet . Jack Bourdain ! Come on . That 's enough . I ca n't breath ! Okay ! April fools . I 'm dying ! You know it 'll be you next week . Yeah . - Yeah . You realise this is not in good fun , right ? Screw you ! You ca n't break me ! They did this to me at the Foster Home and it just made me stronger ! We want Teddy back . We want you gone . You know what Sinatra did when he wanted somebody gone ? Bring it ! All of you bring it ! It 's amazing ! What do you call that ? Teddy 's crusted yellowfin tuna . By me , Teddy . You 're very talented . - And very Asian . We find that incredibly hot . Well , to be fair , my parents were Asian . So yeah ? - Oh , yeah . Wait , you mean as in a ... ? Yo , Teddy , phone ! Hello ? - Hey , it 's me . Well , this is a good one , huh ? Held on longer than usual . Seth is willing to give you a massage . He 's taking off the neck chief . Hello ? Teddy ? Probaly gone at a tunnel . You heard the expression " If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen " ? Unfortunately , for some of us , that 's not an option . Damn it ! Exquise me . - It 's okay . It 's okay . *** It 's okay . It 's okay . Excuse me . Hi . It 's been 45 minutes . Is the chef out catching the fish ? That 's a funny notion . I mean , Can you imagine if he was actually like , whoa ! Food ! Just so you know , the costumers are getting verbally abusive . Oh , you want me to call your mommy ? I already did . She was remarkably cruel . There , two . Take them , take them ! Momentum . That 's what I 'm talking about . - 13 more what ? I think we both know , sir .

Just dial it down , sweetheart . I 've already made some ... farmaceutical manoeuvres . Hey , guys ! Chicken hands ! My hands feel so weird inside of these chickens . It 's such a great word , chicken . Say chicken . Chicken . - Chicken ! Are you my chicken ? Yes , I 'm your chicken . I have no hands . So , you ... slipped in something . Yeah .

Earlier , Jim called you a jackass ! Okay , that has been taken out of context . Let me explain something , all of you . This is my restaurant . How come the only person that understands that is the guy I hired 3 hours ago ? Oh , you mean Chet ? - Yes , I mean Chet . I 'll take Chet over all of you . I 'll take ten Chets anyday .

We were looking at a property together . No , no ... Let the man work his magic . Problem is we need a big master bathroom , because to be frank , your mother enjoys bathing me . Hey , Seth ! I 'm back . So ? So what do you think ? Brilliant . I love it . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? What do you mean ? Okay , I kinda calibrate my stuff so it 's perfectly balanced , and now you 're ruining it . Okay , you 're destroying it . Okay , okay , it 's garbage now . You made garbage . It is now garbage .

Yes , mr . Garrison , have a seat . Mr . Garrison , some time ago you asked to be promoted From teaching kindergarten back to the 3rd grade . I 'm aware of that . I want to come clean with you and tell you that back then Some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences . It was wrong of us , and i want to make it up to you . Wow , that 's really great to hear . Oh , for real ? ! You 're not kidding ? We in administration see now that you are an individual With your own preferences , and we respect that . Oh , this is all just- A dream come true ! Thank you , principal victoria ! I 'll do a great job ! I know you will ! You 're sure this for real ? I mean , i 'm not just gon na get fired again for being gay tomorrow ? It 's for real , mr . Garrison . Oh , great ! With all the new laws We could never fire you for being gay now-You 'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars . Right , i-What , what was that ? Well , i was just saying that the policies have really changed . You know , if we fired you for acting gay next time , You 'd be able to sue the school district for lots of money . Oh , right , right . You-You do n't say . Well , thanks , principal victoria . Holy moly ! I 've got ta find a way to get fired for being gay ! M'kay , kids , i know the past few weeks have been really hard With the death of your teacher , ms . Choksondik . That 's funny ! But the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place . So i want you all to give your best behavior To your new 4th grade teacher , mr . Garrison . Not him ! Thank you , mr . Mackey . Good luck , m'kay . Okay , children , now for those of you who are new , My name is mr . Garrison . Where 's mr . Hat , sir ? Well , i was informed that 4th graders Are a little too old for mr . Hat . Two-Year-Olds are too old for mr . Hat . Hmm . So that 's mr . Slave , the teacher 's assistant . Or , as i like to write for short - The teacher 's ass . Oh , jesus christ . Okay , mr . Slave , go sit until i need you . Ah ! Dude , i think that mr . Slave guy might be a - Pakistani . I 'm not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy . In fact , it 's going to be long and hard-Really long and really hard . Oh , jesus christ . The first thing we 're gon na be learning about Is communist russia . No , kenny - What are you doing , kenny ? Now , stalin was a big silly when he ... Kenny , no ! Do n't do it , kenny ! Eric , did you just throw a paper airplane ? ! No , it was kenny ! Very funny , eric , kenny 's dead ! I will not put up with foolishness in my class ! It 's time for punishment . Take it , mr . Slave ! Oh ! Oh , it hurts ! I will not put up with tomfoolery In my classroom , children ! Mr . Slave , put this rubber ball in your mouth . Take that , slave , take it ! This should get me fired for sure ! I really enjoyed the imagery In the last chapter of this month 's book . Yes , and i really saw the entire book , thematically , As a take on corporate america . I think in the fourth chapter , When nancy drew discovers the bloody glove In the cheerleader 's locker , That was just a brilliantly written passage . So full of metaphor ! Hey guys , can we talk to you ? Oh , hi , boys ! How was school ? Uh , not cool . Great . We 're having our book-Of- The-Month club meeting , So why do n't you boys go outside and play . For sure . No , no , he said not cool . We got our new teacher today . It 's mr . Garrison , our old 3rd grade teacher . Uh-Huh . Well , he has this new teacher 's assistant , And they 're both- Totally gay . Kyle ! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals ! Yeah , but these guys are really super gay . I 'm surprised at you , stanley . I really thought you knew how to accept people for who they were . Yeah , but , dad-No buts , stanley . We 're not raising our kids to be discriminators . That 's right , i think it 's time you kids took a little trip To the museum of tolerance . Welcome to the museum of tolerance . Here we try to educate you on the dynamics Of racism and prejudice in america . Ow ! Queer ! Beaner ! Chink ! Nigger ! Heeb ! Faggot ! Cracker ! Oh man , this is awesome ! Now you know how it feels . I wan na ride again ! I wan na ride again ! We are now entering the " hall of stereotypes " . These wax figures represent How some intolerant people have labeled minorities . Here , we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon , A stereotype that hurts the african-American community . What other stereotypes do you see here ? Ah , here 's the arab as a terrorist . That 's right , but of course we know That not all arabs are terrorists , do n't we , kids ? Well , there 's an asian man with a calculator . That 's right , not all stereotypes are negative . But even a positive one , like " all asians are good at math " Is harmful to society . Look ! A covetous jew ! Very good , young man . Ah , here 's a good one . It 's the stereotypical " sleepy mexican " . Wha - What ? Oh man , what time is it ? I 'm sorry , i thought you were a wax sculpture . No , man , i 'm the janitor . I 'm supposed to be cleaning but i 'm so tired . Ooh , i so sleepy . This is our discovery wing . Take your time at the computer displays , because you see , Being tolerant you must also learn To respect people who are small , people who are disabled , Even people who are overweight , like this young man here . Ay ! You other boys have probably called this young man names Like " tubby " , or " lard butt " or " fat tits " . Fat tits- That 's a good one . Yeah , have to remember that . But you must learn be tolerant of his differences as well . If he chooses to eat fatty foods , That 's his life choice . Dude , tolerance kicks ass ! That 's our cartman . Well , that 's the end of our tour . Now do you see why tolerance is so important , boys ? I guess . We have to accept people for who they are And what they like to do . Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? ! I was just-There 's no smoking in the museum ! But i 'm not in the museum . Get out of here , you filthy smoker ! Yeah , dirty lungs ! Go ahead and kill yourself , stupid tar breath ! Dumbass ! Get outta here ! Well , have a great day , everybody . Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant The respect they deserve , right ? Yeah . Okay , children , let 's take our seats . Good , butters . Now , if we take the glass tube of the bunsen burner , We can also see how other things react . Evaporation is an exothermic reaction-So now let 's look at an endothermic one . Mr . Slave , position 7 , please . Now i 'm gon na put the glass tube into mr . Slave 's tight ass . The heat from mr . Slave 's ass Will act as our new conductor of energy . Ahh ! Okay , now butters , Could you bring over lemmiwinks for me , please ? Sure ! Oh , no . No , no , no , no , no . Newton was the first to discover that for every action There is a reaction- Thank you , butters-Now what do you think is gon na happen When i introduce the element of the gerbil To the endothermic heat of mr . Slave 's ass ? Well , let 's see . Ahh ! Oh , jesus . Jesus christ ! How 's it going ? Bad . Why bad ? Chef , we 're intolerant . Intolerant of who ? Gays , i guess . Now why do you wan na go be intolerant Of gay people , children ? I thought you knew better ! Well , we did n't think we were , But mr . Garrison has this new assistant , And we 're really uncomfortable around them . Children , a lot of times , The reason people get uncomfortable around gay people Is that they have some issues themselves . You have to ask yourself , " what is it about their behavior That for some reason makes me uncomfortable ? " Well , i guess it 's mostly the way Mr . Garrison stuck a gerbil up mr . Slave 's ass . Right , and you see , children , That 's why you need to- Whoa , what ? ! Are we homophobes now ? We do n't wan na be gay bashers , chef ! Children , there 's a big difference between gay people And mr . I 'm gon na have a talk with the principal . I 'll take three lunches today , please . You do n't need three lunches , eric , You 're fat enough as it is . It is my life choice , chef , And if you do n't tolerate it i 'll report you to the s.C.C . That was a brilliant idea Having me put a gerbil up your ass , mr . Slave ! Now we 'll get fired for sure ! Well , it was n't the first small animal i put up my ass . Mr . Garrison to the principal 's office , please . That 's it ! They 're gon na fire me for being gay ! 25 million , here we come ! Do n't forget , i get half ! Ooh ! Ooh , jesus christ . Lemmiwinks , you must find your way out of this place Or you will surely die . This way has been closed off by the great sphincter . Heed my words , lemmiwinks , your time is running out . Make for the large intestine . All will be made clear then . * a great adventure is waiting for you ahead * * hurry onward , lemmiwinks or you will soon be dead * * the journey before you may be long and filled with woe * * but you must escape the gay man 's ass * * so your tale can be told * * lemmiwinks , lemmiwinks lemmiwinks , lemmiwinks * * doot doot doot do do doo * * doot doo do doo You wanted to see me , principal victoria ? Oh , yes , mr . Garrison , have a seat . Oh dear , sounds like i 'm getting fired . * doot doot doot doot do-Do-Do doo * Mr . Garrison , chef has brought it to my attention That some of the students are a bit ... uncomfortable About certain aspects of your teaching methods . Oh , no , you 're firing me ? ! Guess i just have to go ! No , no , no ! We 're not firing you . You 're not ? No , we 're sending chef to a tolerance seminar . Sending chef to a tolerance seminar ? ! You got to be crazy ! You 've demonstrated a lack of tolerance For mr . Garrison 's behavior . In fact , i believe you used to words " sick queer " To describe his conduct in class . He is a sick queer ! Yeah ! I just wanted to give you an opportunity To apologize to mr.Garrison before i sent you away , chef . Kiss my black ass ! Parents , i had to call you in here because your boys Have refused to attend class With their homosexual teachers , m'kay . We 're not staying in class another minute With those queermos ! Well , i really thought you boys learned something At the museum of tolerance . But apparently all you learned Was new words to call your poor teachers ! Yes , sir . Mr . Mackey , we 've done everything we can To raise compassionate children . We do n't know where else to turn ! Well , there is an intensive seminar camp . It 's a bit severe , but it might be the only way , m'kay . That sounds good to me . Me too ! Then it 's settled . Boys , you 're going to tolerance camp ! Tolerance camp ? Velcome to tolerance camp . You are here because you would not accept people 's differences . Because you refused to accept the life choices Of your fellow man . Well , those days are now over . Here you will vork , every hour of every day Until you submit to being tolerant of everybody . Here , intolerance ... will not be tolerated . God dammit ! How 'd it go ? This is unbelievable , mr . Slave ! It seems no matter what i do i ca n't get fired ! The principal did n't fire you ? No ! Oh , jesus christ . I mean , i stuck a gerbil up your ass And they want to give me a goddamn medal ! Well , it sounds to me like the principal Is just hiding things from everybody . What you need to do is let the parents see What kind of demented faggot you are . Oh , well - Hey , that 's right , mr . Slave . The parents have to see for themselves . The award ceremony ! We 'll put on a show they 'll never forget ! Ooh , jesus christ . * lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast * * to find his way out of a gay man 's ass * * the road ahead is filled with danger and fright * * but push onward , lemmiwinks with all of your might * Lemmiwinks !

It is my honor to present the courageous teacher award to-Herbert garrison . * dump de dump de dumpity dump de dump * * dumpity dump Get along , little slave . Oh my god . That 's what our boys were talking about ? Ding ding ! Ding ding ! He is so courageous . Say , mr . Slave ... Yes , mr . Garrison ? I had a dream last night that you were a real dick . Really ?

I 'm trying to get fired here ! Oh , that 's courageous . Look , this kind of behavior Should not be acceptable from a teacher ! Yeah , jesus christ . But the museum tells us to be tolerant . Yes , the museum ! The museum tells us ! Tolerant , but not stupid ! Look , just because you have to tolerate something Does n't mean you have to approve of it ! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane , Or you tolerate a bad cold . It can still piss you off ! Jesus-Tap-Dancing-Christ ! He 's right .

@@5263141 Now on Top Gear  It 's all about Hollywood . We choose our favorite cars from the movies and tv . Oh , this is sacrilege . " The Sopranos ' " Steve Schirripa hits our track . All right , here we go , baby . And Tanner puts the new Subaru WRX to the test by racing against a dirt bike . Foust : Aah ! Hollywood - - where movie stars are born . But actors are n't always the only stars . Certain cars have been known to steal the scene . So , we were each given $2,000 to buy and modify what we thought was the best car to ever appear in a movie or tv show . Does it get any cooler than KITT ? I mean , first off , you 've got a trans am with artificial intelligence . It had a British voice for an American car , for some reason . It could evade police . It had rockets . It could go 300 miles an hour . A Pontiac has never done that . Now , this one 's a little updated . It 's a ' 95 . I got a new scanner on there . I 've got a new computer inside . There 's no other car these guys could choose that could come anywhere close to this one .  Great Scott ! What the hell is that ?  You 're not serious . Little help ? Your gull-wing door , I assume ? Yeah . Just hold on to that thing for -- I just got to get this in place here . This seems like a terrible idea . Got some kinks to work out of the system , but , behold - - the time machine . We 're going back to the future , my friend . This is your Delorean . I mean , it 's not exactly a Delorean , but for 2 grand you ca n't get a real Delorean .  Do n't be kidding . Of all the cool cars you could have chosen - - - Oh , come on . Fusion , which is something that is , you know , far ahead of its time . You welded hinges to the roof , and that 's basically where your style ended . Did you spend any time on this at all ? Foust : It 's awesome . I bet you 're thinking twice about whatever that thing is over there , huh ? - Is this the hoff-mobile ? - Uh-huh . Does this even count ? I mean , I 've got a time machine , and you 've just got a talking car . This thing will go 300 miles an hour . Time machine . What do you think Adam 's driving at a slow rate of speed ? What 's the oldest car you could possibly imagine ? Was there a car in " Ben-Hur " ? He 'll get a chariot .  What ?   Oh , this is sacrilege . See ?  You got to be kidding me .  Weld the door . I ca n't believe you picked a show that we actually know . This is an iconic car , my friends . Tell me you did n't have a small general Lee . - I did . I had several . - That 's enough . You are n't even in the right continent . A Nissan ? - This is your time machine . Foust : - Yeah . This is n't gon na make it till tomorrow . And you - - this is a mess . It 's a rolling playpen . Look at your dash . Does your daughter know you have all her toys in your car ? That 's a very sophisticated computer system . Man : That was easy . This is a real car that did real things . These are toys . Yeah ? Eat my shorts . - Shall we see what we 're doing here ? - Yeah . " A true hero car does its own stunts . " - Let 's hit it . - All right . Hey , can you give me a hand ? Wood : Both of you have no doors . Foust : Bring it down . Okay . Foust : I thought it would take me at least until the first challenge to prove how superior my Japanese Delorean was , but straightaway it was making an impression .  I just heard him say that this is Michael J . Fox in " Back to the Future " right there . Tanner , you made the Hollywood tour . Check that one off the bucket list . It was an unbelievably big moment for Delorean - - 1985 , when Marty McFly looked over to Doc Emmett Brown and said , " you made a time machine - - - out of a Delorean ? " And the word was immortalized . It 's got more of an edgy shape , like the Delorean had . I was able to get a metallic-silver paint job on the thing . And it 's cheap as hell . Ferrara : This car is an icon - - the general Lee . I mean , it 's one of the most recognizable cars in history . By 1981 , the car was getting fan mail , an average of 35,000 more letters than any other human being on the show . Now , the original general Lee was a ' 69 Dodge Charger . This is a ' 73 Duster that 's - - - All right , it 's crap because I could n't find a ' 69 Charger because the production probably used them all up . They went through anywhere between 250 and 300 Dodge Chargers during the production of " The Dukes of Hazzard . So I got that off a lunch truck . What 's up , brother ? Man : Nice car . Thank you so much , man . I just got a tip from a homeless guy . That is a new record right there . We have hit a new low .  Wood : Adam may have been a hit with the homeless , but nothing could beat KITT I 'm telling you - - you got to try notching your steering wheel like this . Now , I did use a speak-and-spell-type device for my computing . I 'll be honest - - I did n't actually wire all these switches . I just glued them on . But when you hit the " turbo " button , look out . Man : That was easy . Forget it . I 'm fine . Stupid door . That was not a good idea . What 's up with the wall ? I got it right here . I do n't know , but it can not be good . " To see which of your cars has the best performance , " you must accelerate to 88 miles per hour , " then come to a full stop before hitting that wall of boxes . " Referencing the best movie ever . " Because your car should be better than the average car , the distance to beat has been set by a Suzuki SX4 . " And I wonder where we got that from . " Shortest distance from start to finish wins . " Fairly simple . What happens if I , like , vanish ? That 's cute . Have either of those cars ever seen what 88 miles an hour looks like ? - Walk away . Tell them to watch , ' cause I 'll show you . Go . Just go . I hate it when he has horsepower . Okay , so , these boxes got to be where the Suzuki came up to speed and stopped . Okay . I got the radar gun to make sure he does n't cheat . - Got it . - Think he 's ready ? This is n't even a challenge . It 's another way for me to show off how awesome the KITT Car is . All right , we have the radar gun here . We 'll let you know when you 're up to 88 miles an hour , and that 's when you brake . Whatever you do , do not hit that wall . Wood : 10-4 , buddy . All right , rut , go ! Boy : We can begin learning together . Ready , KITT ? Go .  20 , 30 , 40 , 50 . 60 ? That 's too fast . - Go ahead . - 70 . You ready on the radio ? Yeah , I 'm ready .  88 . All right , brake ! Yes ! Can you guys even see me ? ! We ca n't hear you ! Sorry ! No , do n't talk to him . Wood : My Trans AM did great . Marty McFoust was up next . No way I 'm hitting 88 miles an hour . I 'm just gon na tell you right now . Would you stop that ? Gentlemen , the time machine is ready . Okay , we 'll tell you when you 're doing 88 . Go .  Come on . There 's 45 . - 50 . - 50 . 60 . You 're at 60 .  65 . Come on . Come on ! There 's 70 ! Come on ! 77 . 77 ! No-o-o-o-o !     Perfect ! You sure I did n't make 88 ? 77 . 77 . But you broke 88 boxes . Does that make you feel better ? Look , he 's dragging . Wood : We were competing to see who had the best Hollywood car $2,000 could buy .  Our first challenge was a braking test . We had to accelerate to 88 miles per hour , then come to a complete stop before hitting a wall of boxes . KITT and I had no problem . But Tanner 's tin-foil time machine never made it up to speed .  Adam was up next . Ferrara : I was beginning to second-guess my decision to replace a charger with a duster . I do n't know what good this is gon na do , but I 'll put it on . Adam , are you ready ? Almost . Just remember that , thus far , my car is the only one better than a Suzuki . Okay . He 's a  annoying man . Adam , are you ready ? I 'll let you know when I 'm ready . How 's that ? Play with your gun . I 'm gon na have to start further back - - - like Mexico . And the brakes have been going , so let 's see how this turns out . Okay , hit it in three , two - - your car 's gon na suck - - go .   You got to - - you have to use the gun . This is - - really ? You feel like it 's a waste of battery . I feel like it 's a waste of batteries . Just for - - just - - - How fast am I going ? 18 . My speedometer does n't work ! Tell him 30 . 20 . 90 ? I say he does n't break 60 . Come on . How fast is that ? Oh  No brakes .  There 's some . Not enough . Oh !  He 's off in the bushes !  Wow . He may be unconscious . That was a violent boom . How fast was that ? 73 . Damn it . Wood : So , let 's see . - You did 73 miles an hour . - Yeah . - You did 77 . - Right . And I did more than 88 , which makes KITT and I the winners . Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah . - Why do you do this ? - Feeling it . Is n't that what you do when you win stuff ? I do n't know .  He 's such a good winner . Yeah . Is n't he ? Let 's go kick him again .  And now on to something that does n't look anything like a hero car , but it 's supposed to perform like one . So , basically the exact opposite of our movie cars . Exactly . This is the 2011 Subaru STI . It 's the fastest Subaru ever built , and it 's supposed to be fast on any surface you throw at it . Foust : When most people think of an off-road vehicle , they think of a truck or an SUV . But Subaru thinks of this . The 2011 Impreza WRX STI .  It 's all-wheel drive , turbo-charged , and grips like a squirrel on amphetamines . Yeah , there 's definitely no doubt - - this car is a blast to drive . It 's not a supercar , but it is fast . For 35 grand , it 's unbelievably fast . 140 miles per hour on a " B " road - - bumpy , narrow , uneven pavement . It 's incredibly calm , cool , and collected . The STI is the top of Subaru 's performance line . It comes with a 2 12-liter , 305-horsepower engine . And for about 35 grand , you 'll get an all-wheel drive car that 'll do zero to 60 in under 5 seconds .  The grip the all-wheel drive system makes is violent . You get all four wheels spinning in the same direction . It 's incredible , the reaction this car makes . Subaru owners are unique yet predictable . I could pretty much predict that your IT Guy drives a WRX or an STI and he honks and waves at other Subaru WRXes and STIs on the road . The Impreza STI obviously has incredible off-road capabilities , but to really find out how good it was , I wanted to put it to a test . Subaru claimed that this car drives like a sports car over virtually any terrain . But to see how fast this car goes over this terrain , we need a benchmark to race against it . That benchmark is the dirt bike , perhaps the ultimate all-terrain vehicle . This is Eagle Mountain , once the largest open-pit iron mine in the Western United States . The iron ore from here was manufactured into steel that was then used into making hardware for World War II the Korean War , and Vietnam . So , if you served your country , chances are your tank came from here . This 10,000-acre playground was the perfect place for an all-terrain race . Our course would take us from the top of the mine , through a decrepit industrial area , and finish just past a ghost town . Racing across an industrial mine is pretty dangerous . So the attorneys made me drive the rally version of the STI for safety . But even though it 's been modified for racing , it 's not that different from a street car . The engine has slightly more horsepower , and it 's equipped with a roll cage , better suspension , and gravel tires .  My number-one priority is to beat him . I 'd have to use the ribbon of road winding through the mine , while the dirt bike could cut straight through the obstacles and race directly towards the finish . To be completely honest , my money was n't on the Subaru . Man : Three - - - Two - - - One . Go ! Foust : He got a jump start ! Oh , man , he 's fast off the line ! The dirt bike immediately took advantage of its ability to cut across the roads , while all I could do was hammer down . Oh , he 's taking a shortcut ! Oh , no ! Wow , he 's really fast over the rough stuff ! Oh , he 's taking another shortcut . Oh , man ! We 'd split halfway down the Mountain . I had 5 miles of windy dirt trails in front of me before I 'd reached the bottom . Cam took a more direct approach . But Cam was here to win . With all this straightaway , there 's no way he 's anywhere close . Yeah ! Oh  There he is ! Cam 's death-defying decision to bomb down the side of a cliff paid off . We were now in the apocalyptic industrial area . With 3 miles to go , it would be about maneuverability , not speed . The dirt bike had the advantage in these close quarters , and I was falling behind . And even worse , my tongue was hanging out . He just gets through the buildings so fast . It 's unbelievable . We were almost out of the industrial zone when I saw an opportunity to do something I could n't resist . Aah ! Taking that jump may have put me behind , but I was hoping I could make it up once we hit the asphalt . The challenge for us both was to find the exit on the other side . Oh , my gosh . That was close . He could weave through the houses . But so could I . The Impreza was more than living up to its reputation as an all-terrain car . But then cam decided to put me in my place . We were both lost in the labyrinth , and the first to find the exit would take the race . How do you get out of this place ? Cam had spotted the exit and hit the highway . Unless I found a shortcut , it was all over . There 's the exit right there .  Yes ! Come on ! Oh , my gosh . It 's neck and neck . Time for those 305 horses to do their job . Hey ! Whew ! Yeah ! Wood : Coming up , we continue our Hollywood-car challenge - - -  You lost your stick ! Schirripa : All right , here we go , baby . - And one of the Sopranos hits our track . How was it ? It was pretty awesome . I got to say , this is probably better off road than it is on road . Really ? Well , last year you took the mitsubishi Evo down a ski slope covered in snow , racing against two skiers . So , I want to know - - how did the Subaru compare , since that 's the main competitor ? Like , the Subaru was perfect going up those gravel roads . It 's probably more fun on the dirt than the Evo , or the Evo 's probably more fun on the pavement . But I did n't know which one was faster . To find out , though , we elicited the help of our infallible test driver , the Stig . Foust : Stig getting comfortable .  He 's off . The launch of these Subarus - - really incredible , very popular among younger drivers as drag cars for that reason . I can say , behind the wheel , it feels like this car 's leaning quite a bit more than it looks from the outside . Stig finding his way into the teardrop - - now , this is where the all-wheel drive will really set the STI apart from our two-wheel-drive cars on this track , as it can put the power down so efficiently out of this tighter corner . And sure enough , not a hint of wheel spin , just putting every horsepower straight to the ground , building up very impressive speed . Blazing by the grass , not afraid to go off road , tearing by the tires - - very quick through here . Now , this is a difficult section of the track - - very bumpy and high speed . Sti just nailing it through there - - that 's what this car is good at - - the rough stuff . Stig working just a little bit there as he finds the apex with a hint of understeer . Somehow managing to get through the last corner even with a drift , and across the line .  Wow . Now , that was abusive . It really was . I mean , he got everything possible out of this car . There 's no doubt of that . But the question is , is it faster than the Evo ? What do you guys think ? I think it is .  Yeah ? Yeah , you would be wrong . It 's actually 0.8 of a second slower than the Evo , with a 1:30.0 . - Still a good lap , I would say . - Yeah . Still ties with an X6 M - - much more expensive car . We just have a fast board , that 's all . I mean , it shows why those cars are paired up so closely . It 's kind of like the Chevy-Ford battle , but of Japanese rally cars . This is an incredibly capable car . It 's just not as good as the Evo on our road course . Oh , you mean kind of like how your Nissan Delorean is nowhere near as good as my KITT Car in our movie-cars challenge . Wood : We each spent $2,000 to create our favorite cars to ever star in a tv show or movie . Now we were trying to find out who had chosen the best and met up for our next challenge . Wood : You know what I 've always wanted to try ? That show " Rockford Files " ? That guy would always - - you know , he would reverse and then spin around and take off . A Rockford . - Is that what they call it ? - Yeah . - You can do that ? - Reverse-spin turn , yeah . I think you could do it with almost any car . You go first . We 'll try it after you . - Done . Foust : All right , so , basically I want to get up to speed , crank the wheel one rotation , lift off the gas . When it gets halfway around , hit the brake , get the steering wheel straight , put it in a forward gear , and drive away , okay ? Simple as that . I ca n't wait to see this . You think his door 's gon na fly open ? Oh , totally .  Like a little bird . I think he 's gon na lose the entire air-conditioning system . Okay , here we go , full throttle . Got to get up - - Oh , it 's not fast . There 's that .   There went his prop rod for the door . That was so scary . That was nuts , huh ? You forgot your door post . The door threw me off . I felt like everything was gon na come out the door . Well , you stayed in . My general Lee was up next . I 'll be honest with you - - I am not worried about my door flying open because I welded it shut . I am worried , however , of the front end falling off , having enough power , turning , braking , and stopping . - Do you think he 's gon na do okay ? - No . - Slow-steering rack , so he ca n't get it around . - Sure . And then when it does come around , he 's not gon na turn enough , so he 's gon na end up backing up into us , okay ? Can you run in those shoes ? All right .  Huh ? ! - Impressive . - Uh-huh . - Impressive . - Pretty nice , huh ? I do n't know what to say . It was so ugly and so slow . Wood : Adam tried , but his Rockford turn was n't a success . This is gon na work . And Steve Schirripa - - - Schirripa : All right , here we go , baby . - Tries something he 's never done before . Like a jockey - - " come on ! " We have been given each 2,000$ to re-create our favorite cars from Hollywood . My " Knight Rider " knock-off won the braking challenge . - What ? - Yes ! Tanner 's " Back to the Future " copy had completed the Rockford turn - - - and Adam 's " Dukes of Hazzard " stand-in failed miserably at both . Oh   KITT had a chance to make it 2-2 as we lined up for a try at the rockford turn . Wood : All right , I 'm gon na try the rockford . I 've got the fastest car here . This is gon na work . Come on , you big hick . Let 's go ! Here he comes . All right . All right . Hauling ass , hauling ass , hauling ass , hauling ass . Whoa-ho-ho ! Girl : - - - To take a nap . I am the greatest driver of all time . Foust : Rutledge may have thought he pulled off the stunt , but he went into the dirt and lost forward momentum , making me the winner . It was a little off-road , though . - What happened to the -- - Yeah . Are you kidding me ? This meant he and I were tied going into our last challenge . Now it 's time for what we call " Big star , small car . " That 's where we take a celebrity , put him in our Suzuki , let him go around the track to see who can set the fastest lap time . And I am very pleased today because our celebrity is a good friend of mine . You know him from " The Sopranos " -- - Steve Schirripa . - Hey , buddy .  Good to see you , pal . Thanks for being here . All right . When was the last time you drove ? The last time I drove was about eight months ago . - Eight months ago ? - Eight months . - You should be fine . - Yeah .  Let 's go !  I am an absolute wreck . I should have wore a depends . I 'm not joking . Ferrara : Okay , we have to get some seat covers for the Suzuki . All right , here we go , baby . All right , he 's off . I ca n't come in last . I just ca n't . Oh , boy . Okay , he 's heading towards the first turn . And the Suzuki 's a snug fit . All right , come on . Come on . Come on . Easy on that corner , baby , easy on that corner . I would make a good cab driver in New York , huh ? Yeah , if you were n't in a hurry . I really and truly am trying my best here . God ! Like a jockey - - " come on ! " Hit the white line ! Hit the white line ! Hit the  white line ! There 's the tires . When you 're driving a car for , you know , 45 years and you still suck at it , there 's a problem . Okay , going into cameraman 's curve - - it 's very dangerous , and - - - no one is concerned . Come on , baby ! Get on your horse ! Come on , Suzuki ! Here comes the jockey across the line ! All right . All right . All right . We 'll see what happens . We 'll see what happens .  Steve , come on up . Steve Schirripa !  - Hi , brother . - Good to see you , baby .  This is wild in here . Have a seat , my friend . Ohh ! Now , did you have fun on your lap ? I had fun . I was extremely , extremely scared . - I live in Manhattan . I do n't have a car , you know . - Right . - And I was n't even a good driver when I did drive , and -- - Right . And then you had to drive a shift . I 've never even attempted to drive a shift . So , the Stig actually taught you how to drive ? Stig is like my dad .  I consider Stig like my adopted dad now . - You do ? - I really do . Do you drive - - you have to drive when you 're out here . No , I do n't drive . How do you get around ? Well , they drive me around .  I 'm - - I 've done okay , you know ? I do n't mean like that . Stop it . - Let 's back up . - I 'm working usually . - When I come to LA . , I 'm working . - All right . It was all subways , buses ? Yeah . You want to know why I suck . That 's why I suck .  You had a pretty cool car , though . You had a Javelin . A ' 69 Javelin was the first car that I owned . And who did you get to drive you in that ? - I drove . - You drove . - Adam , at one time in my life , I had to drive . - Okay . So , the Javelin was a very cool car . - Now , was that the car you learned to drive in ? - No , no , no . - Believe it or not , Driver 's Ed , Brooklyn , New York . - It was school , yeah . You pay the teacher $200 , you do n't have to go to the class .  Then I was moving to Las Vegas from New York , - so I had to get a car . - Right . I met you when you were in Vegas . - Right . You were a maitre D ' ? Maitre D ' . Paul Anka used to own a nightclub . You were known as the " make out Maitre D ' . "  He was . That 's -- No , listen . This is what would happen . A guy comes in , like a customer - - say , you , all right ? - You say , " Steve , listen , I got a girl over here . " - Mm-hmm . " I got nowhere to go . " Whatever you 're gon na do with her , that 's your business . - Classy fella . - Yeah . Maybe the guy slipped me $20 . - Maybe he slipped me $50 . - Right . I would tell the valet Parker , " bring a nice car around for Adam . " I do n't know whose car it was . Right . You know what I mean ? " Hurry up ! " There you go .  So , there was some of that going on . - Pretty funny . - That 's funny . It 's hysterical , unless it 's your car .  The guy comes , picks up his - but he never knew . - What do you mean , " he never knew " ? The wife gets in the car in the morning and goes  " It smells like - - - "  " Where the hell were you last night ? " " I swear to God I was at Paul Anka 's club . I was by myself . " So , you were n't the valet guy . - You did n't park the cars . - No , no . Park the cars - - what , are you kidding me ? I 'm lucky I got myself to work . All right , well , let 's see how good you are . - Okay . I 'm gon na go low . I 'm gon na -- Okay . I 'm gon na hold - - well , look - - I will tell you this - - you did it in 1:55.02 - - - Ah .  .. Which means you - -  Let me show you where you are , man . Let me show you where you are . 1:55.02 . You tied Michelle Rodriguez , who was in " The Fast and the Furious . " All right . That 's not bad . I 've never had this opportunity before . Do you want to be on top or on the bottom of Michelle Rodriguez ?  I 'll go on top .  All right , all right , I 'm not -- I am proud of that . You should be . - I am proud of that . - He learned to drive a stick this morning . All right ? I 'm proud of that .  That 's a good job . " - " My mother the car " ? - You ever see that car ? - Black and white ? The car talked . The mother was in the car . Got reincarnated as the car . " My mother the car " - - anybody remember that ?  Steve Schirripa . And he learned to drive a stick this morning .  Not bad . That 's a great job , my man . Thanks , man . Wood : Coming up , our Hollywood cars are put to the ultimate test when they face the challenge of outrunning the baddest guy we know . Foust : Aah ! Ferrara : We were competing to see who had the best $2,000 car . Oh   Rut 's really bad " Knight Rider " won the braking test , and Tanner won the Rockford turn . So they were tied . " One of the classic skills of a hero car " is the ability to outrun the bad guys . " To find out which of you chose the best getaway car , " you 'll now try to evade a typical villain 's car . " The villain will pursue your car around this track . " To catch you , he 'll need to pass your car with his . Be sure to avoid the movie-prop obstacles in your path . " Where 's the villain ?  Of course the Stig is here . " You have a 15-second head start . The car that avoids capture the longest wins . " So , you go first . You ready there , Stig ? All right .  Oh , man , those guys know that this car is not fast . Problem is , the car 's just remarkably heavy for how much power it has - - 160 horsepower , and it weighs 3,000 pounds . It 's ridiculous . All right , Tanner . Go , baby ! Go , baby ! Go ! That 's really full-throttle . That 's sad that 's it . Look at it . Wheels . Look at that . He is rarin ' to go . There we go .   Look at the damn door . Oh , man , we 're flat-trucking it a little bit . There he is ! Oh , no ! Aah ! Whoa !  Through the barrier ! Little crash there ! It 's okay !  Come on - - - Stig is definitely getting closer . Look at that .  Here it comes . He 's gon na catch him now .  Okay , he 's got me . He 's got me . He 's got me . He 's got me . He 's there . How long ? 3:05 . I 'd say I lasted pretty long there . I 'm kind of surprised , to be honest with you . Tanner 's time was just over 3:00 . Ferrara : Okay . Half a seat belt , six cylinders , limited braking , terrible handling , and I 'm being chased by the Stig . This is n't good . You ready for this ? Okay . Three , two , one , go ! That was not very exciting . Does he know this is a race ? Come on . Come on , come on . Oh , there you go , baby .  That thing looks like kind of classic . Here comes the Stig . Hold on . That 's it . Shift when you have to . Shift when you have to . Do n't stall . Do n't stall . Do n't stall .  What 's he doing ? Do n't stall . Do n't - - oh , you ca n't stall now . Whoa ! That 's not good . Hey , stop the clock . Stop the clock . That 's it . My duster may have looked the part , but it just did n't have the speed . If I was gon na beat Tanner , I 'd have to keep the Stig at bay for longer than 3:05 . Me and KITT were ready . - I know that he 's got a car that sounds fast . - Yeah . Is it quick ? He 's got a button he thinks that makes it quick . David Hasselhoff , I need you . I need you right now . Three , two , one , go ! Yeah , there it is . Oh , I 'm missing part of the steering wheel . That is not gon na be very helpful . Stig is on it .  I really need that other part of the steering wheel . Rutledge is almost on the wall . Oh , Stig is working for it . Oh ! Oh ! I 'm almost sliding ! Oh , no ! - He just passed you 1:19 , 1:20 . - Damn . Of course he 's passed me . There 's no fruit to hit . Come on , Stig ! Oh , he 's got him . Oh   2:56 , 2:57 .  Oh , man ! Why did I cut this steering wheel ? Ugh !  Oh , that -- - Did you hit your little " turbo " button ? - I tried . The problem is I kept reaching for the steering wheel , and I had cut a little too much of it .  How 'd I do ? You beat me . You did . Okay . Thank you . You beat me . And - - - Did I beat you ? No , no . See - - Did I beat you ? You throttled him !  What ? What was the time ? Tell me the time that I got . 3:34 . Ooh . This is awesome ! I knew I 'd beat you guys ! Oh , this is what this feels like . Oh ! I beat you ! I beat you ! Sorry . I beat you . This jacket was the best idea I 've ever had . Should we just leave him here , basking ? Let him bask . You bask . We 'll leave . Winner . That just happened ! Do n't turn around . Do n't turn around . Yeah , that just happened ! Just keep walking .  Stop it . Yes . Just stop it . I love the gloating . It fits a grown man . It 's great . Thank you . Look , I 'm sorry . I do n't get the opportunity to beat you guys at stuff that often . It just felt so good . Okay , but it 's a budget win I could have got a real charger , and I would have beat you . A budget win ? If I had a real Delorean , I would have gone - - - Slower . Yes .  I mean , the whole challenge here was to buy the best movie car you could for 2 grand . The KITT was it . I win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@5263241 Previously on Witches of East End ... - I was here first . - Actually , I was here first . The whole " look at me , I 'm so cute " thing does n't work with me . You murdered your own brother . I did n't murder you ! - Killian is dead . - It sounds like you had a vision . You have a gift for premonition . So he might still be alive . What 's happening to you is not scientific . You 're not gon na find the reason in an MRI . I got the MRI scan . I found a match . Ingrid Beauchamp . Nice to see you again . I knew something came through the portal . I tracked him to the woods tonight . We need to know who we 're dealing with . There 's a reason he does n't want us to know who he is . Stay the hell away from me . What do you think the girls are gon na say when I tell them that you left their brother behind ? Frederick ? I do n't trust him . Where have you been ? I c ... I ca n't remember . Did anyone or anything come through the portal with you ? Hey . What 's going on ? I 'm worried about Ingrid . What time did she come home from the bar last night ? Uh , midnight ? I do n't know . Uh , she said she wanted - to walk home . - Uh , Ingrid ? Call me back . Immediately . I think something 's happened to her . Mom . Oh , my God ! Ingrid ! Oh , Ingrid . Still shooting blanks ? Um ... Yeah , uh , this is Dr . Gardiner . Did you receive the e-mail I sent you ? Y-Yeah . Yeah . I saw you kill your brother . I have the evidence . Would you like me to send it to the police ? No . Then I 'm gon na need $50,000 in cash today . Today ? That-that 's impossible . Not for you it is n't . There-there 's no way . We both know you 're loaded , Dr . Gardiner . Figure it out . I 'll be in touch . You 're screwed . Back off ! You better get a hold of this before you kill someone . I mean someone else . She 's so cold . Well , she 's alive that 's what counts . Ingrid ? Ingrid . What happened ? You must have been sleepwalking again . Either that or she passed out - cold in the yard . - What ? I 'm just saying she was pretty drunk last night . Oh , my God . That 's all right , Sweetie . We 'll heal those . What about the sleepwalking ? We 'll have to find a spell . This is n't safe . You know what 's crazy is that I think that was the best night 's sleep I 've had in years . And I 'm starving . I want pancakes ... - Yeah ? - and eggs and bacon and tacos ! I would kill for a taco ! Besides , uh , we need to talk . Okay . First I want to say I am sorry that I did n't tell you girls the truth sooner . I really , I really did have my reas ... reason ... Well , we can talk about that later . So ... okay . Here goes . All right . 400 years ago , in Asgard , there was a war . And ... You have a brother . And he 's upstairs asleep . - What ? ! - Thank you , Wendy . It 's like a Band-Aid . You just got to yank it off . - A brother ? - Are you kidding ? Wh ... how could you 've never told us this ? ! I 'm so sorry . Leaving Frederick behind was one of the most painful decisions I 've ever had to make . Actually , he chose to stay behind in Asgard all of these years with your grandfather . Otherwise known as the guy who cursed all of us . And we 're very lucky that he did because it was Frederick who cured me last night . The argenteum is completely out of my system . - Wait , what ? How does that happen ? - How can he do that ? I-It 's a miracle ! So , our brother is the one who came through the portal . But Wendy saw a shadow in the woods and she said his aura was vicious - and predatory . - Exactly . Well-well , we think that someone else came through the portal at the same time and that 's the dark aura that - Wendy saw in the woods . - It might ... It was . It was . ... have been . Freya , Ingrid . I ca n't believe it 's really you . Now , you used to wake me up in middle of the night , Freya . In the dead of winter . " I want to watch the sun rise on Ayre Beach . " Which , mind you , is a thousand miles away . But I could never refuse you , either . So , we-we 'd do the spell . We 'd join hands and then ... there we were . Standing in the warm sand , watching the sun come up . We had some of our best talks on that beach . I still think about them . Uh , I do n't understand . How would we get there ? Well , we were n't actually there . We 'd simply project our , uh , thought bodies . It 's a spell we used to do together . That 's astro-projection . That 's incredible . Did you ever do that with me ? No . No , it only works with Freya because we 're twins . Oh , my God ! That is crazy ! I always wanted a twin . I used to talk about this all the time - when we were kids . Do you remember ? - I know . I always thought she was just being narcissistic , like you wanted another version of you around . I missed you so much . You know that Frederick is alone in the kitchen right now with your daughters while you 're out here what ? Pulling weeds ? I 'm not pulling weeds . I 'm picking radix sinceritate . Ah , truth root ! If Freya 's right and Dash does have powers , I want to confirm . She could be in real danger . So , I 'm gon na put it in a pie I 'm making and take it up to Fair Haven later . You want to come ? That 's your plan ? Magic pie ? He does n't have to eat it all . He just has to get a whiff of it . It 's pretty strong stuff . I saw Dash last night . He is angry , volatile . We have to approach this carefully . That was the idea . Are you in or out ? Oh , I 'm in . I do n't need a truth root . When Frederick healed me last night , I saw the truth . I could feel his love for me . And all he wanted to do was heal me . And I know how ridiculous and naive it sounds . I have n't forgotten what he did to us . But I could feel his pain and his regret . He knows that he betrayed us . And he was brainwashed . Or he ... might still be . Well , he had the presence of mind to escape , and I think that should tell you something . Or he pretended to escape so that he could play on your guilt and sympathy . - Yeah , well ... - Mm . She was naked ? Are you kidding me ? Ingrid ? Naked in public ? Naked and drunk as a skunk on mead , shouting to the rooftops , " Ero regina ! " Why was I shouting , " I will be queen " ? Well , you are a princess . My whole family together together finally . Why would you not tell us that we 're royalty ? Because being royalty in Asgard is kind of irrelevant in this world . And on that note , as I am no longer a princess , I 'm going to work . But I 'll meet you all at the park later for Fourth of July ! Where 's Father ? Is he coming with us ? Uh , I left him a message . He 's out of cell phone range . He 's actually in South America . He went to look for a cure for the argenteum poisoning . But he is going to be so happy to see you again . Oh . So , Frederick ? I have n't had a chance to ask . How 's , uh , how has it been in Asgard with Grandfather all these years ? Not long after you all came here , I realized the mistake I made . I tried to save him . And I became the receptacle of that rage . In the end , I almost wished for death . But I 'm here now with my family where I belong . And that makes all the difference in the world . There . You ca n't even see the wound . You heal very quickly . Must be the Caribbean sunshine . You 're a very distracting man . And I 'm already late for work . Take the day off . Spend it with me . I 'm scared . It 's only been a few days , but I already feel like I 've known you forever . Like , we 're connected . Do n't you think that 's strange . No . I do n't remember how I got here , but I think it 's the best thing that ever happened to me . Sidan du Fragade . Efter finns tyvarr inte hos oss . Kn ? tti moldveg sporna . Hogna atnam at fjorsjka av ? hon ekki kva . Well , hello . I 'll be right back . I 'm serious . It 's just ... I have him as a little visitor ... Oh ... I think he 's gone . Sorry . Oh , Dr . Foster . What are you doing here ? I thought I 'd get started sorting through the materials . Well , that 's very kind of you , but I 'm pretty sure this is what you hired me to do , which is why I showed up today . If you had other plans , do n't let me stop you . Oh , uh , that 's my stack . I just did those . - So , um ... - Dr . Foster , I 'm pretty sure all this work is part of my job description as chief curator of the Venkman Collection . I mean , this is what I 'm supposed to be doing . That 's why you hired me . Here 's the thing . Um ... I did n't hire you . After my department head Dr . Pavlicek called me . She was the one who insisted we hire you . - It was over my objections . - Oh . So , I 'm here to make sure that nothing goes wrong , because if it does , it 's basically my ass . You know what ? Why do n't I get started on these ? And I am sure in no time , you will see that your ass has nothing to worry about . You really going through with this ? I do n't have a choice . This is n't gon na end here , you know . He 's gon na use you as his personal ATM until there is nothing left . Oh , will you please shut the hell up ? ! Hello , Dash . What are you doing here ? We come bearing gifts . Well , if this is a peace offering , you can keep it . Dash , we feel terrible about what happened . Oh , okay . I do n't see why . I have nothing to say to either one of you . I think the Beauchamp women have done enough . Excuse me . Um ... Well , that went well . That 's a scare card , brother . What are you gon na do ? A thousand . You got the flush or the straight ? Let 's find out . Five . $10,000 . All in ... brother . Call . You made the call on a pair of twos ? Better than a busted draw . No one is this lucky . No hard feelings ? How ' bout I buy a round , yeah ? I 'm not thirsty . I would like my money back . Brujo ! Well , considering I was planning my own funeral yesterday , I 'm enjoying today a lot more . Ooh . Whew ! Why does it occur to me only after we 've lugged this thing across the park we could 've used magic ? Magic does n't solve everything . Sometimes it just makes it harder . That 's what she said . Right . That is what she said . No , no , it's-it 's a joke . That magic makes things harder ? Who wants Chardonnay ? - I do . - Oh , I knew I forgot something . The bottle opener . - What ? - Allow me . - Oh ... - Oh , oh . Uh , thank you , but ... we ... mm , we do n't do that in public . Do what ? Magic . Why not ? Just do n't . We 'll explain later . - Here we go . - Frederick , um , I have n't really gotten the chance to say thank you . For what ? For saving my life . You do n't have to . We 're family . And you would have done the same for me . This must be pretty hard for you , huh ? Just suddenly being here . Everything is so different . For the first few days , I was so weak I could barely move . But at the same time , I-I could feel how close I was to you , you know ? And that-that gave me strength . You know that spell you were talking about this morning ? The one where we could go places with our thought bodies ? - Yeah . - Well , if the spell allows us to go to another place , do you think it could also help me find a person ? It 's worth a try . Cheers . Cheers . Wow . An Occult History of Sorcery . Must be nice working in a public library . - Mm-hmm . - Low stakes , no pressure , no one to impress . I envy you . Oh . Excuse me . Whatever . It 's us . The Dagger . The Bridge . The Traveler . The Gatherer ? Who is that ? " La Cl ? . " The Key . I heard what happened . Rum 's not gon na help . It has so far . Tell me what you saw . I broke his hand . I do n't know how . He was ten feet away . What the hell is a " brujo " ? " Brujo " means " witch . " He thinks you are Obeah , someone who has magic . Yeah . So you think that I have ... Magic . You tell me how much have you won at poker since you came here ? I do n't know . A lot . And you said it was like you knew the cards . Even when you did n't see them . Right ? My grandmother , she was a Santera . She believed that there were people who were naturally aligned with the spirit world . And this gave them special abilities . - Are you afraid ? - No . A little . We can do it right here . I just need to gather a few items . This looks totally different than anything in the Grimoire . That 's because this is much , much older . Bi ? r fori brynings apaldr . Magni megint ? ri ; fullr er hann lia godra galdra gamanruna . Now speak the name of the one you seek . Killian Gardiner .

He 's in that room . What the hell was that ? I 'm not sure . Owls can be omens of fortune or doom . There was an owl in his tarot cards . I think we just met it . Well , that one did n't look very fortunate . What are you gon na do ? I 'm gon na go find him . No , Santo Domingo . A direct flight , if you 've got it . - The sooner the better . - Ma'am , I 'm very sorry , - but I do n't see any flights - Can I get a strawberry margarita ? to Santo Domingo today or tomorrow . Nothing today or tomorrow ? - What about Tuesday ? - Uh , can we get another round ? I 'm gon na have to call you back . Is that a swan ? No . No , it 's a Pikachen . What 's a Pikachen ? Well , it 's like a swan . Wow . Thank you . It 's really cool . Ah , you 're making friends . It 's a lot easier here than it was in Asgard . Hey ... That spell we did was amazing . I 've never felt anything like that . Well , that 's what it means to have a twin . Hey . Be careful . Is there danger ? No , but , just , do n't go around doing ... - you know ... - What ? Witchcraft . I 'm saying , just no spells . - I 'm just saying no magic ... - Yeah , I know . I 'm messing with you , Freya . I get it . I learn fast . I 'll follow the rules . Okay , cool . " Les quatre capacit ? s arcanes " de celui connu comme la cl ? . " " The four " arcane abilities ... of the one known as The Key . " I have four arcane abilities ? What are you doing ? Oh , I was just identifying the French dialect used in this volume . This is by far the oldest piece in the collection . Yes . I had no idea it was even here . The colophon identifies the city of origin as Marseilles . You 're were n't handling it properly . Are you crazy ? This is an illuminated manuscript . You 'll dry out the parchment , the ink separate , - you 'll destroy it . - I 'm taking this with me . I 'll send for the rest Monday . Mm . Maybe you were n't handling it properly , Dr . Foster . If anything happens to this volume between now and Monday , I 'm holding you responsible . Hi . I really wish you would stop sneaking up on me , Frederick . I was n't sneaking , I was just looking for Mom . We 're over there . Oh , I , uh , found this on the porch . Is it yours ? Thank you . You 're welcome . Ma'am . It 's nice to see you again . You know , we have n't been formally introduced . Tommy Cole . Not interested . Oh . No , but yesterday it kind of seemed like we were clicking . - No , we were fighting . - But you liked it . And so did I . - Some ... - Daddy come on , let 's play water guns . - Hey . Yes . Okay . You nailed me . - Yeah . - This is my daughter , Katie . And her mom dropped her off this morning . We 're together for the weekend . I 'll tell you what , go fill the water guns , and I 'll be there in a second . So you 're divorced ? Uh , separated . But , you know , we 're heading that way . Why is that a deal breaker ? I guess I 'm just not used to baggage . Right . Other people 's baggage . We 've all got something . " Happy families are all alike ; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way . " You just quoted Tolstoy . The EMT is full of surprises . Who knew ? Yeah . Huh . Okay , look , I like you . You did not just do that . - Yeah . - Wow . - Thank you . - Long line . - Where 's Frederick ? - What do you mean ? I just saw him a few minutes ago . He was looking for you . I have n't seen him . Huh . You seriously do n't feel that ? Fine , take it . Repeat after me . Chango . Yemaya . Ochun . Chango . Yemaya . Ochun . Again . Chango . Yemaya . Ochun . Keep going . Chango . Yemaya . Ochun . Call the spirit to you . Esp ? ritu venga a m ? . - Esp ? ritu venga a m ? . Oh ! What the hell was that ? I knew it . This proves it . You are brujo . You have the gift . No . I do n't understand . If I have this gift , how can I go my whole life without ever realizing ... Maybe you needed to find someone like you . So you could be awakened . We 're the same . I think that 's why we found each other . We 're meant to be together . Hey . How ' bout another beer ? Be right with you , sir . I 've only got three arms . That 's what you said ten minutes ago . I want my beer . I think maybe you 've had enough . Let 's get you some food . Can we get a burger on the house , please ? I did n't ask for a burger . I told you ... Hey . Let go of me ! Frederick , stop ! Frederick , stop . Let him go ! Let him go ! Wait , Frederick . Please , stop . Frederick ! Stop ! Let him go ! Okay . Okay . Just stay calm . Stay calm , okay ? It 's okay . Okay . Good to see you . Happy Fourth of July . Ingrid . Dash . Hi . Sorry . I do n't mean to be bothering you ... How are you ? Uh , I 've been better . I am so sorry to hear about-about everything . - Your mother and ... - Thank you . Look , you do n't have to apologize for anything . I know but still . Um , Ingrid , this is ... this is gon na sound really weird . Okay ? Really weird . But ... I wanted to ask you something . Um , okay . I have this patient at the hospital . Okay ? And he 's been having these really strange symptoms . So we gave him an MRI and ... we noticed these very rare anomalies in his brain mapping . As it turns out , we 've only had one other patient who had similar anomalies . Um ... that patient was you . Me ? Yeah . Apparently we ran the scan because you were brought in with a concussion . The file says you fell off the jungle gym . Right . Yes . In third grade . I-I do remember . Either before the accident or after . No . No strange symptoms at all . - So ... - Nope . Everything 's been really totally super-normal ever since then . Ingrid , I am not trying to pry , really . But if you experienced anything at all , - it 's extremely important ... - He 's here ! Dr . Foster . He walks among us ! He 's carving the ancient symbol of the king ! This is a warning to us all ! Oh , my God . Go ahead . Hey . I missed the show . Yeah . I 'm glad I 'm not on duty today . What happened ? Just ... Guy lost his mind . Started blabbing a bunch of nonsense . What kind of nonsense ? I do n't know . Just crazy nonsense . Do you know what the strangest part is ? Two days ago , I brought in a guy to the ER . And exact same routine the wounds , the ranting ... There 's a serious sicko out there . What do you mean , voodoo ? He had a ... shape or something carved into his chest . It looked satanic . Okay , what was he ranting about ? Why are you so interested in all this ? ' Cause it 's ... I got to tell you , - it 's creeping me out just ... - I 'm sorry . - a tiny bit . - I guess I 'm just sort of fascinated - by voodoo . Like ... - Wow . - I 'm drawn to the dark side . - You 're drawn ? Okay . Yeah , I got a lot of stories . - You do ? - Yeah . Maybe ... tell them to you over drinks ? I 'll think about it . Okay . Just do n't think about it too long . If anything I learned from this job is that life is short . You only get one . Yeah , do n't remind me . - Hey . Something happened . It was scary . Frederick , are you okay ? This guy grabbed Freya , and , uh ... - I just , uh ... - He was protecting me . Very aggressively . I 'm sorry . I 've spent so much time fighting for my life , sometimes I ... I just lose control . Well , that was n't the most joyous of Fourth of July celebrations in history . Are you okay ? Yes . Um , I have an announcement to make . As you all know , there have been a lot of changes around here . But there have also been a lot of changes with me . I do n't know what it means that I 'm the key , beyond the fact that I can open a portal to another dimension , but I 'm ready to figure it out . And I love my new job . Even though my boss just died . But ..... - Oh , my God . You are worse than Mom . Spill it . Hey . I 'm moving out . - Wait , what ? - Are you seri ... - What is wrong ? - No , Mom , nothing is wrong . Everything is right . It 's just ... it 's time for me to stand on my own . And now Frederick will have somewhere to sleep . - Mom . - Well , I think this calls for a toast . - Aw . - I wo n't be far . To Ingrid ! Aw . Too bad we missed the fireworks , right ? Shall we do the honors ? Yes . - Oh , thank you . - Cheers . - You ready ? Mm - hmm . Caelum combure . Caelum combure . Caelum combure . Caelum combure . Wow . It worked . Wow . Five minutes . - One of them Ingrid 's boss . - And ? And the EMT said there was some full-on voodoo shit . - And what does that mean ? - It means that ... we were looking for Frederick right before it happened . He said he was trying to find you . Wendy , please . Frederick did n't attack anyone . Yes , he did . You said it yourself . He attacked the drunk guy at the bar . Oh , who was messing with Freya . And Ingrid 's boss was messing with her . There 's a pattern here . We ca n't ignore it . I know my son . I know what he 's capable of , even at his worst . He 's not a killer . Mm . Cold ? Frederick . I know how you feel about me , Aunt Wendy . - Do you ? - And I do n't blame you . You 've got it all wrong . You think you know me . But I promise you , you do n't . This is Dr . Gardiner . You did very well today . Thank you . You 're welcome . Now go to hell . Hold on . Today was just a down payment . The next installment will be $100,000 . What do you mean the next one ? I 'll call you again with further instructions . Good night , Dr . Gardiner . You know what to do next . 
@@5263341 - Tony , got a second ? - What is it ? I think it 's time I stepped down . Here you go . What 's this ? Access codes to CTU and Division . You 're the new CTU director , Tony . Let me out of here right now . I know the bomb did n't go off . - I just wanted some company . - Then what are you doing out here ? - This is where I belong . - I do n't . Here . Take it . There 's cougars out there . If you see one , fire a shot in the air and it 'll take off . Roger Stanton confesses that he 's known about the bomb for weeks . You have to trust me , David . Your presidency is in jeopardy . Let me help you . No . You 'll leave now . If you resist in any way , I 'll have no choice but to place you under arrest . - You got ta give me your badge , Kate . - No . I do n't believe you 'd shoot me . I 'm not telling you anything . Why do you want me and my team to leave here so fast ? The bomb 's still here , is n't it ? Initiate a grid search on every outbuilding at the airport , starting at the north end , headed south . The bomb is on site . I repeat : the bomb is on site . - It 's armed . - How much time have we got ? I ca n't tell . It could be any second . Let everyone know we 'll be working in hangar 12 . We 're on standby here . Anything you need , Agent Bauer . Copy that . Right here should be fine . I need a relay here . Let me get a look at the circuit panel . They redirected the circuit . Bypass ready . - Easy , easy . - I got it , I got it . Go ahead . Let 's check out that timer switch . Hang on . Adjust the flash cap . How 's that ? - Wait . Cap it off . I need the bypass . - It worked . We 're in good shape . - Good . George ? What are you doing here ? This is what killed me , Jack . I 'd like to be here when they lay it to rest . Got it diffused yet ? - Not yet . They 're looking at ten minutes . - Is there a timer ? - They have n't been able to read it . - It could detonate any minute ? George , they 've got it under control . There 's got ta be somewhere else you 'd rather be . I promised myself I would see this through to the end . That 's what I 'm gon na do . - You all right ? - Yeah . I 'll just take something . Damn it . Just give me a minute , OK ? - Is there a problem ? - The trigger 's tamper-proofed . I should 've seen it , but it was disguised . Are you telling me that there is no way to disarm this bomb ? That 's what I 'm telling you . Goodrich . They ca n't diffuse it . We 'll have to fly it out . I know this airport does n't accommodate jets , so I need you to find me the fastest plane you can but it 's got to be reliable . There 's a Cessna Caravan in front of hangar three . She 's rock solid , cruises at 210 . Get it . Northwest Regional ? This is Jack Bauer . I need to speak with the president . It 's urgent . Thank you . - Did you get a look at the timer ? - Yeah . - How much time have we got ? - 55 minutes . Need a ride ? - Where are you going ? - Where are you trying to get to ? - San Jose . - No kidding . That 's right where I 'm headed . Santa Clara , actually . I 'm fine , thanks . - Do n't be scared . - I 'm not . - Then get in . - No point wandering around in the night . - I 'll be fine . One second you need a ride , next you do n't . I 'm sorry . It 's nice that you pulled over . It 's just that ... Get back in the car now . You do n't know how to use that thing . Get back in the car and keep driving . Bitch ! - Sir , when will you have a decision ? - When will the plane be ready ? - Ten minutes . - I 'll get back to you before then . In the meantime , prepare for the two possibilities we discussed . - And coordinate with the FAA . - Yes , sir . I want maps and charts for both scenarios . Pacific Ocean here , desert here . We 're ready to assemble . I 'll get back to you when we have a final decision . Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . I 'll discuss consequences of detonation in the Pacific Ocean . Lynne will do the same for the Mojave Desert . In the time available , the plane can get roughly 80 miles offshore . If it splashes down just before detonation , the bomb will go off underwater . The ocean will absorb a large portion of the radiation . However , prevailing winds would blow a moderate level of fallout back over the city of Los Angeles . Over time , there would be a high incidence of cancer and other radiation-related diseases . - But there 'll be no immediate casualty . - We ca n't be certain . The shipping lanes into the port of Los Angeles are extremely busy . In the 80 square miles off the coast of LA , the Coast Guard counts two dozen freighters flying flags from around the world , plus an unknown number of unregistered fishing or pleasure vessels . Keystone species would be exterminated , the food chain would be contaminated , and the regional ecological infrastructure would collapse . Marine resources such as offshore drilling , commercial fishing , even recreational beach usage would become hazardous or impossible for many years . The ecological and economic effects , Mr President , would be devastating . - What about the desert ? - We can designate a ground zero . It 's isolated , so inhabited areas wo n't be immediately affected . Towns could be evacuated within hours without any serious long-term effects . We ca n't rule out the possibility of isolated campers and hikers , who would be killed or contaminated by the blast . If the wind shifts substantially during the next few hours , it could blow fallout over Las Vegas . The best meteorological projections indicate that that is a very , very slight possibility . So the overall health risk is relatively small . Sounds like the desert 's our best option . Yes , sir , we do agree with that . But there is one more thing . In the desert , ground zero has to be a precise location . A depression , below sea level and surrounded by mountains , so it could hopefully contain the fallout . Potential target sites are being researched as we speak . All right . Point is , Mr President , the airplane is n't a military craft . It does n't have any of the equipment needed to deliver a payload accurately . To ensure the necessary level of precision , a pilot will have to go down with the plane . - It 's a suicide mission . - Why ca n't we push it out the side door ? It 's too imprecise , sir . If the pilot is flying low enough to ensure accuracy , he would be killed by the blast . One man dies , Mr President , to ensure the safety of millions . Jack , my people tell me that the pilot has to die . CTU came to the same conclusion . The bomb has to be put down on specific coordinates . I 'm sorry , but there is n't another way . Do we know who the pilot will be ? We have a few volunteers , sir . All of them good men . Whoever it is , tell him he has the undying gratitude of every citizen of this country . And tell him we will take care of whatever family he leaves behind . - Yes , sir . I will . - I 'll be standing by , Jack . - Call me back when the plane 's in the air . - Yes , Mr President . Funny , I do n't see any volunteers . When was the last time you flew a plane ? I can get it in the air and put it down , George . So can I . - I can hang on for another half-hour . If you blacked out and it went down before it got to the desert , a lot of people will die . - Come on , Jack . - I know what you 're trying to do . But I got ta say no . Agent Goodrich , this is Bauer . They chose the desert . I want you to clear air space and start immediate evacuation now . Gentlemen ! Load this bomb . We are a go ! - It 's not rated as a priority . - I do n't care . Just do it , all right ? - Yes , sir . - Thank you . All right , Mr Auda . Wait here a second . We 'll be right with you . - Agent Graves . - Tony Almeida . We 've been expecting you . - They told you what 's in the case ? - Personal effects from Ali 's safe house ? Who 's he ? His name is Yusuf Auda . We could n't refuse to bring him . - Do you trust him ? - Right now ? I do n't trust anyone . Yeah . Take the case and bring it into that conference room around the corner . - OK . - Thank you . - Tony Almeida , Director of CTU . Welcome . - Thank you . Must have had some trip . You were 10,000 miles away this morning . I 'm ready to get back to work . I understand analysis needs to be done on things seized from Syed Ali 's apartment . Yeah . Our lab needs to do some preliminary work first . I 'll have somebody get you coffee . I 'll be with you in a moment , OK ? Thank you . The lab is ready for decryption . Good . Look , I might need somebody to do a little handholding here . That man 's name over there is Yusuf Auda . Officially , he 's a visiting intelligence agent entitled to full cooperation . Make sure anybody you assign understands . - Sure . - OK . I 'm gon na deal with this Mr Auda myself . If you need any help , call Jacobs . - Tony told you to assign someone to Auda . - I 'm assigning myself . You 're still not comfortable working with me , are you ? Just do your job , Carrie . So , what have we got ? Most of it 's pretty innocuous . There is one thing . This was well-concealed . Obviously it was of great importance to Ali . We tried to read it , but it 's encrypted . We do n't have that technology in the field . OK . I 'll get our people on it right away , see what they can find . - OK . - Thanks . Sure . - Almeida . - Tony , have you found Kim yet ? - No . We 're still working on it . - I 'm running out of time ... - Tony , I 'm flying it . - What ? ! I 'd like to speak with my daughter while I still got time . There 's got ta be somebody else to fly it . Somebody that does n't have a family or at least no kids . I did n't have time to take a census . I ca n't order anyone to do this . Please , Tony , you 've got ta find her . - I 'll find her . - Tony , one other thing . Yeah ? In my apartment , there 's a safe . Inside is my will and a letter I wrote to Kim in case something ever happened to me . I 'll make sure she gets it , Jack . - Thanks . - I 'll get back to you . - You all right , honey ? - I could use a lift . What are you doing way out here ? I was on a date and we parked . He got a little out of hand , so I got out . Where would you like to go ? I have an aunt in San Jose . You were on a date , it did n't work out , so you 're going to your aunt 's in San Jose . Honey , your business is your business , but I 'm not an idiot , OK ? I know . It 's just been crazy , and it 's a long story , and I 'm kind of in a little bit of trouble . If you have a cellphone , I actually really need to make a call . - To whom ? - My father . We synchronised this with the timer on the bomb . Thank you . Good luck . So the plane has some automatic pilot thing ? Actually , no . It 'll have to be flown out to a very precise location . So the pilot ... Oh , my God . Who 's it gon na be ? Jack Bauer . Jack ! I 'm sorry , Miss Warner , but you 're gon na have to stay here . - Roger that , tower . Thank you . Here 's your preliminary draft for your statement tomorrow . - Yes . Right . Thank you . - How 's the plane doing , Mike ? - It 's at 3,000 feet and climbing . - Out of the city yet ? It 's too soon for that , but they 'll clear the main population centres in ten minutes . This is a good start , but I want to go over it again . Call Davis . I want him to get Air Force One ready as soon as possible . Sir ? - Do you mind if I ask where you 're going ? - Los Angeles . Mr President , if I may speak frankly , I 'm not sure that 's a good idea . It may be a little too " hands-on " , for lack of a better term . The people want to feel that you 're managing events , not caught up in them . I do n't work for them . Mr President . Sir , I do agree with Mike . Once word gets out that this bomb has gone off , there 's bound to be civil unrest . I do n't think you should be associated with that . The whole country will be traumatised by this bomb , especially the people in Los Angeles . I 'm gon na reassure them that everything is under control . Understood ? Yes , sir . I 'll call Davis immediately . Thank you . We 'll leave for the airport now . Mike , who ended up flying the plane ? Did you get a name ? Yes , sir . Jack Bauer . I 'd have told you sooner , but I figured you had enough on your mind already . Cessna 47 Fox , climb to 10,000 feet , 0-8-niner . Roger . 0-8-niner . 10,000 feet . Expect final vectors in five minutes . I copy . Agent Bauer , I 've got Tony Almeida . I 'm patching him through . We found Kim . She 's on the other line . Thank you , Tony . Good work . Have you told her anything ? No . I did n't know if you 'd want me to . OK . - Put her through , will ya ? - All right . - Kim ? - Dad ! Finally . Oh , my God , are you OK ? - I 'm OK , sweetheart . Are you all right ? - Yes , I 'm fine . Thank God . You 've had a hell of a day , have n't you ? - Yeah . What 's that noise ? Where are you ? - I 'm in a plane . A plane ? Why ? There 's something I 've got ta tell you . It 'll be hard to hear , so I need you to stick with me . We found the bomb . It was wired in a way that made it impossible to diffuse it . How are you getting off the plane ? I 'm not , sweetheart . The bomb has to be dropped in a very specific area . There was no other choice . I 'm sorry . But ... Dad ? - Dad , no ! No , you ca n't do this to me ! - Kim . - There has to be somebody else ! - I did n't have any other choice . - Kim , I need you to listen to me . - I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . - Sweetheart , what are you sorry for ? - Oh , God , everything . I 've been so mean and so bad to you . Honey , anything that ever happened between us ... it was never your fault . I love you just the way you are . I do n't ever want you to change , you understand that ? I love you more than anything in the world . Kim , can you still hear me ? Yes . That 's all I 've ever wanted for you . I want you to try and grow up and be the kind of person that would have made your mom proud , OK ? Oh , God . Promise me that . I promise . Honey , I 've got ta start focusing on what I 'm doing up here . I 'm running out of time . I 'm gon na have to say goodbye . I love you more than anything in the world and I will always be with you , OK ? Remember that . I 'm proud of you ... and I love you . - I love you , too , sweetheart . - No . Goodbye . I 'm sorry , honey . What do you want to do ? - I got ta get out of here . - What do you mean ? Why ? I was supposed to get out of LA , but it does n't matter any more . No , wait a minute . This is crazy . Wait . I need to be alone . You OK ? We found Kim . - Jack get a chance to say goodbye ? - Yeah . So what 'd you find ? We decrypted Ali 's hard drive . It 's a recording of conversation that took place four months ago . Conversation between who ? Syed Ali and high-ranking government officials from these three countries . What we 're saying is that these three countries not only knew about the bomb , but they bought it and supplied it to Syed Ali ? - Yeah . That 's what it looks like . - How sure are we about this translation ? We were rushed , it needs to be refined , but the substance of it is accurate . We 'll need voice authentication on all four of these men . - I 've already got people working on it . - Get Division involved as well . - Northwest Regional ? - Tony Almeida at CTU . I need to speak to the president about today 's terrorist attack . I 'll transfer you . - When did this come to our attention ? - Just within the last few minutes . - Who else knows ? - Our Division headquarters , sir . They have ties to the other agencies , which means everybody knows . I tagged it with a section-four security , sir . But I did think it was important to get going on the authentication process quickly . - How long will that be ? - We should have confirmation in an hour . Let me ask you another question , Mr Almeida . Why would Syed Ali record a conversation like this in the first place ? Half the time these people do n't trust each other any more than they trust us . My guess is Ali wanted some ammunition to protect himself , in case any of these three countries ever turned against him . All right . Thank you , Mr Almeida . I 'll let you get back to work . Good job . - Thank you . Three governments in the Middle East may be behind this bomb . Yes , sir . I gathered that . We could be at war soon , Mike . And once it begins ... there 's no guarantee it 'll be limited to these three countries . I 've been thinking all day about something Lincoln said during the Civil War . " I do n't claim to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me . " It 's bad enough that someone tried to smuggle a nuclear weapon in here . Worse that they succeeded . But once this bomb actually goes off , my options will narrow very , very quickly . This is Cessna 47 Fox . I have just crossed over to the low desert . I 'm on final line to target . Any change in my coordinates ? - Negative . They 're confirmed as given . - Copy that . Confirming autopilot 0-8-niner . - Coordinates are now locked . - Roger . Over . - Do n't move ! You do n't have to shoot me . - What the hell are you doing here ? - I felt like taking a ride . How the hell did you get on this plane ? Was n't that hard . To them , I 'm still head of CTU . Son of a bitch . Brought something for ya . It 's a parachute . I can see what is it , George . I already told you , I 'm taking this plane in . That might have made sense back on the ground , but let 's face it , Jack , the hard part 's over . You took off , cleared the city . What 's left but flying straight and level and taking it into a dive ? Am I right ? Unless of course maybe you wan na die . - What are you talking about ? - You 've had a death wish since Teri died . The way things have been going for you the past year , this probably does n't look like such a bad idea . Leave your troubles behind . This could be the easy way out , huh ? You still got a life , Jack . You wan na be a real hero , here 's what you do . You get back down there and you put the pieces together . Find a way to forgive yourself for what happened to your wife , you make things right with your daughter , and you go on serving your country . That 'd take some real guts . Go on , Jack . You got 12 minutes . What 's it gon na be ? You wan na live or not ? - You really think you can do this ? - Yes . You are absolutely sure you can do this ? Jack , I 'm supposed to do this . You need to maintain this heading and this airspeed . The second the LAD reads a minute and a half , you initiate a dive at a 30-degree angle . I got it . Thank you , George . Thank you . Get your chute on and get the hell outta here . - I 'm staying with you as long as possible . - I got it together . I 'm fine . This is not negotiable . I 'm bailing out four minutes before impact . That should get me far enough away . This is Jack Bauer . Patch me through to CTU . - Yes , sir . Right away . - Almeida . Tony , this is Jack . I need you to get a helicopter in the air immediately . We got a change of plans here . I 'm bailing out . George is taking the plane down . What 's George doing there ? We need authentication from three sources for each voice . Division has public speeches from ministers . See if you can get his voice on phone taps . Michelle . Send a chopper to trail Jack 's plane . Mason got on board . We need that chopper to pick Jack up . I 'll explain later . Mr Almeida , may I know what you found on the hard drive ? - You do n't have security clearance . - Mr Almeida . I and my country have shown good faith in helping you to find Syed Ali 's safe house . I 'm asking you to do the same by giving me some idea of what 's going on . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't tell you at this time . You Americans . - We Americans what ? - Nothing . Come . - Sir , General Bowden 's here to see you . - Of course . Show him in . - Mr President . - General Bowden . I understand the bomb is over the Mojave now . It may detonate without causing loss of life . - That is our hope . - That 's wonderful news . - Congratulations on your achievement . - Thank you , General . It appears they had the backing of three governments . - That 's not definite yet , General . - No , sir . I understand that . But for planning purposes , we should proceed as if it is . I request authority to activate plans to invade the countries in question . Activate ? There are plans already in existence ? We have plans for every conceivable contingency , Mr President . I see . So what exactly do you mean by activate ? Putting the relevant military units on alert , beginning logistical operations , coordinating sources regarding the probable level of resistance to an invasion by American forces . Talk of an invasion is premature . I agree , Mr President . This is in the planning stages only . Activate your plan , Colonel . But take no steps to implement without my direct authorisation . Of course , Mr President . Lynne . We may be talking about World War III . OK . I 'm set . I even got to spend a little time with my son . I did n't even know you had one . - I 'm glad you got to see him . - Yeah . Me , too . I do n't think he was particularly , but ... Actually , I would n't mind if you checked in on him . Of course I will . - It 's time . - Yeah . Yeah . Mr President . At this altitude , the explosion should be visible on the eastern horizon . I do n't know if you want to take a look . Three , two ... 
@@5263441 . U . " . " . " . In New York City 's war on crime , the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad . These are their stories . It 's all good . The joint 's goin ' down . It 's gon na be blazin ' . Feels right . Weight 's good . I do n't know about this . Just do like I said , and everything will be cool . Yo , who 's he ? He 's my cousin . He 's frontin ' me the jack . We got ours . What you got ? All right . We takin'a tour of Staten Island or what ? You eating ' all my gas . Just a little more ways out . Yo , who 's that ? You got somebody on us ? What are you talkin ' about ? You need to chill out . That rest stop . We lost ' em . Damn ! They could n't have got that far away . Now , hold up . Hold up . I saw a car in that rest stop . You see anything ? No . Oh , God . 1013 ! 1013 ! Officers down ! Mile eight of Richmond Road . I repeat , we 've got officers down ! T .  .  .  . T . B . Where were their backups ? They had to back off . They thought they were being made . By the time they caught up , this is what they found . But they had on a wire . They could hear what was going on in the car . The wire cut out . The equipment ... The reception 's for crap out here . We 're sorry about your guys . How much was the buy money ? Thirty-five hundred in marked bills . For five plastic guns . Yeah . We got set up . They had one or more accomplices waiting here to ambush us . They took the dough and scrammed , probably through those woods . We 're checking the bridges and ferries . We 'll need to talk to the backups . They 're pretty shook-up . Well , we 'll make it quick . Paint job , the attention to detail . Got a real weight to it . These are L.E.D . Light bolts ... Price ? - Yes  - Williams . I 'm Robert Goren . This is Detective Bishop . We 're sorry about your partners . - We just have a couple of questions ... - We heard that they had a family , kids ? Yeah . Gilman had a boy , and Lewis had two girls . Okay . We 'll keep that in mind . How 'd you hook up with the punks ? Gilman put the word out he was in the market for firepower . Those two punks come up to him , sold him a.38 SW . They said they had five more pieces to sell . They wanted six grand . Gilman said he needed a day to get the money up . The punks said , " No , the deal has to go down right now . " So they came back with 3,500 , bottom price . We jumped on it . We did n't even know who these guys were . - All we had were their street names . Single bullet , point blank to the back of the head . The shot came from outside . - Could I get a close-up of , uh , his hands ? - Why ? What do you see ? I do n't know . Just some interesting ulcerations on his knuckles and finger webs . - He carries a backup piece ? - Yeah , a.22 caliber . - Well , someone kept a souvenir . - Over here . We have a single set of tracks leading into the woods . There 's another road about a half mile through there . Oh , toe , knee prints . This is where he was waiting . There 's no pacing , no cigarette butts . He was concentrated on this . He drew it with his finger over and over again . They found a witness who was on a secondary road last night . Said he saw a male black come out of the woods with a bicycle . Now we know how he made his getaway . Even with a flashlight , how did this guy find his way back to the other road ? After you , Detective . We got a pop on the prints of one of the dead perps , Darren Exree . Lived with his uncle . Uncle does n't know anything about it . We 're still trying to chase down Darren 's friends , but no one 's admitting to knowing him . Nobody wants to get too close to a cop killing . Ballistics confirmed the same gun killed Detective Lewis and the kid sitting behind him . A nine mil . Latent checked the casings . No prints . Thanks . Do you mind leaving it on my desk ? - She does n't wan na get left in his dust . - I like her hustle . - You 're supposed to be on leave . - With two dead cops ? This is the rest stop . This is where the suspect was seen coming out of the woods with his bicycle . But he found his way through the woods , underbrush , gullies , all in the dark . Just the stars to guide him . He , uh , drew it in the ground while waiting for the ambush . It 's a ... a memory guide , uh , to orient himself in , uh ... in-in three dimensions . It 's interesting how his mind works . We 'll give him a merit badge when we find him . Anything on surveillance tape ? It was mostly inaudible . The sound kept dropping off . There was one thing . Yo . Who 's that ? You got somebody on us ? What are you talking about ? You need to chill out . I just do n't like cars riding on my ass . - The cough . - The dead perp we have n't identified . This might explain the cough . It 's the labs on his hands . " Hexamethylene diisocyanates , acetate , chromium traces throughout the body , with higher concentrations in the lungs . Then the kid worked in a custom auto shop . How many of those can there be in Staten Island ? I told you I 'd get you out . Took you long enough , baby . They were about to send me upstate . I got something for you . Check this . This you 'll like even better . No , no . Not here , all right ? I got ta show you how to use it , then we 're ready . You always think of everything , baby . Well , just you . I just think of you . DIXON 'S CUSTOM AUTO STATEN ISLAND , NEW YORK THURSDAY , SEPTEMBER 4 Yeah . That 's Levon . Levon Marcus . He started working for me last December . I did n't see this coming at all . - How about his friends ? Do you know this guy ?  - No . - We 'll need a home address . - He moved last month . I was supposed to redo his paperwork . Then we 'll take the old address . I think I threw it away . You know , when Levon used your paint booth , he ... he always wore this gear ? Oh , all my people do . I do n't like paying fines . Because he had a really bad cough . I 'm sure you noticed it . I mean , the autopsy found ... What was it that was in his lungs ? Diisocyanates , acetate and chromium in high concentrations . And he was only here for six months . He was always wearing his gear . So how 'd he get so messed up ? I mean , it was like he was breathing fumes day and night . I do n't know . I 'm no doctor . What 's that up there ? A sleeping bag ? He said he needed the extra money , and I needed a security guard . If Levon slept here , who slept there ? I do n't know . I told Levon he could n't have anybody up here . So the houseguest did the guns . He used this to shape a piece of metal . Make a tool . Put a lot of work into it . He did n't use it in the ambush . Maybe the killings were the first step . He 's got something else in the works . There were prints from a dozen individuals in the attic , none of which popped , and no usable prints on the spray can or the tape . That 's not good enough . This cop killer did not just fall from the sky . Somebody knows him . What do you got for me ? I 'm not sure . The lab made it up using the form that was nailed to the attic floor . Our missing man , he made one just like it . Do n't spend all day on it . I 'm pretty sure that this is a handle . The rest of it ... a burglary tool . Pop open a latch . But you 'd have to snake that end between the window and the frame ... before you could slide it up . It 'd never go in . You 're right . The window would have to be open ... for this to be set into place . A man rigging it on the inside for someone on the outside to use later . You 'd need two people . But if the killer had an accomplice , why not use him on the ambush ? Maybe he was n't available . The punks insisted on bottom price . Thirty-five hundred bucks . You know , I have an idea where we can find those marked bills . NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 'S OFFICE QUEENS , NEW YORK TUESDAY , SEPTEMBER 9 I 'm not surprised you found marked bills coming out of our office , with all the bail and fines we collect from drug cases . Happy hunting . If I 'm not scrolling fast enough , be my guest .  I 'm sorry . Eames likes to drive , so she drives . - You wan na scroll , scroll . - Thank you , no . Here 's one . A $3,500 fine for shoplifting from a pharmacy in Queens . " Tamara Bates , 19 . Spent four days in Rikers . " The fine was paid the day after the killings . The gun from the ankle holster , it was a.22 . A lady 's gun . Nice coming-home present . Home being her grandmother 's in Brooklyn . I did n't even know Tamara was arrested . - I have n't seen her since Sunday . - You were n't worried ? I work nights over at St . Mary 's . She 's always gone by the time I get home . Do you know Tamara 's boyfriend ? Who says she has a boyfriend ? Uh , this does . If Tamara 's in trouble , you tell me now . It 's possible she 's gotten involved with a very dangerous man . It 's important we find her before she gets hurt ... What about them ? They beat her . She keeps going back , just like her mother . Fingertip moistener . She bought it last week . Do you have any idea why she uses this ? She counts money at a check cashing store on Myrtle . She tries to be good . She gives me $50 a week for rent and groceries . SMOKEY 'S CHECK CASHING BROOKLYN , NEW YORK TUESDAY , SEPTEMBER 9 I fired her three months ago . She kept running up my phone bill , calling an old boyfriend in Pennsylvania . - What about a current boyfriend ? - What am I , PageSix ? - We 'll take the Pennsylvania number . - I 'll check my records . So she 's still paying her rent . She 's still using fingertip moistener . She 's still counting money for a living , but not anyplace that she wants her grandmother to know . - A bookie . - Or worse . You 're late . A fire on the subway . This was a bank for one of our local drug entrepreneurs . Typically , there 's 300 or 400K . What 's your interest here ? Did you know these victims ? We might know the perps . - Twenty-two . - Yeah . It does n't match any of the weaponry in here . Do you know this girl , Tamara Bates ? She 's a counter . It does n't ring any bells . These places go through a lot of girls . I can see how . - How 'd the perps get in ? - Do n't know , but I can tell you how they got out . The fire escape 's right out there . It 's a perfect fit . So were Bonnie and Clyde . They killed 10 people . These two are up to nine . It 's rusted shut . They had to jump . These scuff marks ... Someone took a tumble . Utica Avenue . One of them might be limping , probably the girl . These friends of yours ? - It 's their money got stolen . - I just wan na talk to you ! Look , we got ta have an understanding . The people that did this , they belong to us . They 're ours . If you have any questions or information , you just call me . A subway clerk made Tamara . She was limping hard , getting help from a male , black , in his 20s . The clerk did n't see which train they took . We have her photos out to the bus stations , Amtrak , airports , car rentals . Assuming they 're smart , they 'd be laying low . They do n't have a lot of options . The boyfriend was sneaking into the grandmother 's place to sleep . He bunked in the car shop . He 's a stray . He 's homeless . We have a unit sitting on her grandmother 's place . He did n't sound too heartbroken . Here 's another boyfriend she might reach out to ... Eugene Thomas . Tamara , uh , filed an assault complaint against him last year . She dropped it the next day . Eugene works for a private ambulance company . Tamara 's ankle 's got ta be hurtin ' pretty good by now . They would n't risk a hospital . When 's the last time you saw Tamara ? Geez , you guys . About six months ago , at a club . I bought her a drink . I went on my merry way . Oh , so the two of you are on merry terms ? Bygones are bygones . Your dispatcher said that you were ... Do ... Do you wan na meet her ? Because I 'm sure ... she 'd love to meet someone in the medical profession . - Wh-What are you goin ' in my bag for ? - Because I can . You 're low on ACE bandages . He 's an interested party . But he keeps looking at me . What 's his problem ? Well , his problem is that he 's a drug dealer , he 's short 400,000 . Tamara stole it from him . What 's that got to do with me ? Well , someone told him that you were her friend ... and that you might know where she is . Where the hell did he hear that from ? You know , uh , you can tell us what you know now , or y-you can deal with him later . Okay , look ... But I can not lose my job over this . Look , I was just trying to help the bitch . She called me . She said she was hurt . And where was she ? At the Gateway Inn near LaGuardia . Look , l-I was n't gon na try to take any money . I figured she could pay me some other way . - Was she alone ? - Yeah . It was just her in the room . GATEWAY INN QUEENS , NEW YORK WEDNESDAY , SEPTEMBER 10 The girl that was in here , was there anybody with her ? No , sir . She was alone when she checked in last night . We 'll need a record of her calls . We do n't provide phones . There 's a pay phone at the corner . Thank you . We 'll need the LUDS on the pay phone . The room 's all yours . You done ? He drew another one . He drew it over and over again . He drew a map of Times Square ? Yeah . He 's trying to remember his way around , orient himself . It 's this area here . That 's where they 're heading . Times Square ? What 's there for them ? Well , for these two , uh , the whole world . Look at it . It 's all there . Right there . It 's pizza . - Hi . Large Hawaiian ? - Yeah . How much ? - How much does it say ? - It 's right there at the bottom . - You saying somethin ' ? - No , I was just ... He does n't have his glasses . Here . Just give him this , sweetie . Baby , come on . No . That guy is nothing . You are a man , the man who 's taken me all the way to the penthouse . - No ? Okay . - Keep an eye out , huh ? The next one 's the Doric on 47 th . - You wan na take the car ? - No . Why ? It 's only a couple blocks . Well , your feet hurt . I noticed that you 're curling your toes in your shoes . Goren . We 'll be right there . Pancake house , three blocks down . What 's she doing ? There . All right . Move in now . They 're trying to kill me ! Thank God you 're here . They were gon na kill me for sure . Thank you . Thank you ! I was n't even there ! After that shoplifting thing , Miss Hurst told me they 'd incarcerate me forever if I got in trouble again . So you were supposed to count money , but you did n't show up . What I 'm saying . And then all these people got killed . And I hear Manny 's looking for me , and I got scared . I 'm a good girl . I swear . I just got caught in a bad situation . Looks like your ankle got caught too . I tripped on the stoop outside my ... That 's a great-looking bandage . Did you do that ? My old boyfriend , Eugene , works on an ambulance , and he fixed it for me . He took me to a motel , he said , ' cause he did n't want nobody see him do work on the side . Okay , if Eugene Thomas is your only witness , you 're in trouble . We also have a subway attendant who saw her limp through his turnstile ... the night of the murders , with a male accomplice . That was n't me ! I do n't have no male accomplice ! I do n't have nobody . We 're finished here . Tamara has suffered years of emotional and physical abuse . She 's in no condition to be ... Is that what 's going on , Tamara ? You 're being abused by this guy , and you 're afraid to talk ? I 'm always hooking ' up with guys who end up beating ' on me . But I do n't got nobody now . There you have it . Do n't get your hopes up . They found the hotel room . Nothing left but the party favors . I do n't remember her . He prepaid the room for three nights . Jerome Davis . I.D . From Club 79 in Long Island City . You generally accept work I.D ...  - And if they pay cash . Was the A.C . On or off when you came in here ? It was off . Some people like a warm room . They unscrewed the fluorescent light and moved this table lamp in here . After a week of killings , nothing like soft lights and a warm bath . You know , Tamara 's shoplifting beef in ... in Queens ... was for extra-strength headache pills . Some people get headaches from fluorescent lights and air conditioning . She did n't seem to mind the lights in the interrogation room . They were n't her pills ? Did ... Did you , uh ... Did you notice anything unusual about him when he checked in ? He asked for directions . He asked me if I knew a martial arts store off Times Square ... one with a big yellow sun on the outside . You remember that martial arts store , Happy Sun ? Sure . That 's what he was trying to remember ... how to get there . But that place closed , what , 10 , 12 years ago ? Eleven . That 's probably how long Davis was out of town . That would explain why he 's not in the system . Well , there might be one system that he 's still in . NEW YORK COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT REGISTRATION OFFICE MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 15 Kids who transferred out of the school system . Jerome Davis.Transferred out in 1992 to Florida with his mother . Father is deceased . His records show a lot of medical absences . Maybe because of migraines . He repeated the third grade . Had disciplinary problems through grade four and five . He grew up in Sunnyside , Queens . It 's the same neighborhood as the pharmacy Tamara shoplifted from . Home turf . The one place he would n't need a map . - Hey , how long is it gon na take ? - Okay , thank you . I ca n't fill this . Just give it to me anyway . My head 's hurting . Sorry . I ca n't do that . But there are some over-the-counter medications ... Jerome , welcome home . I did n't kill no people , and I do n't know no Tamara . You do n't know the girl that gave you 40 bucks for the pizza man ? Does your head hurt , Jerome ? Imitrex . That 's some pretty heavy-duty stuff . If your client is indisposed ... - Nothing 's wrong with me . - Okay . Let 's talk about Happy Sun . You were asking around for it . Did n't you use to go there a lot when you were a kid ? I went once with my pops . That 's a really cool place . You remember the wall with the throwing stars and the tanto knives ? You wan na know what happened to it ? ' Cause I found this article . You ... You need your-your-your glasses ? Nothin ' wrong with my eyes ... that 's after you went to Florida with your mom ... and that it was on 40th , off of 7th . You know what ? Let me show you on a map . It was right about here ... on this map that you drew . - Do n't respond to that . - You like to draw maps . ' Cause you leave them all over the place . Like this one . About 20 feet from where these cops were killed . I got nothin ' to say to you . Jerome , you 're facing the death penalty . But if you say you did n't know that they were cops ... Detective , he said he 's through . I want time with my client . Without the murder weapons or the money , the worst he 's facing is a gun charge . And I ca n't promise I can make anything at all stick against his lady friend . That might not be so bad . What do you think about this plan , Detective ? It-It might be worth a shot . Davis 's rap sheet in Florida does n't include any violence toward women . - Not even one complaint . - Hmm . Abuse might not be what 's binding Tamara to Davis . Then what is ? Love ? Maybe for him . But Tamara 's an abused woman . She 's manipulative . She might be conditioned to only respect men that hit her .  Hmm . You know , when she was at that pancake house , she did n't eat anything , she did n't buy anything , she did n't leave with anything . - Where are you going ? - Out for pancakes . I do n't see anything new here . Obviously , arresting Mr . Davis has n't brought you any closer to fabricating a case against my client . You 're free to bring a 210-40 motion . I plan to . This wo n't survive arraignment . Let 's go . Here 's crossing my fingers she bought it . NEW YORK COUNTY COURTHOUSE 618 WORTH STREET MONDAY , SEPTEMBER 15 They 're not talking to each other . They 're not even blowing kisses . She might already know where he hid the money . - Then we follow her . - She wo n't go to it . She 's smart . She 'll disappear . She 'll send someone else to pick it up . - You 're overestimating this girl . - Hardly . These are the records from the pay phone at the pancake house . This line right here . Come on . Let 's go . Tamara , I messed up on your booking form . Your social security number did n't come up right . I got ta fix it before they call you in for arraignment . So if you could just write it here . I must 've inverted the numbers or something . You ever do that ? Great . She did n't tell you ? Sorry . I forgot . You guys , uh ... You do n't know each other . The judge will probably drop the charges against her and send her home . Maybe she was gon na tell you later , Jerome . We were lookin'over your paperwork , and there 's a form that did n't get filled out . You need to read it , sign it . It needs to be filled out before we can transfer you to the Department of Corrections . - What is it ? - It 's just a form . Read it . - Maybe my lawyer should look at it . - You 're kidding me , right ? Come on . What 's the matter ? You ca n't read ? Come on , Jerome . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Would you like one of us to read it to you ? I mean , it 's like he 's a baby . Does n't know his ABC 's . You can shoot two cops , but dumb as this bench ! Leave him alone . He 's not dumb ! He 's smart ! He 's a man . Why do n't you take off his chains and see how smart you are ? Oh . Oh , that 's it . You look out for him . Aw , you do n't let him feel ashamed . You do n't make fun of his problem . Your problem , Jerome . Hmm ? Do you know what that problem is ? Why you get headaches ? Why , when you look at that form , all the letters , - they get jumbled in your head ? - I 'm not dumb . Why you can look at a window frame once ... and build this , have it fit perfectly ? I did n't build nothin ' . Draw maps from , uh ... from memory ? People that have your problem , they think in three dimensions . Some of them become rocket scientists . No ? Yeah . It 's a learning disability . If you 'd been to the right school , you might 've been helped . Instead , they held you back , kids made fun of you , you got into fights . And girls ... when they figured out you could n't read , they made fun of you . They laughed at you , did n't they ? Made you feel like you were less of a man . But not Tamara . No , she saw your ... potential , your rage . She identified your weakness , and she played you . I played him ? She puffs you up , runs interference , right ? Makes excuses for you , tells you what a big man you are . I 've never played anyone in my life ! I 'm the one who 's always getting played ! Did n't she give you what you wanted ... respect ? She used you to get what she wanted . The drug-money caper , whose idea was that ? We do n't know anything about that . When you were in the hotel , and you woke up and she was n't there , what 'd you think ? Did she say that she was going out for pancakes and that you should n't be troubled ? Or did she wait till you were asleep and too drunk to wake up ? Because when we picked her up , she was coming out of a pancake house . But she did n't eat any pancakes . What she did was , she made a phone call . That 's a lie ! They are lying , baby . She called this number right here . It 's a number of an old boyfriend she 's been calling since he dumped her . Do n't listen to this bull ! But this time , she asked him to pick her up . - That she had a surprise for him . - 400,000 surprises . She was skipping on you , Jerome , with the money . That 's not true . I 'm not like that . You know what ? It does n't matter , because in five minutes , she 's gon na be leaving this building a free woman , and that 'll be the last time that you see her or the money . Never ! Baby , never ! These police are lying to you ! Lying ? Check it out . Here . Tamara will read it to you . Call it . Talk to her ex-boyfriend . Come on , Tamara , read it . Read him the number . Read me the number . Baby , do n't make me do this . Read me the damn number . You bitch ! I 'm gon na kill you ! I 'm gon na kill you ! I perpetrated those murders for you , and you were playing me ? Bitch , you ai n't never gon na be a free woman . I 'll tell you where the money is . I 'll tell you everything that bitch did ! Shut your mouth ! He ... He made me do it ! You look at me ! Look ! They are gon na kill me for what I did for you ! They are gon na kill me ! Get off me ! Get off me ! I 'm gon na kill that bitch ! I swear to God ! I swear to God , I 'm gon na kill her ! - How did it look on tape ? - Damning . The girl pleaded to life without parole . As for Mr . Davis , the district attorney ... has decided to seek the death penalty . Are you all right with that ? Uh , now is the wrong time to ask . Ready ? We have half an hour to get uptown . Eames is gon na meet us at the church . All right . Let 's go . 
@@5264041 - Previously on 12 Monkeys ... - They 're coming . They 've been one step ahead of us the whole way . - How ? - I know who the Witness is . Cole 's not a concern . I killed him . We have work to finish . - What are you doing ? - Meet the new boss . You were walking through a red forest . While you 're busy saving mankind , someone has to figure out how to save you . It matters what we do here this time . It 's over , Cole . The paradox has destroyed your ability to travel back to your time . You live here now . It was Aaron . That 's how they found us . Mr . Ramse 's going to try and stop you . And when he does , I 'm gon na kill him . - - ? These arms of mine ? Where are you right now ? Somewhere warm , safe ..... horrible things ... until you lose that last thing you have left ... yourself . But what if you could take it back ... all of it ? A reset switch ? You 'd hit it , right ? You 'd have to , even if you did n't want to ... ? These arms of mine ? Because sometimes the choice is n't even yours . It 's fate . Did n't think I could find you ? Thought you could hide ? You think this is funny ? You 're ... you 're angry with me ? You destroyed everything in my life . You 're no savior , Cole . You 're just a savage . You want to know what makes a savage ? Seeing shit no kid should ever see and then doing the same thing to survive . I was just a boy , watching the world die , alone . Now I know who I have to thank for that . Come with me . Stop this , please . Please . Is it growing here ? What 's it coming from ? If botany were my theater of expertise , Mr . Whitley , none of us would be alive . We 'd all be lying dead in an empty greenhouse . Temporal interference of some kind , or could merely be a random sampling of the time stream caused by electromagnetic buildup , an anomaly . This is not random . You know , I 've been thinking . As soon as my hands heal , I want you to give me the injections . I want you to send me to 2015 . And if you survived , where would that get us ? The mission is over , Mr . Whitley . Then what are we doing here , hmm ? The men who attacked us were sending a message . Focus on our perimeter , double our security . We do n't have the manpower to fend off an attack , not after Spearhead . Look , Jones ..... move on . Well , their numbers are thinning . Looks like your message was received , which is surprising , ' cause it was so subtle . But still , I would n't take it as a sign that they 're not ready for a fight . If you believe their sentries have been diminished , why not a direct assault ? Sentries ? You use the term " sentries . " That is so old-timey . Where are you from exactly ? Hmm ? Listen , friend , I thought they were light the first time I went in , and they took out half my crew , hence our little collaboration , but trust me when I tell you they are lean but mean . I think you will find us formidable . Oh , well , no doubt , but I do not want that place all shot up . After you 're done with your thing , it 's mine . Our deal will be honored , Mr . This is n't something I want to do , but I will . And you know that . I just wanted to save you . Who are they ? There 's a woman . She 's the only one I ever saw . They know it 's coming . They 're planning for it . How do they release the virus ? I do n't know . They 're preparing for something . She said it was " the coming of the 12 . " What else ? They financed a project in Colorado . They 're gon na hide . Some kind of facility ... that 's where they 'll be when the world dies . Ramse . You ever meet a man named Ramse ? Mm-mm . All right , how do we find them ? Markridge . The woman 's one of their key investors . They 'll kill me for this ... and then him ... and then you . It makes sense . It makes sense that they 'd finance the company that creates the plague . We ca n't let him go . He knows more . Aaron ! Ah ! Oh , my God . - Oh , my God ! - Whoa , hey ! We got to get out of here now ! We just ca n't leave him here to die ! Cassie , he made his choice ! Come on ! No ! Cassie ! No ! Cassie , I 'm sorry . What happened was n't your fault . Aaron ... Betrayed us . He betrayed me . Yeah , but it 's not that simp ... We have work to finish . We have to focus . That woman , one of Markridge 's key investors ... Yeah . ... chances are she knows the new CEO . You got to be kidding me . Who are all these people ? Doctors , shareholders . They 're all here for the keynote address . They all want to know where the new CEO is gon na lead Markridge . Leland Goines , my father , was just a man . Except that my father was none of those things . No . My father was only ever a Markridge man . I love you , Dad . Miss you . It 's why we 're all here today , is n't it ? Not to eulogize , but to capitalize . Through continued advancements in bioengineering , through government contracts , through strategic partnerships and a renewed push into pharmaceutical retail , we will realize my father 's vision for Markridge , and we will transcend it . They love her . It looks like she finally got the dosage right on those meds . One more thing . The dodo ... silly thing . Could n't fly , too fat , flapped its wings futilely ... into extinction . My father created Markridge as a place to defy the order of things , to ignore the rules , to laugh at Mother Nature and spit in the face of Father Time ... we will give new birth to what man has so arrogantly made extinct . The lease is up . Time to give the world back to its rightful owners ... the animals ! The lions and tigers and bears ! The furry-faced caretakers . Let 's get to her before they kill her . Yeah . This year , the dodo . Next year , the unicorn . Excuse me . Sorry . No , sorry . Jennifer . Otter Eyes , back from thin air . We need to talk . That whole Night Room thing ... what a rabbit hole . I was off my meds , super cray . Like , I saw things , like you disappearing before my eyes . Lots of nuts in that bar . I 'm all better now . You sure about that ? Because the dodo bird ... Oh , my God , those guys are such dicks . I just wanted to see their faces when they realized I set their money on fire . I have other plans for my company . I hate you . Jennifer , we need your help . There 's an investor in Markridge , a real power player . We 're trying to find out who it is . She talks too much . They 've probably made key investments that have led to significant advancements ... Ah . Bloop , blop . ... in your father 's work . Blippity-blah . That 's all I hear when your face hole opens . I do n't have time for you crazy bullshit . There 's too much at stake , and my patience is gone . Ethan Seki , venture capitalist ... genius . That 's who you 're looking for . Has a gift , knows things ... when to invest , when not to . That 's Ramse . That 's him ? Yeah . He looks exactly the same . I do n't know how that 's possible . Maybe it 's Jones 's injections . You said ... said that they make it so time moves around you . Maybe they have an effect on cellular aging . Raritan Valley ... Raritan Valley National Laboratory ? That 's it . Called about it today . Today . What is it ? We need to leave , now . Jennifer , thank you , again . It 's done . He knows . What 's Raritan ? It 's where they built the machine that sent me here ... Project Splinter . What does Ramse want with it ? My mission begins with that facility . It 's the only thing that can stop their plan . He wants to destroy it . If he does , it 'll protect the future and his son . What are you seeing ? I 'm trying to remember the future ... my past . Your longing for your son will soon be over . I ca n't ... remember his face . We 're coming to the end . It 's natural to be afraid . Who 's that ? Your security . He will accompany you to Raritan . I do n't need him . The circle is completing , tightening with each action . It 's not completed till I get to that machine . It 's been a long time . We had to allow their research to progress without interference . That meant sacrificing influence . It 's a delicate balance , and it ends today . Your entry into Project Splinter will expose us , but it 's necessary . As you know , it 's a difficult place to get into . They 're ready . Gentlemen , prepare to witness Mother Nature at her finest . The animals are drawn to the subsonic frequency of the Core . Mm-hmm . W ... Look , just trust me . For years at Spearhead , this was a huge headache for me , and this many all at once ... that place is going dark . Let 's see what you got . As long as you hold up your end of the bargain . I 'm sorry . The grid 's gone haywire . The Core shut down . It overheated . How 's that possible ? Something blocked the exhaust . The system crashed . This is it . They 're coming . Okay . Initiate splinter sequence . Did it work ? 28 years . Ca n't know for sure , though , can we ? I do n't think the data 's lying . We have achieved temporal displacement and have found a way to make it incredibly boring . I know , I know . Progress is a game of inches , and leaps and bounds are only in hindsight , I 've been around long enough to understand that , but it 's like Kat always used to say , " You know , man , sometimes ... " science is literally like watching paint dry . " Oh , we 're ready , man . We 're ready for a living specimen , and I 'm not talking about a plant . I 'm talking about a primate subject . - You could kill anything ... - It 'll work . It 'll work . This came for you , sir . The money has landed . Everybody out . Let 's go . You too , man . You sure ? I can help with the dog and pony show . Not this time , you ca n't . I 'll finish the logs in the morning . Right through here , these exhaust tunnels are the way in . Let 's go . Katarina ... What are you gon na do with that ? Jones . What is this place ? That 's home . That 's a lot of security ... more than we ever saw at a Markridge facility . How the hell do we get in ? Exhaust tunnels . Mr . Seki , it is a great pleasure to finally meet you , sir . - It works ? - Oh , yeah . Yeah , to the degree I mentioned . The potential is limitless . You 've received the payments , right ? Very generous , yes . The advancements it 'll garner are incalculable , but , sir , I need to know what you 're doing here . What are you planning ? This is my life 's work . You 've made the arrangements ? You will have full , unauthorized access to my machine , yes . The item . This took a lot to procure . Mr . Seki , this is beyond dangerous . Thank you . Yeah , okay , man , well , you know , everything is set , as per your request . Are you sure you want to do this ? Thank you for your work , Dr . Jones . Security breach ! Evacuate through the tunnels ! We need the woman . The rest are meaningless . Tunnels secured ! Nine men down ! We 've got nine men down at least . The doors to the chamber secured . We need to get to the tunnels . Come on . The machine 's this way . Shit . I 'm guessing that 's not there in 2043 . Okay , we 'll split up . Better one of us reaches the machine than neither . All right . Go down this corridor , down the hallway , down the stairs . The machine 's a few doors in . If you run into Ramse , be careful . I do n't really know him anymore . I do n't know what he 's capable of . You ready ? You 're walking through a red forest . You 're walking through a red forest . The grass is tall . Most of the blood has washed away . Do n't move . Cole . Do n't . You 're alive . Tokyo , I thought ... You killed me ? I thought Tokyo was as far as you ever got . Now I know . This whole time ... it was you . Why ? You 're still asking that question ? This ... this place ... And it was mine . Hey . Hey . Easy . It took time travel to create time travel . That 's how it works . There are no straight lines , brother . So now you want to destroy it ? No . I want to go home ... to my son . I 'm done here . If this were really about your son ... you would n't want him to grow up just to die . You 'd let him go . You would n't kill an entire world . Foster found a cure . We 'll find another one . That is our world , not this . I spent the last 28 years living with ghosts . Our only future ... is the future . Is that what you 've become ... someone who will kill 7 billion to save one ? - You 'd do the same thing . - No , I would n't . For her ? You 're gon na tell me ... I love my son . He deserves a future . I did what I had to . Now you ... pull the trigger . Ah , your wonder machine is right through there . They 're about to reboot their Core , reroute the exhaust system . We 'll be back online in 20 , 19 , 18 , 17 ... Three , two , one . Core reboot . Do n't move . Hello , again . Uh ... I would put that down if I was you . Apologies , Mr . Deacon , but you 're looking at someone who has nothing to live for . We represent the future , madam . We do not wish to be relegated to the past . Then stand down . That we can not do . No more killing . Let the people of this facility go . They are no opposition . And in return ? Is this what you came for ? Yes . It 's yours . Do n't believe her . She killed everyone at Spearhead for this thing . You ca n't change the past . Nobody can . All that matters is what happens here ... in this time . Let them go . You let them walk , the machine is yours , or ... I 'll kill everyone in this room . You were my brother . I know . I thought I killed you . I lived with that guilt for a long time . Killing you again ca n't be the last thing I do here . Did n't have to be this way . Sometimes you 're out of moves . Atari . Atari . Whoa . It 's all right . It 's all right . Easy . How is it all right exactly ? Put the gun down . This is him ? Ramse , the Witness ? - The Witness ? - It 's not that simple . You think I 'm the Witness . Do it , Cole . I 'm not doing anything . Shoot him . - No . - Easy . I 'm not the Witness . Bullshit . It 's about his son . I can talk to him . Tell me , Ramse ... can we talk about this ? You , put the gun down now . Do n't ! Do n't do anything . Cassie , put the gun down . Please . He made his choice . No ! Cass ! Disarm them and let them go . Wait . Uh , I would not recommend that . They are going to be a problem . For you , not us . Marcus . - There 's no exit wound . - Cassie . Tell me what to do . I 'm bleeding internally . You need help . We need to call someone . They wo n't make it in time . Send her to Jones . We 're both gon na die here . She 'll save her . She wo n't save me . - You inject her with that . - That could kill her . She 's gon na die here anyway , man . Come on . - You okay ? - Mm-hmm . Good-bye . I 'm gon na see you soon . I do n't think so . You make it back there ... you find my son , all right ? Tell him I tried to protect him . I tried . The 12 are ready . All 12 ? All healthy ? Would you like to see them ? Oh , beautiful . At last , the next cycle has begun . In 28 years , they 'll be ready . This is quite the undertaking . It has to be . Nothing is more important . The cycle is complete . Make sure it is ready . You 're certain of all this ? The Witness has spoken . But what of Jose Ramse ? On this day , November 11th of 2015 , history will show that Ethan Seki will be found dead beside the accelerator he helped finance . His circle will come to an end . And James Cole ? James Cole will flee into obscurity , his future unknown to us . What are you doing ? No one has to die . We 'll find another way . We 'll find another way . We will need her . Lock her up . Come with me . Where 's Cole ? Did he go in that thing ? Yes , and he 'll never come back . You were saying ? What is this ? Cassie . The virus ... is n't there a better way ? Something more reliable ? The release of the virus is out of our hands , exactly as it should be . What an extraordinary itinerary ... around the world , 12 cities in just a few months . Tell me this trip is for pleasure . Not exactly . I have work to finish . 
@@5264141 Hello . Your liquor license is expired . It 's probably all right . My name is Adrian Monk . I 'm meeting someone . Mr . Monk ? Thank you for coming . Sit down . I know your work . I 'm a big fan . There 's , uh , more light over there . I prefer the dark . You obviously got my note . And the money . $500 to meet you alone , ten minutes . It 's very generous . There 's more where that came from . I have a job to offer you , Mr . Monk . It will take you one night . Not even one night . Two hours . I 'm willing to pay you $20,000 for your trouble . My name is Derek Bronson . Bronson ? Bronson technologies . I , I thought he , you ... You thought I was dead . Most days , I wish I was . I was ballooning solo up the coast . I 'd done it a thousand times . That day , seven years ago , the trade wind shifted . And you stayed there for seven years ? I could 've come back years ago , but ... I got sick . Would you like to hear about the job ? Yes , of course . But first , I have a couple of questions . Um , sick is a funny word . Could mean anything from a mild headache to ... When I say sick , I mean sick . Mr . Monk ... I am a leper . There you are . I was getting worried about you . Just get in . Get in . Start the car ! - Well , what happened ? - Tell you later . Let 's get out of here . What are you doing ? Unlock the door ! - It 's a new car . - Oh , Natalie . Please ! It must be this button . I do n't know . Forget it ! Oh , wait . Mr . Monk , where are you going ? I 'll meet you back at the house . Wait , Mr . Mr . Monk , I got it . I got it ! No , I got it ! MONK Season 5 Epi . 10 Mr . Monk and the Leper Any more soap ? That 's it . No , I mean is there any more soap in San Francisco ? Mr . Monk , you 've been scrubbing your hand for nine hours . - I 'm surprised you have any skin left . - It 's not coming out . I can still feel it . I think it 's spreading . What are you doing ? Is that kerosene ? Light me . - What ? - For the love of god , light me ! Okay , Mr . Monk , I 'm not gon na light your hand on fire . Fine . You know what ? You know what ? Get out . You are overreacting , all right ? All you did was shake a man 's hand . You 're right . You know what ? I 'm glad it happened . - And I survived . - Exactly . Worst moment of my life is behind me now . I 'm free . Right . Wait . Okay , now I 'm free . Um , actually ... Mr . Monk , it 's not completely over . Uh , do n't be mad . But I talked to Mr . Bronson . You did what ? What ? He called here this morning . The leper ? He called me ? On what phone ? On this , on this phone ? Yes . Mr . Monk , you ca n't catch anything over the phone . Oh , uh , and now , all of the sudden , you 're an expert on lepers ? Okay . You know what , Mr . Monk ? He 's a nice man , all right ? He 's in pain . He was crying his eyes out . And , okay , listen to me . He upped his offer . He said he would pay you $25,000 . No ! That 's it ? That 's your argument . Okay , let 's go through it . A , whatever he 's asking us to do is probably illegal . B through Z , the man is a leper ! You know what ? I do n't know anything about leprosy and neither do you . So I called a doctor . He 's a specialist . He said we could come in and talk with him . Let 's just see what he recommends , okay ? I mean , it ca n't hurt to listen , right ? $25,000 . You okay ? Are you holding your breath ? Is that Randy ? Oh , my god . That is so funny . Not funny in a " ha , ha " way , but funny in an " oh , boy , " this 'll really embarrass him " way . Miss Teeger ? Sorry to keep you waiting . I 'm ... I 'm Dr . Polanski . Hi .  Hi . So nice to meet you . It wo n't take much of your time . Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that . - Oh , doctor . Can I ask you one thing ? - Certainly . Right over here . - Go ahead . - Is that Randy Disher ? Yeah , Randy was one of my first patients . Do you know him ? Uh , I know Randy Disher . I do n't know that kid . Well , you know , teen years . I do n't know how any of us survived it . We can talk over here . Come on . Mr . Monk . You 're not gon na catch anything in here . Promise . Come on . Now , what can I do for you ? Could you explain to my friend that leprosy is a serious condition ? It 's very contagious . Well , actually , that 's a common misconception . See ?  For one thing , it 's not called leprosy anymore . It 's called Hansen 's disease . See , I 've been talking to this man . He wants to hire us . But he 's allergic to halazzen . Yes , that does happen . - Is his condition full-blown ? - Oh , yes . Oh , yes . Yeah , yes , yes . Yes , full-blown . Full-blown ! - Sir ? - Full-blown . I do n't think you have to worry . As I said , it 's not very contagious . I 've been practicing for 15 years . I 've only seen one case first-hand . I ca n't do it . I just , I ca n't do it . Well , how about this ? If you do contract the disease ... I 'll treat you for free . The hell are you talking about ? How about this ? We never call the guy back . We do n't see him again . I avoid him like the plague . - Please .  Okay . Mr . Monk . - Did you hear what he just said ? - No . - He said it 's almost impossible to catch . - Yeah . In that sentence , for me , the word " almost " is really the most interesting word . Okay , Mr . Bronson has an affliction . He needs our compassion and understanding . You know what ? Let me let you in on a little secret , Mr . Monk . You 're no picnic , either . A lot of people would rather not deal with you , but they do . They reach out to you . And Mr . Bronson is offering us a lot of money to do the same thing , okay ? And I 've been talking to him . You would n't even have to shake his hand . Good . Good . Because I would rather die than have to shake his hand again . You just sit there and listen . Stop it . Stop . Thank you for coming , Mr . Monk . I was afraid you would n't want to see me again . Why would you think that ? My assistant is over there . I know she 'd like to meet you . I 'm sorry . I ca n't bear to have a woman see me . Not like this . I 'm hideous . No . I would n't say hideous , exactly . Believe it or not , women used to find me quite attractive . I never went home alone . After I married Mandy , I resisted those kind of temptations . At least , I usually resisted them . God ! Oh , god . - Have I offended you ? - No . No , sorry . You just leaned into the light . Sorry . I had an affair . That was my first mistake . I 'll be officially declared dead . The vultures are gon na go through my office , reading every file , opening every drawer . They 'll find the letters . The letters themselves do n't mean anything to me . But they would destroy my wife . Mr . Monk , I want to hire you to break into my home , find the letters , and bring them back . That 's the job ? It 's still my house . So you would n't be breaking any law . Why do n't you just do it yourself ? I tried . I , I just could n't do it . That house , that life , everything I 've lost . It 's just too painful . I 've drawn you a map . Everything you need , the layout , the security codes . I just have one question . Why me ? - I 'm not a thief . - Exactly . You 're an honorable man . - I 'm reaching out to you . - That 's okay . I get it . You do n't have to really reach . I get it . Will you help me ? So what happened ? I took the job . Be careful . I could use some help . I am helping . I just told you to be careful . Wish we had more time . No , no , no , no . It has to be tonight . The leper said his wife goes into town every Friday to visit her mother . Mr . Monk , please stop calling him " the leper " . He has a name . Believe me , he 's got other things to worry about . Car ! Car ! Get down ! Okay . Now . Hurry . What are you waiting for ? Go ! - Okay , you 're next . - No . It 's , uh , it 's wobbly . Somebody has to hold it . Mr . Monk , I ca n't come back . I ca n't climb this . Why is it so wobbly ? How did you do that ? I opened the gate . Good thinking . Okay , hold the ladder . - No , Mr . Monk , the gate is open . - Natalie , look . These are the leper 's instructions . I promised him I would follow them to a tee . We nodded on it . Well , I 'm using the gate . Okay , but do n't tell the leper . The leper was right . She never changed the locks . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . He said it 's kinda tricky . He says you have to slide it . Okay . Here 's the code . 2 , 4 , 6 , 2 . The leper thought of everything . They look so happy . Here it is . Top drawer . In the back . Freeze ! Do n't move . I 'm calling the police . What are those ? What are those ? Throw them here now . Now ! Mrs . Bronson , you do n't want to read those . - Who sent you ? - Here 's the thing . I said who sent you ? Your husband . Derek ? He 's alive ? Is he okay ? Well , " okay " is a funny word . So you 've seen him ? - Most of him . - Where is he ? Can you take me to him ? Mrs . Bronson , you need to trust us . There are reasons why your husband can not see you . What , because of these ? These do n't mean a thing . I 've known about this girl for years . Please . I have to see him . - That 's not a good idea . - Yeah , no .  Trust us . Or I can have you both arrested right now for breaking and entering . Over here . Mr . Monk ? Miss ... Miss Teeger . I always knew it . You 're wrong , darling . I died seven years ago . - Are you looking for these ? - Oh , Mandy . She did n't mean anything to me . I know that , Derek . I 've known about this woman for years . I forgave you a long , long time ago . No , please . Stay away . It 's okay . It 's okay . Let me see you . I just want you to come home . I ca n't . Not like this . Go away . Forget about me . Darling , there are doctors , treatments . There must be something they can do . You do n't think I 've tried ? I 've gone to every doctor in Europe . No one would have to see you . You could stay inside . We could build you a room in the new house . What new house ? You 're , you 're moving ? I have to move . I , I barely know them . Darling , that money is yours . Unfortunately , your will says otherwise . Tell them I 'm not dead . I 'm , I 'll write you a letter . Sweetheart , they 're not going to believe me or any letter . There 's a probate hearing next week . You could come . You could talk to them . No , no . It 's out of the question . Not like this . Mr . Monk . Is that you ? No . Yeah . Yeah , yes . I 'm afraid I have one more favor to ask . " Wife claims missing billionaire husband still alive . " " Probate hearing is set for tomorrow . " " Former homicide detective Adrian Monk is set to testify . " What the hell 's Hansen 's disease ? - Leprosy . He 's a leper . - Oh , my god . I thought they lived in colonies . You know , like in Ben Hur . He needed our help . Mr . Monk put aside all his fear and prejudice and offered to do what he could , and I am very , very proud of him . I shook his hand . I can still feel it . He 's not at all contagious . We talked to a specialist . Randy , I think you might know him . Dr . Polanski ? No . Aaron Polanski ? Ca n't say that I do . Really ? ' cause we thought we saw your picture hanging up in his office . Right . It was a case . I was undercover , posing as a kid , a teenager with bad acne . - Captain , you remember that case ? - You 're on your own , Randy . Still tingling . Well , I 'll tell him you said hi . We 're going out tomorrow night . When this hearing was originally scheduled , the intention was to have Mr . Bronson officially declared deceased . Bronson . Which can not be authenticated . Of course it 's not a perfect match . I told you Derek is sick . He could hardly write his own name . That 's rather convenient , is n't it ? It was n't just me . Mr . Monk saw him , too . Your honor , if I may . Mr . Monk , is this the man you saw ? I believe it is . According to your testimony , you only saw him in a dimly lit bar and a parking garage . - Hardly ideal conditions . - That 's true . Well , Mr . Bronson 's nephews have been waiting a long time for this estate to be probated . I 'm reluctant to make a decision based on one man 's testimony . Your honor , Adrian Monk is not just anyone . His memory and powers of observation are legendary . Well , there 's a lot at stake here . You say he has a great memory . Mr ... - You cut yourself shaving , and there 's a tiny drop of blood on her collar . What are you implying ? You were having a sex affair with her on that couch . The cushions are backwards . And one of her earrings fell off . It 's , um ... it 's right here , over here . She must have torn her blouse . I can see it sticking out of her briefcase . Your honor . I 'm ready with my decision . I will accept Mr . Monk 's word that he met with Derek Bronson . Therefore , Mrs . Bronson will retain control of the entire estate . How long has Mr . Steiner been living here ? 11 years . And he never missed a canasta game in all that time until last night . And he did n't have a gig . I could tell ' cause he did n't take his sheet music . He 's a musician . I know he 's a musician . He 's one of my oldest tenants . You do n't think I know he 's a musician ? Mrs . Kennedy , relax . When you called the police , you asked for homicide . Now , I do n't see any evidence of a murder here . He 's dead . I know it . The canasta game . Plus I found his cat starving this morning . How do you explain that ? Okay , uh , why do n't you wait downstairs , Mrs . Kennedy ? And we 'll take a look around for you . Thank you . What are you doing ? Background music . You know , they do n't keep playing the same thing over and over . Sure , they do . - Hard to concentrate . - Is n't it ? Hey , Randy . Look at this . His appointment book . Looking pretty busy every weekend . Captain , look at this . Last new year 's eve , he played a private party for Mandy Bronson . This must be the best first date in the history of first dates . Maybe we should quit while we 're ahead . I 'm so glad your boss needed my help . Mmm , me , too . - Whatever happened with that case ? - Oh , it 's over . Bronson went back to his leper colony on Camino island . He says he loves it there . Really ? Well , you know , I can believe it . I 've seen some colonies in Africa . They 're like four-star hotels . You really are an expert . Well , I should be . Why is that ? Well , you remember I said I knew one person with leprosy ? - It was me . - What was you ? I had it as a kid . Leprosy . Hansen 's disease . Well , do n't worry . - Oh ? - Yeah . It 's the best thing that ever happened to me . Really . Imagine that . Okay . - What are you doing ? - Making a snack . Oh , no . No , no , no , no . No , no . No , I promised your mother . No junk food . - You promised ? - Yeah . I am the babysitter . Um , I do n't think so . My mom said I was babysitting you . Okay . Are you getting paid ? Yeah . How much ? You know , that 's between your mother and me . Why ? How much are you getting ? $8 an hour . An hour ? I guess you 're the sitter . Enjoy your fries . " Since 1840 . " Who needed ketchup in 1840 ? The security panel . Pardon me ? The security panel in Bronson 's house , Bendis security , founded 2003 . The leper said he had n't been home in seven years . It was all a con . - A leper-con . - What ? - Was he magically delicious ? - What ? Okay , thanks . I 'll talk to you later . Bye ! - Natalie ! - Oh , god . Natalie , listen . Mom . Hotter ! Need it hotter . - But mom , are you okay ? - I 'm fine , honey . How was the date ? Oh , it was great , sweetheart , sweetheart , sweetheart . I need you to do me something . I need you to go upstairs and fill the bathtub with listerine . Go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go ! - Natalie , listen to this . - I got ta tell you something . - We 've been duped ! - I 've been duped ! - Are you ready for this ? - Okay , you 're not gon na believe this . - He 's not a leper . - He 's a leper ! What are we looking for ? Evidence , proof , anything . Oh , how could I not have seen it ? Derek Bronson is not a leper . Hey , watch it . Derek Bronson is dead . His wife killed him seven years ago . And she 's been living off his money ever since . I mean , she ... Watch the shoes . She knew that when he was declared dead officially , the will would kick in , the nephews would get everything , and the party would be over . So she found someone who resembled Derek . And she either hired him or seduced him to suddenly " reappear . " Will you please ? That 's why they chose me . Adrian Monk , the perfect patsy . They knew about my problems . They knew I 'd never take a good look at the guy . So there never really was a leper . Except for the guy you were making out with all night . You did n't have your tongue down his throat . Well , I shook hands with one . That 's bad enough . Your leper was n't even a real leper . - I thought he was real . - My leper was the real deal . That 's what counts . You know the old saying , " there is no heart so black as the black , black heart of the phony leper ? " No , I never heard that one . - Well , it 's a saying . Up you go . - Up you go . - Up you . - Up . - Go . - Go . What if she 's home ? She 's not home . We 've been calling the house all morning . - You still have the key ? - Yeah . What is that ? - You hear that ? - Yeah . - Can I help you ? - Oh , no , I 'm just browsing . I 'm just , just waiting for someone . Randall . What a nice ... - surprise . - Hey , doc . This fell off the wall . Right . Yeah . Not to worry . We 'll just toss it . - Thanks . - That 's okay . Well , you 're looking good . Thanks . Well , uh ... I 'll , uh , see you around . Take care . Oh , hey , I , uh , I hear you 're dating a friend of mine . Natalie Teeger . Oh , yeah , she 's amazing . But I do n't think it 's gon na happen . Well , she reacted pretty badly when I told her I used to have leprosy . Really ? - She could n't handle it , huh ? - No . Some people . Actually , I 've been trying to reach her to give her a heads up . I think Derek Bronson lied to her . I mean , he told her he 's been living on Camino island . Really ? I mean , maybe that guy was n't really Bronson . I mean , all those bandages . Well , no , I mean , the wife met him . It 's funny , though . We ... We 're working on another case , missing persons . We were gon na talk to Monk about it . We found a makeup kit and a book on skin diseases . I think I 'm gon na stop by and have a chat with the wife . Thanks , doc . Uh , can I come with you ? It , it , if Natalie is in trouble , I 'd just ... I 'd like to be there . Yeah , sure . Oh , that 's great . Thank you . Why do n't we , uh , take separate cars ? Randy , I 'm not contagious .

She 's gon na dump him in the ocean . Probably did the same thing seven years ago to her husband . I know this guy . He 's the leper . - He 's not my leper . - No , he 's my leper .

It wo n't matter how the story comes out . Everyone will still think I went to go kill Gibson that night . Who 's gon na believe it was an accident ? I believe you , son , if you say so . Look , when your mother and I go to this breakfast in an hour we want you and Nicole to come with us . Why ? So you can save your campaign by sacrificing me to CNN ? So , I can stand by you , as your father . It 's a little late for that . You never gave me a chance to help you . How could I ? I mean , you were n't there ... We are a family , Keith . Keith ! You missed a spot . Right here , on your neck . Rick , help me get out of here . How ? This place is like a prison . People break out of prison all the time . Look Gaines said he 'd let me go after I buried Dan . Now , once I 'm out of here , I 'll call your dad , tell him where you are . Great plan , except you 're not gon na get out . Gaines wo n't let you go . He 's got no reason to stop me . He does n't need me anymore . Exactly . What do you want me to do here ? Replace the keycard we gave you with the one your people are trying to decrypt . Because we 're getting too close ? Just do it , Jack . Remember , Jack , I can hear everything . What happened at the hospital ? Did you find Kim ? It turns out everything 's fine . She was just at a party . That 's good . - Did Teri give you my message ? - No . We ID 'd the corpse you brought in . His name is Alan York . What ? He 's an accountant from the Valley . We do n't know how he 's connected to any of this but we did have a breakthrough in the keycard . Give me one minute . If Alan York is dead , who is the man with my wife ? He 's not an accountant from the Valley , that 's for sure . If you hurt my daughter or my wife , I will kill you , you son of a bitch . What was that ? What have you done ? ... What have you done ? Everything 's fine , Jack . - That 's the spirit . Now the keycard , I want you to replace it with the one you took from the car . That wo n't be easy . Well , I 'm sure you 'll find a way . Not without attracting attention . That would be unacceptable . You implicate yourself you cease to be useful , and so does your family . As I said , Jack , find a way . Fine . The cellular customer you are trying to reach is currently out of range . Please leave a message at the tone . Kevin , Bauer 's wife knows you 're not Alan York . Be careful . - You okay ? - I feel a little woozy . We 're almost there . Janet said the party was up this hill . I 'm sorry , but I think I 'm going to be sick . Just try to take a couple deep breaths . No , would you just pull over and stop the car ? You have one new message . Damn it . Oh , come on . Damn it ! Dan 's buried . Oh , that 's good . You said you 'd pay me when we got back here . Yeah , I know what I said . Well , if it 's a problem , pay me whenever . Well , that 's very kind of you , Rick . But I should probably go , get out of everyone 's way . I did n't realize you were in anyone 's way . Well , I 'm not . It 's just ... I did everything you wanted me to do , so there 's no reason for me to be here . I tell you what . I got a couple more things for you to do . Then we talk about when you can go . This is taking too long , Jack . I ca n't switch out the cards . It 'll attract attention . It will be bad for both of us . You 've got three minutes to make this happen . Drop the pen , and shred the paper . That 's right , Jack . I 'm watching you . Shred the note now , or your daughter dies ! What happened down there ? I was telling you something important and you just walk away . I 'm sorry . What did you want to tell me ? I think Milo 's about to identify the shooter . That 's great . We just need a few more minutes with the card . Switch it , Jack . No more excuses . Um , look , that 's terrific ... uh tell Milo to wait until I get down there . You want him to stop working on the card ? Just until I get there . - Why ? - Because I asked you to ! Look , I 'm only gon na be a minute . All right , but hurry . He 's in Section Seven . I 'll be right down . Palmer was absent from the rally . In other news , Governor Hodges spent the morning with heads of California 's labor unions discussing the importance of his new health care proposal . The proposal would ensure new comprehensive coverage for millions of active union members . Mom told you what 's been going on ? Yeah . Is Keith going to jail ? Not if it happened the way he says it did . It did . Then he 'll be fine . Is he coming to the breakfast ? I hope so . Listen , I know it 's a lot to ask . Do n't worry , Dad . I 'll be there . You 're gon na get a lot of hard questions thrown at you not just about Keith . They 're gon na bring up the rape . I know . You gon na be okay ? I was hoping it was over . Not talking about it all these years I started to let myself believe it never happened . You do n't have to answer anything you do n't want to . Hey , Nina says you were close to finding the shooter . - Yeah . - How much longer ? Not long . I was waiting for you . Waiting for me ? What do you mean ? Why would you be waiting for me ? - Sorry . - It 's fine , I got it . It would have been done , but Nina told me to hold off until you got here . I do n't know why said that . She must have misunderstood me . Smart boy . Great , I just wasted ten minutes . You guys get your signals straight . Milo , just get me the name . Why are you doing this ? No , I already gave you that code . What 's wrong ? I already computed this inverse , and now it 's not working ! It might be the sectors are n't linked . Oh , you think so , huh ? You 're right . Nice one . Cool . - Hey ! - Bad idea . If I do n't deliver you in half an hour , Kimberly 's dead . Where is she , you son of a bitch ? You gon na knock me out again ? Because I ca n't talk if I 'm unconscious . Where 's Kimberly ? Just let me go and I 'll take you to her . You 're not going anywhere . Calling the cops would be just as bad . Or are you calling Jack ? I do n't think that 's gon na help , either . Shut up . Shut up ! Operations . Jack Bauer . Clearance number Q22 , Q17 . Patch me through to Senator Palmer 's Secret Service liaison . Hold , please . What do you want me to tell them ? That you need priority clearance at the breakfast . Frank Miller . Hey , Frank , it 's Jack Bauer over at CTU . I need priority clearance for Palmer 's breakfast . - Sorry . We locked the list . - Open it up . All right . You 'll be checking in with Agent Pierce when you arrive . Thanks . Okay , now call Division . Post yourself out for the next hour . Tell them you 're going to the breakfast and that the investigation is making good progress . Rick . Well , you were right . Gaines is n't letting me go yet . - So , what are you gon na do ? - I do n't know . Let 's get out of here , Rick . Okay , we 're here . There 's a fence here , which is over that way . They 've got people everywhere but I noticed they 're a little thin right around this area . Yo , Rick . Get off of me ! What the hell are you doing ? Give me five minutes , dude . No one has to know . I 'll give you four . No , do n't . I 'll be outside . When I go back out , I 'll leave the door unlocked . Go across the path behind the shed , and wait for me there . Be careful . Sorry I hit you . No , not true . Also not true . This is n't the same keycard I was working from before . What makes you say that ? Because it 's giving me different data . What ? I was 20 percent through this just a few minutes ago . Now it 's saying it 's 99 percent complete . Well , is n't that good ? Yeah , if it were true . But I do n't believe it . This is a different key card . You 've been sitting here the entire time . Who could have switched it ? I need to post out until 8:00 . No , that wo n't be necessary . Yes , I 'm reachable . Thank you , bye . Nina , I ca n't talk right now . There 's an emergency down at Division . Where 's the keycard ? What ? Careful , Jack . Okay , you 're right . I just did n't want to alarm anyone . Division got some information . They did n't trust Milo with it . Where 's the keycard , Jack ? Take care of this , Jack . Give it to me , Jack , or I 'll call Division myself . Fine . Here 's the keycard . What are you doing ? I 'm sorry , Nina . I 'm sorry . But believe me , I will kill you if I have to . Now , no screaming . Get her out of there now ! Put this on . I do n't understand . What are you doing ? Nina , do n't talk . I 'll explain everything as soon as we get out of here . Nice and quiet . Open the door . Where you guys going ? Division set up a meeting between agencies before Palmer 's day starts . - Hello ? - Jack ? Who ? I 'm looking for my husband , Jack Bauer . It 's urgent . This phone was lying on the ground . He must have dropped it . Where are you ? St . Mark 's Hospital , in the parking lot . Did you see anyone ? Did anything happen there ? Not that I saw . If it 's a problem , I 'll call the cops . No . No . Oh , come on . CTU . - Who is this ? - It 's Jamey . Who 's this ? Jamey , this is Teri Bauer . Is Jack there ? - He just left with Nina . - Well , is he okay ? Because he lost his cell phone . I think something happened to him . He seemed fine . Can I help you with something ? Yeah , I 'm in trouble , and so is my daughter Kim . Okay , wait . Slow down . - My God . - Someone tried to take me , too . Did you call the police ? No , Jack says they ca n't be involved , otherwide we 're risking Kimberly 's life . Tell me where you are so I can send someone from CTU to pick you up . I 'm on Mulholland about a mile east of Coldwater . Jamey , please tell them to hurry ! Okay . We 're coming up on the hour . About the time the polls are about to open . Not that far off now . And I want to remind everybody ... You look handsome . Presidential . - Where 's Keith ? - He 's still in his room . We do n't have much time . David . What if Maureen Kingsley could be persuaded not to come forward with the story ? I already spoke to her . There 's no way . There 's always a way . What are you getting at ? Maureen is just like everybody else . She 's got a past . I do n't care what you call it . I 'm just trying to save our son and your candidacy . You 've been talking to Carl . You left me no choice . No one has to know what happened . I 'd know . We would know . After everything we 've been through tonight , how can you justify burying the truth ? Because it 's been buried , David , for seven years . And digging it up again is not gon na change the fact that it already happened . You think about it . Well , ca n't say this gig does n't have its benefits . Dude , you 're lucky . If Gaines caught you with her .. .. bang ! You 're dead . Yeah , well , Gaines did n't catch me , did he ? Come on . So , how long have you been working with Gaines ? I do n't know , on and off , a couple of months . I do n't know , I get the feeling he does n't like me . Here you go . Yeah , he gets uptight when he 's on a job . He 's really pretty chilly . You do the job , you 'll be okay . Cool . So , how was she ? Sweet ? Yeah , she was okay . She 's pretty hot . I might want to dip in myself . What about the lecture you just gave me ? Are n't we supposed to be loading the trucks ? All right . Let 's go . Gaines really wants to get this done . So , what are we loading ? Everything . We 're cleaning the place out . Man , my keys . I 'll catch up with you . - Did anyone see you ? - No , we 're cool . When we get to the fence , you 'll see a cluster of trees . That 's where we want to be . Hi , Teri . Charles McLemore , CTU . - You guys got here fast . - They told us it was urgent . Someone 's got my daughter . This man knows where she is . Has anyone been in touch with Jack yet ? Wait , this guy is dangerous . What are you doing ? No ! Let 's hurry this up , boys . We 're way behind . Put her in the car . Jamey . What 's up ? You got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting ? I have n't checked . Why ? Nina was supposed to brief me but she 's not back and she 's not on her cell . Plus , there 's nothing on my screen about it . It 's not coming up on mine either , but that does n't mean anything . Since the lockdown , the system 's been glitchy . That 's probably why the meeting 's not posting . It 's strange the way she and Jack left . Something happened in his office . Give me a ten minute loop . I 'm not authorized to do that . I 'm authorizing you . Jack and Nina are n't here . I got rank . - Yeah , but .. - Give me ten minutes starting at 6:30 . Send it to my screen . - Where are we going ? - Turn right . Turn right . All night you 've been telling me that somebody inside the Agency wants Palmer dead . Your daughter 's missing , and no one can be trusted , not even me . Is it all a lie , Jack , or just some of it ? What was on the keycard that you did n't want us to find ? Please , Nina , do n't make this harder than it is . You got a gun on me , Jack . I do n't think it gets much worse . Stay on Jefferson . In about three miles you 'll see a turn-off . Keep going straight . Come on , let 's go . Stop the car . What is this place , Jack ? What are we doing here ? - Somebody followed us . - I know . Who are they ? What do you want me to do here ? What ? - Take her out and shoot her . - No . - Who are you talking to , Jack ? - Your choice , Jack . Nina or your daughter . Jack , I do n't understand . Why are you doing this ? Get out of the car . - Get out of the car ! - Jack , what .. ? - I 'm sorry , Nina . - What are you gon na do ? You 're gon na kill me right here ? I do n't have a choice . They have Kim and Teri . How do you know they wo n't kill them , even if you do this ? - I ca n't take that chance with my family . Please , forgive me , Nina . You think I 'm messing with you , Jack ? Turn around ! Jack , if you 're going to do this , do it to my face ! I wo n't make this easy ... Get back in the car , Jack What do we do when we get there ? We have to get to the road . Highway 14 is about a mile away . I know how to get there . You ready ? Yeah . What 's the matter ? Oh , my God ! Where 's my daughter ? Is she here ? That 's my mom ! We ca n't wait . We 've got to go . I ca n't just leave her there . Kimberly ! Is my daughter here ? What have you done with her ? - We 've got to go now ! - I ca n't . Get down , Kim . If we get out , we can help her . We can call the police . You go . Call my dad . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Kimberly ! The polls are about to open in California which is a key state for the Palmer campaign . Earlier polls show the Senator leading by a 15 percent margin Assuming voting follows predictions , the senator ... Jack , you son of a bitch . Why did he give her a flak jacket ?

She got an offer to run a major gallery in Hong Kong , she asked my advice , I told her she should accept . So you encouraged her to spread her wings and fly . My exact words were I did n't want her to have any regrets . There was that time you took Jack on that impromptu weekend to Orlando . Was that to tell him about Beth ? It was an effort to distract him , yeah . You 're an excellent dad , Aaron . Do n't you ever doubt that for a second . Look , there 's , um , this little jazz club in Dupont Circle I planned on going to Saturday night . No , no , no . You 're coming with me . This is n't just about you , Aaron . I 'm , shall we say , intrigued by the in-house jazz singer there , and you will be my wingman . Ca n't wait . Ok , crime fighters , we have a triple homicide in Salt Lake City , Utah . A couple , Ron and Karen Myerson were found shot to death in their home 4 hours ago . Several hours before that , a security guard was found stabbed to death at a small office building . And let me guess - - the gun used to shoot the couple belonged to the security guard . Get your mug out ' cause coffee is for closers . No sign of a break-in or forced entry . Maybe the couple knew the unsub . This could be personal . What was he doing in the meantime ? Watching the couple , conducting surveillance , or he encountered them earlier and was torturing them . But the M.E . and the police both say there was no evidence they were held for any length of time . One thing is clear . Both crime scenes look chaotic . This unsub is disorganized . The chaos could mean that this unsub is either psychotic or under some time pressure . And improvising . And if he ca n't decompress , he may feel killing 's his only option . We may be looking at a spree . Wheels up in 30 . Hey , hurry up ! You can put that away . I told you I 'd help you . Come on , let 's go . Listen . You need to calm down . You did not have to kill that couple or that security guard . You were leaving a trail of bodies because you ca n't keep it together . Shut up . Get in . Have you ever looked death in the eye ? ' Cause I have . And I 've seen the grim reaper staring right back at me . We should wait till it 's dark before we leave . And if you do n't want another body , we need food and water for Rebecca . ? Criminal Minds 10x09 ? Amelia Porter Original Air Date on December 10 , 2014 == sync , corrected by elderman == @elderman . Reid : " Remove my sin and I will be clean . Wash me and I will be whiter than snow . " Psalm 51 . Assuming the kills are personal , what do we know about Ron and Karen Myerson . Both in their 40s . Ron was the manager of a sports bar , Karen a dental assistant . They had some financial problems . Maxed out 4 credit cards . Ron took out a payday loan last week . They were living on the brink . Ron 's been to Reno 4 times in the last few months . Yes , sir . Agent Hotchner ? Thanks for coming out . This is Agent Jareau . Hi , how are you ? We 've increased patrols on the south side of the city since you said a spree killer may be at work . Any activity since the killings ? No , but we just spoke to a friend of the couple who was at a marriage counseling retreat with them . The wife was n't feeling well , so they went home a day early . Maybe they surprised the unsub . Who reported the crime ? The neighbor from across the street . Did he hear anything last night ? Only the sound of a car backfiring around 2 a.m . It could have been gunshots . All right , I 'll let the others know . Good . But they have an armed guard . What kind of place needs privacy and security ? Well , it 's mainly attorneys , accountants , psychologists . Maybe they were worried about unstable patients and clients . Rossi , look at this . Those have to be the unsub 's bloody shoe prints . Yeah , but there 's two sets . Well , the guard did n't make it far from his desk .  Those ca n't be his . It looks like that second set of prints stayed out there by the edge . Maybe he was just a witness . The unsub could have been surprised by someone else in the lobby . Maybe he kidnapped the witness . But a possibility is it was a partner . It would make it a hell of a lot easier to overtake an armed guard . Even without gambling problems , I can see how they maxed out 4 credit cards . This couple likes nice things . Something valuable could have been stolen and the police would n't necessarily know . The couple was found over here . They were both shot in the chest .  Which means the unsub was standing right about here . He came in from the backyard . Well , talk about a bad gopher problem . These holes were dug recently . Look at the dirt . What were they digging for , buried treasure ? Why would the Myersons bury anything in their yard , judging by the safe in their house ? So it had to be the unsub . Came looking for something , got surprised when they came home early . Killed them , and then based on what JJ said , spent another hour trying to find what he was looking for . How did he know there was something buried back here ? We 've been saying this crime felt personal . What if the unsub used to live here ? We should have Garcia pull a list of prior residents . The unsub either has either a partner or a hostage with him , most likely male based on the prints . He was there for 7 years , bought it from the bank who repossessed it from Amelia Porter , a notorious killer in the state . I remember that name . She was a 30-year-old woman . She and her much younger lover got high on drugs and raped and murdered his sister . I think her name was Miriam . The younger lover was Benton Farland , 17 at the time , convicted of murder for the crime , but Amelia fled the scene . She was n't found . Hotch : Where 's Farland now ? Uh , he served 12 years at Utah state prison . And he was released two days ago . He 's got ta be our unsub . Thanks , Garcia . Here . You did the right thing . I do n't think she would have lasted much longer . What ? I just ca n't believe how much she looks like Miriam . My mom . I should have stopped Amelia , but I did n't kill her . You 're a liar ! Becca . I got blamed ' cause Amelia ran away . But I did n't do it . I loved Miriam . She was everything to me . We do n't remember her that much . We were both pretty young . Well , I 'm sorry about that . I 'm sorry that you do n't even have memories . So where are we gon na hide ? Come on , think about it . You need a place where you 're safe and you can come up with a plan . I do n't know . Ok . Look , I have a buddy who has a cabin in the mountains not far from Park City . Your buddy has a cabin ? His parents do . It 's like a vacation house . They only use it a few times out of the year . The rest of the time it 's empty . We 'll go there tonight . This is awful . Miriam , the sister , was a 29-year-old single mom of two young kids when when was killed . How did Benton only serve 12 years for such a heinous crime ? Well , it was a combination of his age and willingness to testify against Amelia Porter . Ultimately the jury felt he was a sensitive boy who was unduly influenced by an older dominant woman . How did Amelia manage to escape ? She fled into the wilderness . Her father was a survivalist , so she learned outdoor skills from him . Has anyone seen her since then ? That 's a good question .  Garcia 's the name , 411 's the game . Hey , mama , any confirmed sightings of Amelia Porter uh ... in the last 12 years ? Yeah . One 10 years ago . Oh . And one 5 years ago . Both in Canada . One in Vancouver , the latest one in the northern territories . But when authorities got there , she was nowhere to be found . Assuming Benton has a male partner with him , does he have any old friends here he could have reconnected with ? Uh-uh . When he was a teen , he was a total loner . That 's probably the reason why Amelia Porter was able to get him under her thumb so good . All right , we need to look for connections he may have had in jail . Heads up , guys , I got a real bad feeling about this . Clear ! JJ : Clear . Morgan : Guys , over here . The victim is Benton 's father , Oren Farland . You know , this could have been the first kill , the one that triggered the others . Oren lived here with his grandchildren , Andy and Rebecca . The grandchildren are missing . Are these the kids of the sister who got murdered ? Yeah . So what was he after coming out here ? Think about it . Benton was 17 when he went to prison . Reid : You have $40 left after buying a bus ticket with your prison release money . You have no skills to help you survive in the real world , no friends , nowhere to turn but family . Who knows how they 'll feel about seeing you again , but , really , what choice do you have ? Looks like someone was entertaining . I think it was the kids . Thanks for the lemonade . Yeah , sure . Grandpa 's just out buying some groceries . So ... Yeah , you said . So , is old Mr . Litvak still teaching English lit ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . Man , that guy was a ball-buster . But I practically memorized " MacBeth " because of him . " Will all great Neptune 's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand ? "  Where are you guys ? I could use a little help unloading the groceries . Hi , Dad . The kids sat here . Oren sat at the head of the table , which means Benton sat right there . Then why invite him to stay ? Probably to appease him , so he 'd go away peacefully and leave them alone . That obviously did n't happen . So what went wrong ? I just want to say thank you for letting me stay for dinner . Eat up . Then go . Dad , if you 'd just give me a second -- I do n't have any children left . If you 'd just let me explain something . I 'm not interested . Dr . Pelman said that if we do n't forgive , we 'll never heal and move on . Is that the B.S . I pay that quack therapist to tell you ? " Then you will remember your evil ways " and your deeds that were not good . " And you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and your abominations . " You show up like a bad penny to quote scripture to me ? I have repented . I know you 'll never forgive me . But I 'm your own flesh and blood . Do n't you have any feelings for me at all ? The feeling I have for you for you is ... I 'd like to gut you for being the vile bastard that you are ! Andy : Grandpa ! Stop ! Reid : Oren could n't contain is anger . He stood up , threatened Benton , who then stabbed him with the steak knife . I think I know what happened to the kids . Aah ! Ohh ! Ohh ! No ! No ! No , no , no ! No , let her go ! You saw what he was gon na do . He was trying to kill me . I had no choice ! That 's what we 're gon na tell the cops . No , no cops ! They will never believe it . I just got out of prison . They 'll throw me back in there for life ! Ok . Look , we wo n't call them . Benton probably took the kids as an insurance policy . After he murdered his father , he knew the police would n't believe him , so he had to go on the run .  Hey , what you got , baby girl ? I 've confirmed it was n't a random thing that Benton Farland showed up at that office where the security guard was killed , because Andy Farland has a therapist named Dr . Pelman who works there . How long was Andy in therapy ? Uh , 3 years . He was having trouble in school . That 's not a surprise given his mother was murdered by his Uncle . Garcia , did Andy have any contact with Benton when he was in prison ? Uh-huh . Unfortunately , yes . All of it the last two years . He visited him twice , wrote him 3 letters . Contact with Benton may have humanized him . Instead of fearing him , Andy might actually have empathy for him . If you behave ... I promise I wo n't hurt you . You know what that means ? I attract bad luck . Everything I touch turns to garbage . But it 's not my fault . I 'm jinxed . Nothing ever goes my way . You found the money , though , right ? In the backyard ? Yeah . I found the money .  Crap . What do I do ? Pull over . License and registration . Yeah . Is there a problem , officer ? Police radio : We have a 10-57 with multiple injuries on Route 6 near Hawthorne . All units in the area please report . Copy that . Victor 5 on the way . 10-4 , Victor 5 . Your tail light is out . I 'm letting you off with a warning , but get it fixed . Sure thing . Maybe you kids are my lucky charm . We know that after his prison release , Benton Farland went home and murdered his father in an improvised way . He then went over to the Myerson house to dig up money that was buried there . He shot the couple when they surprised him . He 's in an extreme state of mind . He believes that his only choices are fight or flight . Kate : He 's looking for any way he can to escape , which makes him highly unpredictable . JJ : He 's armed and dangerous and he 's already killed 4 victims . Aah ! Reid : Benton is most likely traveling in his father 's automobile . It 's a 1993 gold Volvo , license plate number 631 ZFG . We believe he 's with his niece and nephew , Andy and Rebecca . Andy could be trying to help his Uncle , but Rebecca is most certainly a hostage . Or it could be that Andy is simply trying to protect his sister . You need to increase patrols on major roads leading out of the city . We can not emphasize enough how volatile this situation is . There 's hardly anyone around here . I swear , I wo n't go to the cops . But you said - - I ca n't do that . Enough ! I 'm not going to leave a 16-year-old girl alone on the side of the road . That would be breaking my promise .  Andy !  Aah ! Oh , my God . Are you ok ? Ohh !   Ok , I know Amelia Porter had survival skills , but she must be some sort of a criminal mastermind to have just vanished without a trace for all these years . Maybe she has a new version of Benton helping here . He was n't her first young stud . According to her cousin 's statement , she dated several younger men before Benton , all in their early 20s . Benton was the youngest of the bunch . Makes sense . Younger men were easier to seduce and control . The Farland car was just found . He 's either incredibly lucky or he was allowed to live . Hopefully we 'll be able to get some answers from him soon . No cell phone or I.D . In the woman 's purse . What do you think ? She another hostage ? It 's too many people for Benton to control . I think she was a good Samaritan that stopped to help with the crash , Benton killed her and took her car . We searched a 100-yard perimeter . There 's no sign of Rebecca Farland . So there 's a good chance he has her and that she 's still alive . If that 's the case , what 's he holding her for ? Andy . Agents Callahan and Morgan , FBI . Where 's Rebecca ? We 're looking for her . Can you tell us who shot you ? Benton Farland . My Uncle . He did n't have his seatbelt on , and I crashed the car on purpose . He figured out I was trying to kill him . But you have to find her . Please , he 's gon na kill her . We 're doing everything we can , but right now we need you to help us . Where would he take her ? Um , I told him about my friend 's vacation cabin . We were headed there before the crash . What 's the address ? It 's the yellow house at the end of Canyon Ridge Lane . Please , you have to hurry . She 's gon na say something to set him off .  All right , thanks . Morgan and Kate just left the cabin . No sign of anyone . They should have been there by now . If it was Andy 's suggestion to go there , Benton probably changed his plan after Andy betrayed him . We just found a burned-out car about 50 miles away on Route 190 . Her DMV photo matches the good Samaritan . What are you doing ? Nothing . I 'm tired . And cold . We 've been walking for hours , and my foot hurts . When we get there , you 'll know . My mom used to say that . Well , she got it from our mom . There 's no way you could have remembered that . You were too young . But I do remember . And I remember when I was little and you used to put me on your shoulders so that I could touch the star on our Christmas tree . Yeah , I did do that . How stupid do you think I am ? What ? I - - I do n't - - this trying to bond with me and build rapport is n't going to work . It 's the same crap your brother pulled . You shot him , did n't you ? You told me that Andy died in the accident , but you shot him ! It 's all coming back to me now . He tried to kill me ... And I had to pay him back . It 's only fair ..... Yes , sir . The good new is , there do n't seem to be any human remains inside . Rossi : Any idea why he stopped here ? No , we 're pretty far from anything . Hotch : Any hiking trails nearby that you know of , Detective ? Not any major ones . Hey , Hotch , take a look at this . These treads look remarkably like those from Benton 's shoes . What 's off in that direction ? The summit trail in about 10 miles . That branches into other paths that lead down into a valley . Rossi : Any residents in the valley ? There 's a smattering of small farms and houses . Benton came here on purpose . He has a destination in mind . If it 's not a prison connection , it might be someplace he remembered from his childhood . I 'll follow up with Garcia . I have n't betrayed you . I have n't done anything to hurt you . You have a heart . You 're just snake-bitten like you said . That I am . If you let me go , I swear , I wo n't tell anyone where you are . Here 's what I think . You have n't betrayed me yet , but the first chance you get ... You will . That 's not true . I think it is . But just remember , I always get my payback . Man : Mornin ' ! Hey . Careful up ahead . It looks like part of the path got washed out with the last storm . Ok , well , thanks for the warning . Honey , you look blue as a Popsicle . Did n't you bring your jacket ? You know , I told her to , but , teenagers , right ?  Ai n't that the truth . Have we met before ? You look so familiar . Um ... No , I do n't think so . Yeah . Have a good ' un . Mm-hmm . Andy said his Uncle never mentioned a jailhouse connection . Thank you so much . I just spoke to the prison warden . Benton managed to stay a loner behind bars . He never affiliated with any groups or made friends with other prisoners . That 's not easy to do for 12 years . Most people have an instinct for a social connection . Maybe he had one . Detective : I 'm not following . Well , he did n't need any social connections when he was in prison because he already had one . Amelia Porter . Except she 's somewhere in Canada sleeping among the moose and bears . People also have a natural instinct to return home . Yeah , and Benton did . Yeah , maybe Amelia came home . I 'm going to have Garcia look for women in their 40s who appeared in the area in the last 5 years with little or no history before that . Ok , I searched a 50-mile radius of where the good samaritan 's car was burned and I found not one , but two women who match the criteria we 're looking for . The first is Jane Appleby . She 's lived in the area for 5 years . She 's an organic farmer . I got nothing on her prior to 2009 . And the other ? Uh , that would be Natasha Banks . She 's from Winnipeg , Canada . She 's lived there for 4 years . But when I look her up past 2009 , I ca n't find anything . All right , Dave , you , Kate , and Reid go to Jane Appleby 's house . The rest of us will take Natasha Banks . How did you find me ? You were always prepared for a disaster . I never forgot the old survival plan . That was my plan . You were never a part of it . Does n't she look just like her mother ? Oh , my God . You 're sick . Did you kidnap her ? Did I kidnap you ? No . See ? We like each other . What do you want ? Ca n't you guess ? You know , something 's been bothering me . If Benton always intended to meet Amelia after his release , why did he go home first ? Good question . It was n't just to take revenge on dad . It was n't until after he was on the run that he went to Amelia Porter 's old house . Like he was improvising . Ok , here 's a radical thought . What if Amelia was n't the dominant one ? What if it was really Benton ? The prosecutors called her a femme fatale , always dating younger men . It could have been that she herself was immature . Her parents described her as shy and naive . Only Benton called her manipulative . What 's interesting is Amelia was 30 back then , and his sister was almost the same age at 29 . Benton was always attracted to older women . The fantasy of raping and killing the sister could have been his . When Benton testified , he said that when his mother died when he was 9 , Miriam became his entire world . He could 've been obsessed with her . But Miriam was 21 with a life of her own . If she was absent a lot , that would 've fueled both desire and rage in him . Ohh !  12 years ! I spent 12 years in that hellhole while you got off Scot-free . Stop it ! Just stop it ! I think that 's enough payback . I 'm sorry , sweetheart . But you deserved it . It does n't mean I do n't love you .  The other reason I 'm here and the reason why I brought Rebecca , is so that we could relive the most exciting moment in our lives . Do it . You know you want to . You ca n't make me this time . Make you ? Oh , Amelia , stop lying to yourself . You loved it . It was glorious . I was high . I was out of my mind seeing things . You touched God in that moment . We murdered your sister . FBI ! Drop the weapon ! You 're not taking me with you . He 's crazy . He tried to force me to hurt her .  This coming from the woman who killed Miriam ? You are a madman . And you 're a fugitive from the law . We 've been looking for you for 12 years , Amelia . Amelia : It was him . It was always him . Why did you run ? Who would believe me ? Who would believe me over a 17-year-old boy ? Put the gun down . Your nephew Andy explained how everything happened , Benton . We know none of this was your fault . He 's alive ? He 's in the hospital .  Thank God . Let her go , Benton . O , lord , remember me . remember me . O lord , remember me . remember me . when these chains get broken . set my body free . O lord , remember me ? Kate : " The soul that has conceived one wickedness can nurse no good thereafter . " Sophocles . ? ... I call your name . I call your name . days get long , I call your name . I call your name . days get long . ca n't see right from wrong . O lord , I call your name . I call your name ... You could do worse . So , when are you going to introduce yourself ? Ah , I do n't know , Aaron . I 'm not gon na plan , I 'm just gon na go with the flow and see what opportunities arise . And I suggest you do the same . I 'm here , are n't I ? Yes . That 's a great start . Hello . Um , thanks for the bottle of champagne . Bartender told me you sent it . So much for being a secret admirer .  I 'm Celine Destin . This is my friend Audrey Hansen . David Rossi , and my friend Aaron Hotchner . Hi . How do you do ? Nice to meet you . Hi . Hi , how are you ? Strong , silent types . Intelligent . Honest eyes . So you 're not politicians .  FBI . Wow . You two could be profilers . Well , Audrey practically is . Then welcome to our fair city . And would you ladies care to join us ? I 'll be off at 10:00 , though . Then I 'll be waiting . All right . If you do n't mind ... I 'm going to amble up to the bar for another drink , but , Audrey , please , have a seat . And , um , my friend is known to be an excellent tour guide . Sorry .  Let me guess . Wingman ? Wingwoman ? Mm . More like the sidekick who ca n't carry a tune . ? The best upper sets do it . Lituanians and letts do it ? So is he a heartbreaker ? Well , full disclosure , he has been married 3 times , but ... He 's a solid as they come and he 's learning . Well , good . That 's good . And her ? If he treats her right , she 's a dream . So tell me something . You do n't say .  So if you were to take me on a tour , where would we go ? Well , most people would start with the obvious , the monuments , but there 's some lesser-known places that are very nice . Um , I like the Folger Shakespeare library . The , uh , Moongate Garden at the Smithsonian is really beautiful , especially at sunset . I 've got a few things up my sleeve .
